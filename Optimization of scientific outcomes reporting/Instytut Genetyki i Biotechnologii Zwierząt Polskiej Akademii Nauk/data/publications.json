Twenty multiparous cows, that were three weeks before scheduled calving, had a body condition of 3–3.5, and had not been diagnosed with multiple pregnancies, were qualified for the experiment. The cows were divided into two groups: experimental (FOL) (n = 10) and control (CTL) (n = 10). The CTL group were individually given the standard food ration for dry cows for about 21 days before calving, while the FOL group received food rations that were enriched with 150 g of fish oil and 250 g of linseed (golden variety). Colostrum samples for testing were taken twice a day on the first and second days of lactation, and then once a day from the third to the fifth day of lactation. The experiment showed that the applied supplementation had an impact, in the form of increasing the fat, protein, IgG, IgA, IgM, vitamin A, C22:6 n-3 (DHA), and C18:2 cis9 trans11 (CLA) contents in colostrum; however, the C18: 2 n-6 (LA) and C20:4 n-6 (AA) contents decreased. Due to the lower quality of colostrum found in high-yield cows, and therefore in the Holstein–Friesian breed, it is possible to improve the quality by, among other things, introducing nutritional modifications during the second stage of the dry period."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1-17","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6164f32875234017e05249b5","5e70923d878c28a04739242b","5e70923d878c28a04739243e","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1219"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["colostrum","immunoglobulins","fish oil and linseed supplementation","calves","immunity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058586419"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646b6f8a409707633dfe900f","name":"Alistair B.","lastName":"Lawrence","documentHash":"4b877747-7d6a-48c7-b0a1-a9396215e596"},{"objectId":"646b6f8a409707633dfe900e","name":"Mhairi","lastName":"Jack","documentHash":"4d165e1e-5483-482e-92f2-d9debc97fd8f"},{"objectId":"646b6f8a409707633dfe900d","name":"Mark","lastName":"Brims","documentHash":"25085a39-67d0-4e72-a855-236fe00ffc7b"},{"objectId":"646b6f8a409707633dfe900c","name":"Jo","lastName":"Donbavand","documentHash":"3a141f39-aa23-4a5c-97b7-1dd1e395938c"},{"objectId":"646b6f8a409707633dfe900b","name":"Marianne","lastName":"Farish","documentHash":"be7ee007-b3df-492f-af7c-c86b377aa313"},{"objectId":"646b6f8a409707633dfe900a","name":"Sarah A.","lastName":"Hall","documentHash":"6f85b708-7299-4fed-b476-a9472ea4fa79"},{"objectId":"646b6f8a409707633dfe9009","name":"Emma M.","lastName":"Baxter","documentHash":"1715f7f8-8442-457e-aeb2-4d8d319eb14e"},{"objectId":"5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","name":"Irene","lastName":"Camerlink","uuid":"63511C46590F3B7E26AA60526C552EED8D9F0549F8DEE5333E681582883DA44BB38FF69E2CB85D2955FD7C17DC6CFA4F35E7BE97ABD84CE52B2422233F186398","documentHash":"21f3e447-93d1-4634-92b3-8aae9343fdc4"}],"objectId":"646b6f8a409707633dfe9007","doi":"10.1016/j.animal.2022.100699","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1751731122002567?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Piglets’ behaviour and performance in relation to sow characteristics","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The importance of maternal care in commercial pig production is largely ignored. The sow has little possibility to interact with her piglets, and piglets are often subjected to early weaning or artificial rearing. This study aimed to investigate aspects of physiological and behavioural maternal provisioning that contribute to offspring outcomes. We hypothesised that better maternal care and nutritional provisioning would relate positively to piglet immunity, growth and behaviour. Nineteen sows and their litters were studied in free-farrowing pens. Oxytocin and tumour necrosis factor-α in colostrum/milk and salivary cortisol were sampled from sows throughout lactation. Sows were assessed for dominance rank, response to handling, maternal defensiveness, suckling initiation and termination, posture and sow-piglet contact. Piglets were weighed, measured for body mass index (BMI) and sampled for blood (Immunoglobulin G; at birth). After weaning, they experienced a human approach test (HAT) and novel object test. Correlations were explored between individual sow characteristics, individual piglet outcomes, and between sow characteristics and piglet outcomes averaged by litter. Significant correlations between sow and piglet factors were analysed at the litter level in mixed models with piglet outcomes as response variables and sow characteristics as predictor variables, while accounting for sow parity, litter size and batch. Litters grew faster when their sow had lower cortisol values (P = 0.03), while sows with lower cortisol levels had more successful suckling bouts and engaged in greater amounts of sow-piglet contact. Litters had a lower BMI at weaning when the sow had a higher milk fat percentage at d3. Litters of the most dominant sows took longer to approach the human in the HAT, while litters of sows with higher cortisol at d0 took longer to approach the novel object when assessed on correlations (r = 0.82, P < 0.001) but not when the model accounted for parity and litter size (P = 0.35). Only some of the measured nutritive and non-nutritive sow factors influenced litter performance and behaviour, with parity and litter size also playing a role. Given the continued increase in litter size, but also the interest in loose-housed lactation pens for sows, further research on sows’ maternal investment and how it can be optimised is warranted."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"100699","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646b6f8a409707633dfe9009","646b6f8a409707633dfe900a","646b6f8a409707633dfe900b","646b6f8a409707633dfe900c","646b6f8a409707633dfe900d","646b6f8a409707633dfe900e","646b6f8a409707633dfe900f","5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547702a","mniswId":"1135","title":"Animal.","issn":"1751-7311","eissn":"1751-732X","documentHash":"e50175a9-8850-4e6b-9e0a-0773f1ee47c8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646b6f8a409707633dfe9008","year":"2023","volume":"17","number":"2","documentHash":"3d83bb66-3e25-4406-9d62-34d75c5f84e1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Coping ability, Maternal behaviour, Physiology, Pig, Suckling behaviour"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058640289"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646c80f2409707691c4da75e","name":"Ingrid C.","lastName":"de Jong","documentHash":"ad99e283-e459-42ff-a722-d26d00cb57fc"},{"objectId":"646c80f2409707691c4da75d","name":"Dionne","lastName":"Ruijter","documentHash":"22b00bae-c919-4ae3-8684-1d809091b137"},{"objectId":"646c80f2409707691c4da75c","name":"Elke","lastName":"Rauch","documentHash":"578fad5e-9d01-4aa5-be7f-63f229aa84fd"},{"objectId":"646c80f2409707691c4da75b","name":"Lukas","lastName":"Vogt","documentHash":"e1c4677a-aa7e-4056-8bc1-2cc99b189c03"},{"objectId":"646c80f2409707691c4da75a","name":"Katharina","lastName":"Rath","documentHash":"266c37d7-f9e4-4568-b186-55f293f7b8c0"},{"objectId":"646c80f2409707691c4da759","name":"Helen","lastName":"Louton","documentHash":"4795dbf4-79b1-4f74-8de6-de116686a04a"},{"objectId":"60c334699543c723365440d7","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Sztandarski","uuid":"DB121ECB1867DCEE6DCDFE72BBFCB495A3B8319D29FC1110A9E66DA325C15BD3E61BC3DA535901104DB03EB52A2F9FAB2EC0DA3171D22CA03C987336A1169A15","orcidId":"0000-0003-1304-6780","documentHash":"d8d49d3c-0d8c-4213-a679-29abd438b564"},{"objectId":"5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Marchewka","uuid":"EC0F04392DD656A21DC052B59B1A2D8E5A03749BA0461B4AFF6E8CCF5C15DE33EA901A402324204CF8155923E33B80BE4DC420B7AA2054A864B93FC416AA4F24","orcidId":"0000-0002-9571-8677","documentHash":"77dd006d-9494-445c-b9e3-36c4addbec89"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a0473998b4","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Solka","uuid":"C84D179BD3A4F48607BDFD967DC14CAA9829D6A071CD038C1D50EDB7F259D3937080C700BAC1F79331F59F5BBA74D03970276E2690E33579AD02CA2C27713F28","orcidId":"0000-0003-1421-5400","documentHash":"9a872c7e-9fe1-4108-9d31-2c191937040d"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399193","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Horbańczuk","uuid":"976205AE9A3DD4FA85531EB44854AE0083FBAD6743C6797D800A9669BD6FAED38693031A6C16E0A03AAE6903DEB2CEF4B47FFF137CB5399DCB5BFBCFCFF25343","orcidId":"0000-0002-7561-0941","documentHash":"a9235661-fb2e-4102-b6a6-35060d6414c3"}],"objectId":"646c80f2409707691c4da757","doi":"10.1016/j.psj.2022.102384","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0032579122006782?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Linking key husbandry factors to the intrinsic quality of broiler meat","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Broiler farming is the fastest-growing animal production sector and broiler meat is the second most-consumed meat in the world. The intensification of broiler production often has a negative impact on the meat quality and carcass characteristics. Consumers, however, expect a quality product from animals reared extensively on farms providing good animal welfare, often intuitively associated with extensive farming practices. Therefore, this literature review investigates how the critical factors contributing to the degree of extensiveness of broiler production affect the quality of meat. We used the data from scientific articles published in the years 2012-2021 to analyze the effect of diet (n = 409), genetics (n = 86), enrichment (n = 25), and stocking density (n = 20) on meat quality and carcass characteristics. Minerals and microelements supplementation in the diet improved all the meat quality aspects: sensory, physical, and chemical in most studies. Minerals and enzymes in the diet had beneficial effects on carcass characteristics, unlike feed restriction and ingredient substitutions. The impact of outdoor access on meat quality and carcass characteristics was most frequently examined, in contrast to the use of perches or effects of litter quality. Overall, enrichment did not affect the meat's sensory or physical parameters, but outdoor access improved its lipid composition. Lower stocking density deteriorated intramuscular fat content, decreased tenderness and juiciness, yet lowered cooking and drip loss, and increased carcass and breast muscle yields. When it comes to genetics, in general, slow growing broiler strains have better meat quality parameters, especially regarding yellowness (b*), redness (a*), cooking and drip loss. Our review shows that the factors which contribute to extensiveness of broiler production systems and birds' welfare also affect meat quality and the carcass characteristics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a0473998b4","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","60c334699543c723365440d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"102","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"102384","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","60c334699543c723365440d7","5e7092a1878c28a0473998b4","646c80f2409707691c4da759","646c80f2409707691c4da75a","646c80f2409707691c4da75b","646c80f2409707691c4da75c","646c80f2409707691c4da75d","646c80f2409707691c4da75e","5e70929c878c28a047399193"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547934f","mniswId":"16421","title":"POULTRY SCIENCE","issn":"0032-5791","documentHash":"811483b7-60e4-4554-a4b1-68c7cbbfdd17"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646c80f2409707691c4da758","year":"2023","volume":"102","number":"2","documentHash":"ccd63288-b810-4056-81e8-991cbaaae85a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["broiler; diet; enrichment; genetics; stocking density."]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058643815"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646b6d6b409707633dfe5eb7","name":"Jianke","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"1722e7eb-a5d8-4c70-9716-e1ba155813a6"},{"objectId":"646b6d6b409707633dfe5eb6","name":"Jiying","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"195a1286-d387-4b02-9136-48703999c2b1"},{"objectId":"646b6d6b409707633dfe5eb5","name":"Jiaojiao","lastName":"Yuan","documentHash":"9dbf510b-e087-4248-a0c5-0ed04e7b2396"},{"objectId":"646b6d6b409707633dfe5eb4","name":"Guowei","lastName":"Shu","documentHash":"8d7c0f09-13e7-4a86-9680-e6df5d51081a"},{"objectId":"646b6d6b409707633dfe5eb3","name":"Linlin","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"ff64618c-071f-44ce-9a7d-79ac78225e48"},{"objectId":"633e3da97523402e340f9cea","name":"Li","lastName":"Chen","uuid":"DA6D944797DD85D567FAAF68136D03D1DA2A57DAE89A267ADAA626C6C5FB657C54C0AD48252F51747B871248C3569F1B2C22B9B98BDFF5FEBB29FE0918CA4FAC","documentHash":"c888f9d4-f822-4958-8928-be3e448bbecf"}],"objectId":"646b6d6b409707633dfe5eb1","doi":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.134745","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0308814622027078?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Enhanced antihypertensive potential of fermented pomegranate juice: The contribution of phenolic compounds biotransformation and the resultant angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibition mechanism","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Current research on plant food-derived phenolic compounds as angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been well documented.

This study firstly highlights the relationship between the enhanced ACE inhibitory activity in fermented PJ and the biotransformation of phenolic compounds, providing a new way to reinforce plant food ACE inhibition potential by microbial fermentation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["633e3da97523402e340f9cea"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"404","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"134745","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["633e3da97523402e340f9cea","646b6d6b409707633dfe5eb3","646b6d6b409707633dfe5eb4","646b6d6b409707633dfe5eb5","646b6d6b409707633dfe5eb6","646b6d6b409707633dfe5eb7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477d0f","mniswId":"6692","title":"Food Chemistry","issn":"0308-8146","eissn":"0308-8146","websiteLink":"http://www.elsevier.com/locate/foodchem","documentHash":"81ff2ff9-7514-4afc-897c-f6bb63788094"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646b6d6b409707633dfe5eb2","year":"2023","volume":"404","documentHash":"a2296d4b-9e1b-42a3-af61-d96b29eec563"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ACE inhibition; Antioxidant capacity; Bioactive compounds; Lactobacillus plantarum; Pomegranate juice; Structure and activity relationship"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058694562"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"643bea234097076e1ee0dc9d","name":"Marija","lastName":"Klopcic","documentHash":"b08bc17a-5f8e-4ba7-9bca-58575e03d127"},{"objectId":"617e0db87523400564d62e5b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kostusiak","uuid":"E44C651AF7B112EF89210EF2A48E5CC9C383089C74D82AEE233509C82E8AA58C3915E7D60BEFD2E3E67EC9D083E059FA0B8E3108FF714EF603B8F2A2295C9065","documentHash":"5382c511-5114-44e2-87cd-d4dc35003a5e"},{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e05249b5","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Grodkowska","uuid":"BDE2B929C64652136162FC978C9F7EA8A02D1C12D63B08F32460FBA036938D508F114C6030704022E35EEDF4B56AAB412F37CC4FC599748DE81D331DF9349CD1","orcidId":"0000-0002-9607-8333","documentHash":"9307362b-33bd-4d9a-b65a-acd5bef59f4e"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c1219","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Puppel","uuid":"DEFEB63897F4F677A6CACA13ABFD34912211F95BF6CE2238766912236D9783431A6B9E42EDC1245BBBA673896CBE70F00EA48A69C1CE2BD9C9854DCE4DC2AEF9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2909-2087","documentHash":"d972e1dc-9c57-4327-bd08-47b85900ff9f"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bbad","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Grodkowski","uuid":"72FBB18F86C85BE1CBEAD356FAF8043E8D36F7FC5B5A8B558556B3F60582FFE6C76E3894D90A46AA91518934931833FC1FBC658BD97C3872EB51FCD22CF13954","orcidId":"0000-0001-5715-6514","documentHash":"64f577bd-f1f2-4d18-8a69-b2b2dd67aa62"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Sakowski","uuid":"C87300CD8C2E2C660E7BA7643D2648CA6260BCA2F36C89DE3CE9CA734753DCBC23AA717DC64FD468245A05CBE16B5C43FBA0570AE5ECA8CFC6CBF48252E899D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-2264-4638","documentHash":"cfaaf5aa-3854-4022-a3c5-b8e2e8624a3e"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739243e","name":"Jan","lastName":"Slósarz","uuid":"38B15DEE9EFDE400D2DBCC3E239D9097D02F1092EEFF364624F890250436AAC10C23D8B77C00A81FCC286F929669C3C98EB19C807812C0378E15C7BACEE3DFB7","orcidId":"0000-0002-5254-3993","documentHash":"6925a48d-0bcd-4d5a-93af-46e99a95477a"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739242b","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Gołębiewski","uuid":"E0571A2599BAA13E2D0F0789A64421D0D0CA49DE019A5BCAF3CB7ADE6F5D674058AFAA4560A9879B9BAB3B2B650B7B7C6F9346150BECF48A566D6F546E79A3B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-0645-433X","documentHash":"bf6f9482-28bb-4cc8-a602-916803d95c81"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"643bea234097076e1ee0dc97","doi":"10.3390/ani13030540","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/3/540","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Effect of Parity on the Quality of Colostrum of Holstein Dairy Cows in the Organic Production System","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A special feature of organic production systems is the cows’ significantly lower productivity,\r\nwhich is adapted to environmental conditions. The quantity and quality of colostrum is negatively\r\ncorrelated, high amounts of colostrum are associated with low amounts of immunoglobulins. Cows’\r\nparity is also a modulating factor, and studies have shown an increase in colostral IgG corresponds\r\nwith increasing parity. This study’s aim was to determine the effect of cows’ parity on colostrum\r\nquality, in an organic farm setting. From a basic organic herd of dairy cattle, 40 Polish Holstein–\r\nFriesian cows were selected: 10 cows each of primiparous, second lactation, fourth lactation, and\r\nfifth lactation. Colostrum and transition milk samples were taken from each cow seven times:\r\ntwice daily on the 1st and 2nd days after calving (every 12 h), and once daily on the 3rd to 5th\r\ndays. Multiparous cows’ colostrum had higher levels of total proteins, casein, and non-fat dry\r\nmatter, versus primiparous. Only cows in the second and fourth lactations produced very good\r\nquality colostrum (with immunoglobulins over 50 g/L), meeting standards for immunoglobulin\r\nconcentration. In conclusion, the production of very good quality colostrum is limited during the first\r\nlactation, which may suggest the mammary gland is poorly developed, and, thus, immunoglobulin\r\ntransport is limited. Variability in the colostrum’s immunoglobulin content from first and second\r\ncollections post-calving was higher in multiparous versus primiparous cows. Therefore, it should\r\nbe good practice to freeze colostrum from multiparous cows in case of poor-quality primiparous\r\ncolostrum."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1-14","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6164f32875234017e05249b5","5e70923d878c28a04739242b","5e70923d878c28a04739243e","5e7092bc878c28a04739bbad","617e0db87523400564d62e5b","643bea234097076e1ee0dc9d","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1219","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","eissn":"2076-2615","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"cf012089-3ed8-4dde-a05c-d5b280240cb4"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["colostrum","cow","immunoglobulin","density","age of cows","organic production"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058739476"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65e5a2b14097076263cf9681","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Brzozowska","documentHash":"33bcbfe9-295a-4746-af45-b8776cd61d65"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b57e9","name":"Renata","lastName":"Grochowska","uuid":"DA8459993CBA7FE4F13047054854719347893D58BE56D623F2FC18CF6D8A0AE3D597E4365A31E9A5BC33CC39266BB06B35A9FEBA2C197ACD722D3557A6EDA49B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0102-953X","documentHash":"9c5fb522-ed6d-4547-a386-b4a4a039f826"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af9fb","name":"Kacper","lastName":"Żukowski","uuid":"21CE375A6D7D66C70ADA01EF0762ECB1AC39C82E37B7F5004590E9F7EBDFBB939F90C5D539ED78ACEAB378F99F90DDE20038D563F7A8A40DCF5D1BFBFBADD2B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-5690-3634","documentHash":"e832dd64-4052-4f25-ba50-084e67f9d6f3"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a04739966f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Bagnicka","uuid":"0D37A8BCF2F4D93F59FC1D87DBDADCE868EF14AFD99EBF96C877CC86963C73AE2E470CED6B83A3F731B3B08724BDCE11D9A8CE8A0CE7E36513995F6A5C4D000D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7193-2006","documentHash":"a42098e0-b6d5-4d75-b67b-2d9b112c9c92"}],"objectId":"646cad34409707691c521109","doi":"10.2478/aoas-2022-0091","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The association of gene polymorphisms with milk production and mastitis resistance phenotypic traits in dairy cattle","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65e5a2b14097076263cf9681","5e70929f878c28a04739966f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","uid":"biMkjldDwyEilXl7rx-ushQ","uuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","name":"Instytut Zootechniki -

Animals have more\r\ndifficulty accessing pasture feed and require more time to consume the equivalent amount of dry\r\nmatter compared to total mixed ration (TMR) feed from a feed table. The study was conducted during\r\nAugust 2016–October 2017 on 64 Holstein-Friesian (HF) cows and 54 Brown Swiss (BS) cows. All\r\nanimals were equipped with CowManager sensor devices, and the cows’ behaviors were recorded:\r\ntime spent on feed intake, rumination, physical activity, and rest. In winter, cows were mainly fed hay,\r\nwhile in summer, they took forage from the pasture or freshly cut forage provided in the barn. The\r\nstudy showed that the time of day had a significant (p < 0.001) effect on the cows’ feeding behaviors.\r\nThe study also showed behavioral differences between HF and BS breeds. HF cows, regardless of the\r\nlocation and type of feed provided, spent more time on feed intake and chewed less compared to\r\nthe BS breed. These differences were observable in all studied lactation groups.

The aim of the study was to analyze the nanomechanical properties of C. albicans cells derived from the oral cavity of healthy people in a biofilm produced in laboratory conditions. Candida spp. were sampled from the oral cavity of healthy individuals. The process of biofilm formation was analyzed using classic microscopic observation enriched with SEM (scanning electron microscope) and the nanomechanical properties of the cells were assessed with the use of the atomic force microscopy technique (AFM). From all isolated strains in the samples collected of the oral cavity healthy people was detected 79% C. albicans. Other isolated species belonged to the group „non-albicans”. The observations of C. albicans carried out in 24-h cultures revealed a tendency of the cells to form a biofilm structure with multilayer cell systems. The diameter of C. albicans cells in this structure was 5.75 µm, and the length of the pseudohyphae was 17.08 µm. The presence of an extracellular substance surrounding the C. albicans cells was detected. The mean value of the adhesion force determined for C. albicans cells was 4.01 nN. Areas with increased hardness (Force Modulation Mode signal; FMM signal) were found mainly in the zones of cells in contact with the glass substrate. The analysis of Candida cells in liquid samples gives satisfactory results, as it prevents unfavorable changes in the cell surface and thus provides more reliable results. The quality of the biofilm is probably related to the nanomechanical properties of C. albicans cells and may consequently contribute to the stability of the biofilm structures and their susceptibility or resistance to antifungal drugs. The presence of Candida spp. especially in companion animals (dogs, cats) poses a risk of their transmission to the human organism. For this reason, it is advisable to undertake additional research to analyze the ability of zoonotic-origin Candida spp. to form biofilms with comparison of the biofilm-formation capacity of species isolated from humans."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","uid":"b8lEq4e8f8p1V09_nBsO4Ew","uuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","name":"Akademia Bialska im.

Forty multiparous (second and third lactation) Holstein–Friesian cows were selected that had 81 ± 12 days in milk and produced 15.08 ± 1.20 kg of milk/day. Two groups were created for the experiment: control (CTL; n = 20) and experimental (LC; n = 20). The experiment was divided into two periods: an initial period lasting 7 days in which the experimental group was habituated to the new supplement in their diet; the proper experimental phase, lasting 6 weeks, in which the cows in\r\nthe experimental group received an individual daily dose of linseed cake (300 g/day/cow). Linseed cake supplementation had a positive impact on the levels of bioactive components (fatty-acid profile and fat-soluble vitamins) in the milk fat fraction. At the end of the trial, the concentration of C18:2\r\ncis9 trans11, C18:1 trans11, α-retinol, α-tocopherol, and total antioxidant status increased 1.59-, 1.94-, 3.12-, 3.38-, and 3.09-fold, respectively, relative to the control levels.

different calf rearing systems on calf health, behavior,\r\nmeat quality, and oxidative stability. The study involved two groups of bull calves: conventionally\r\npenned calves (control, fed with use of automatic feeders) and calves reared alongside foster cows\r\n(experimental). The presence of foster cows was found to have a significant positive influence on\r\ncalf health. Calves raised with foster cows experienced lower rates of diarrhea, delayed instances of\r\ncoughing, and a reduced occurrence of rhinitis compared to conventionally reared calves. Behavioral\r\nobservations revealed differences in sucking and licking behaviors between the two groups. Calves\r\nwith foster cows displayed more consistent patterns of these behaviors, while conventionally reared\r\ncalves exhibited greater variability. Additionally, the experimental group consistently achieved\r\nhigher daily weight gains, suggesting the potential for larger and more valuable carcasses at slaughter.\r\nImportantly, there were no significant differences in the quality of veal between the two rearing\r\ngroups. This included fatty acid composition, color attributes, and myoglobin levels, indicating\r\nconsistent meat quality. In summary, this research highlights the advantages of rearing systems that\r\nprioritize calf health and behavior, emphasizing maternal care and natural behaviors. Such systems\r\nhold promise for improving calf welfare and enhancing the sustainability of the meat production\r\nindustry. The integration of foster cows into dairy farming practices emerges as a practical and\r\neffective approach, particularly for the rearing of bull calves."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-23","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092bc878c28a04739bb6a","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0","5e70923d878c28a04739242b","5e70923d878c28a04739243e","5e7092bc878c28a04739bbad","6164f32875234017e05249b5","65621cd540970749a8ce20f2","65621cd540970749a8ce20f3","65621cd540970749a8ce20f4","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1219"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","eissn":"2077-0472","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"fb8db9b6-d4d7-498a-b26c-2119c1ad43da"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["calves","health","behavior","veal","oxidative stress","fatty acids"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059021209"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b0358a4097071977895569","name":"Tino","lastName":"Schenk","documentHash":"af48228b-ad40-4c78-b64b-94149a25f571"},{"objectId":"65b0358a4097071977895568","name":"Anna","lastName":"Papierniak-Wyglądała","documentHash":"54ba5d62-7ba8-402f-8084-c75cd6ef41d9"},{"objectId":"633503297523402e340d736c","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kaczor-Keller","uuid":"246716A9AB0FFDECE97B6137F71FD1CC1A6243444E147B4AE10737777C2F266A53A7DEB1939D6A1E579BBFE779F4DCFA0B4606434102252FB6AB9687946A9944","documentHash":"b376dd2b-36ee-4021-a128-808361d80efd"},{"objectId":"5ed5cda37523404d1000e898","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Skopek","uuid":"0AE3B047D8E7BC1914123C976AF2B98EA7E2ACD71221339E8C330A680FA5A592C1CB541F5F6D900A300C91F783FE1B05BD6CED2CE9EACB5648A3AADA378CE528","orcidId":"0000-0002-8669-3359","documentHash":"179efcd0-da33-4a49-8ccf-9abd1184d7fa"},{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7b57","name":"Artur","lastName":"Zelent","uuid":"CE00BA5E249ADE8E21AB91CCA3B5C74221AD6C1CDA96BFC193212A8EFF1502AE0D6BC448AD14453FCA14C4B0EBB73D1E49A97FE100692C0E3B22F1B4EB2D728C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7968-9888","documentHash":"9c74bd28-fe98-4bcc-9ad8-a6da6ae1d62b"},{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b7748","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Pingwara","uuid":"F501E023997F7E840F466A99324262B40FFE62749158ECB4933EA27D646052A57FC1A69810EFB2A3121236DD411E36F561FAE37B70353EA72B9BDDB419EE0010","orcidId":"0000-0001-8650-1161","documentHash":"61e883c7-9364-401a-85f5-1c1ca2e072ac"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a63","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Lewicki","uuid":"B90CF686103E1B1C6A43B2B48DF9445471E971741F9FEE62AD82AB04CF07C8D5E669352FED8A72279F83B28CEFE41F2B89D4E1A814514D3B03BD970250CE91BF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0539-0680","documentHash":"b3e5410d-c6e6-42f2-a407-b5005f052984"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"92D7C04F8AB3A7BAFDD427A486DDA8E51BB9EF910CE1748A4A41C1B5DD9D2FBC73939751C42B68AF9AB4431CFBC5570C935A57B7BE63B7045AA234AF1888672B","documentHash":"da59b83b-fda3-4817-8136-ba0e1298aa2f"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6651","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Palusińska","uuid":"E293BF36A5F1AAC47479642F0D371CE1986419C5F1BF94A35EE49B9A2E6D65F62609B6F27291B5D55AF41F11EC7064D2CA1F26ADE5F469B2C87FDF3D9F477D67","orcidId":"0000-0002-0399-5280","documentHash":"84c80e3b-8c29-4925-ace5-3eb2249f6df5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6532f00940970712f7d3c694","doi":"10.3390/ijms24065377","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Choosing the Right Cell Line for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Research","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Immortalized cell lines are widely used in vitro tools in oncology and hematology research. While these cell lines represent artificial systems and may accumulate genetic aberrations with each passage, they are still considered valuable models for pilot, preliminary, and screening studies. Despite their limitations, cell lines are cost-effective and provide repeatable and comparable results. Choosing the appropriate cell line for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) research is crucial for obtaining reliable and relevant results. Several factors should be considered when selecting a cell line for AML research, such as specific markers and genetic abnormalities associated with different subtypes of AML. It is also essential to evaluate the karyotype and mutational profile of the cell line, as these can influence the behavior and response to the treatment of the cells. In this review, we evaluate immortalized AML cell lines and discuss the issues surrounding them concerning the revised World Health Organization and the French–American–British classifications.</jats:p>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6651","633503297523402e340d736c","5ed5cda37523404d1000e898","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","5e7094f3878c28a0473c7b57"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcdd","uid":"bGQD3DecPtSFB4Gy_K5hgDA","uuid":"7cb54454-df9a-464f-80aa-5ce2185526ba","name":"Uczelnia Medyczna im.

Cows","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Industrial fruit by-products are now being utilized as animal feeds for several reasons. They may substitute the conventional cereal feeds, and also offer economic and environmental benefits. One of the most important industrial fruit by-products is apple pomace, which can be used as a source of energy in the ration of ruminant species, including dairy cattle. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of feeding dried apple pomace to dairy cattle on ruminal fermentation, fatty acid concentration, microbial populations, and methane production. The experiment lasted 64 days and was conducted with 4 cannulated commercial dairy cows. The control animals received a standard diet, while the experimental animals was fed a standard diet supplemented with 150 g/kg DM dried apple pomace. Ruminal fluid samples were collected at three different time intervals. The samples were obtained at 0-, 3-, and 6-h post-feeding. The ruminal fluid was used to assess the ammonia concentration, pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA), long-chain fatty acids (FA), microbial population. A number of ruminal fermentation variables changed as a result of the addition of dried apple pomace to the standard diet. Ruminal pH slightly increased (p < 0.01) while the ammonia concentration decreased (p < 0.01) by 46%. There was a significant decrease in total protozoa count (p < 0.01) and an increase (p < 0.01) in total volatile fatty acids. In addition, there was a decline in methane emission (p = 0.05) by 8% due to dried apple pomace feeding. To sum up, this study demonstrated a positive effect of 150 g/kg DM dietary dried apple pomace on ruminal metabolism including a decrease in ammonia concentration and methane emissions, alongside with an increase in total ruminal VFAs, higher nutrient digestibility, and milk production. Also, beneficial changes to the ruminal fatty acid profile resulting from reduced biohydrogenation were observed although a decreased content of the C18:2 cis 9 trans 11 isomer was also noticed. The dietary inclusion of DAP can serve as a valuable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly dietary component for dairy cows."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709344878c28a0473a6204","5e7093e2878c28a0473b28d6","5e709344878c28a0473a6212","5e709347878c28a0473a6489","5e709347878c28a0473a63ab","656b0889409707068891be48"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a047399828","5e7092ae878c28a04739a77f","5e70929c878c28a047399193"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"2032","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656b0889409707068891be46","656b0889409707068891be47","656b0889409707068891be48","656b0889409707068891be4c","5e709347878c28a0473a6489","5e7093e2878c28a0473b28d6","5e709347878c28a0473a63ab","5e7092a1878c28a047399828","5e709344878c28a0473a6204","656b0889409707068891be4d","656b0889409707068891be4e","656b0889409707068891be50","5e709344878c28a0473a6212","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7092ae878c28a04739a77f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","issn":"2077-0472","eissn":"2077-0472","documentHash":"f51997b3-f7b4-40a9-9013-a896e341e147"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"651295e440970729413cd179","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"10","documentHash":"56a7a74f-c9f4-47e2-8729-cb8c782b53c0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059059193"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abeb5","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Pogorzelska-Nowicka","uuid":"AB3AFAA01F01C083F008B905F3D9252CBE66B5E205C27B83211E754F6E7781D7358B2B471079281FF89458F67861E7B902980DE22B7DEE40BCD5934A367B47B8","orcidId":"0000-0002-8297-1868","documentHash":"9d56b69a-14af-42cd-b7c6-6c36194fe2f5"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a540a","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"POGORZELSKI","uuid":"F9ADBD097E2AF439B8E96D89EE30B897B4E1C54A67E66B4F819B806534AF62155B995E1A8C58939DA9050468E186D8DAAE2B44FFCD23B30A21264E1B6C69E5A3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3443-4571","documentHash":"4ba9e90d-7fc2-45f4-aa00-f2bf2b64d676"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739228b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wierzbicka","uuid":"B0DDE44760A24226E4305C616289112453E9EC132DFA6F00E0894A86B7405F22A4A2EBA701343A0E1B561FC95399D36295B388AE3233A9276C697969DCF8F290","orcidId":"0000-0002-5770-4573","documentHash":"27d4f042-4168-4ed2-85a4-49da76166ba4"}],"objectId":"6562da8f40970749a8d7a3e6","doi":"10.2478/aspr-2023-0005","publicUri":"https://www.igbzpan.pl/uploaded/FSiBundleContentBlockBundleModelTranslatableBlockTranslatableFilesElement/filePath/2373/str153-164.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Effects of pelvic suspension of beef carcasses and wet aging time of cuts on eating quality and sensory scores of 14 muscles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"To evaluate the effect of carcass hanging method and aging period on beef eating quality young cross-breed bulls were slaughtered in a slaughterhouse in south-eastern Poland.

Additionally, we also tested the circadian changes in gene expression and the decay time of transcriptomic response to corticosterone. Gene expression was analyzed using microarrays. Obtained results show that transcriptomic responses to glucocorticoids are heterogeneous in terms of the decay time with some genes displaying persistent changes in expression during 9 h of rest. We have also found a considerable overlap between genes regulated by corticosterone and genes implicated previously in stress response. The examples of such genes are Acer2, Agt, Apod, Aqp4, Etnppl, Fabp7, Fam107a, Fjx1, Fmo2, Galnt15, Gjc2, Heph, Hes5, Htra1, Jdp2, Kif5a, Lfng, Lrg1, Mgp, Mt1, Pglyrp1, Pla2g3, Plin4, Pllp, Ptgds, Ptn, Slc2a1, Slco1c1, Sult1a1, Thbd and Txnip.

Goat breed and number of lactation affected energy-corrected milk, value-corrected milk yield, fat corrected milk, protein, casein, lactose contents and free fatty acids. Additionally, differences in non-fat solids and urea contents were found between two Polish common dairy breeds White Improved (PWI) and Fawn Improved (PFI) goats. Moreover, parity affected milk yield, its acidity and somatic cell count (SCC). Milk yield and milk components were found to vary according to lactation stage. At the beginning of lactation, milk is richer in ingredients which have effect on cheese and yoghurt production. All the goats undergo similar changes related to the lactation stage that is at the same time and this can affect the yield and quality of the curd. In production focused on liquid milk, the age structure of the herd should be properly managed, as the goats in their third lactation or above have higher milk yields, regardless of breed. For cheese production, the PWI breed would be more suitable than PFI as the PWI goat milk contains less SCC and more components essential for milk processing, including caseins."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929f878c28a04739966f","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a5c","65b00b7340970719778948ef"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"115-130","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b00b7340970719778948ef","65b00b7340970719778948f0","65b00b7340970719778948f1","5e7093e7878c28a0473b2ff8","65b00b7340970719778948f3","65b00b7340970719778948f4","5e70929f878c28a04739966f","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a5c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d6bc","mniswId":"20677","title":"Acta Universitatis Cibiniensis - Series E: Food Technology","issn":"1221-4973","eissn":"2344-150X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"76ab933d-55dd-477b-aef4-d38f7ac2f25c"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["goat","parity","stage of lactation","milk yield"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059321174"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b8e08a4097073e10aae63b","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Lewicka","documentHash":"0191645d-8964-4a11-850e-055e5901e8d4"},{"objectId":"65b8e08a4097073e10aae63a","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szarpak","documentHash":"81716d19-4ba4-4e7e-b2ee-dd5367b41621"},{"objectId":"65b8e08a4097073e10aae639","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Hovagimyan","documentHash":"839f3c1e-1bf6-4b2f-b9e3-554b7509c620"},{"objectId":"65b8e08a4097073e10aae638","name":"Michał","lastName":"Zwoliński","documentHash":"95fc60ab-e330-49e6-a0e4-50eab2fe45bd"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a63","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Lewicki","uuid":"B90CF686103E1B1C6A43B2B48DF9445471E971741F9FEE62AD82AB04CF07C8D5E669352FED8A72279F83B28CEFE41F2B89D4E1A814514D3B03BD970250CE91BF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0539-0680","documentHash":"b3e5410d-c6e6-42f2-a407-b5005f052984"},{"objectId":"5e7093fa878c28a0473b450f","name":"Zygmunt","lastName":"Pojda","uuid":"4D8A0EB2D7C1103E73AE4BDD19BF8C9101AA5A0CA0A13E2B693FBB4BCDBE635DFBDF38E00D91873803B756B03220E9EA5366EC8D61CADB99634A28CD1EB8AE88","orcidId":"0000-0001-5562-4433","documentHash":"63c5409a-6cbd-4245-a7f4-694d7548a525"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abe86","name":"Marta","lastName":"Stelmasiak","uuid":"0F8AF02037213210BAA257897CE8ABB198EDAE1EEFF298BEE6FDC87644ED90506B369BEBE66A3A012C0D321ABCD422C4EFA5EA16906943FFF34D798021FE1D6E","documentHash":"649c73d1-51e2-4f06-ac3a-21fbff3680d4"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"92D7C04F8AB3A7BAFDD427A486DDA8E51BB9EF910CE1748A4A41C1B5DD9D2FBC73939751C42B68AF9AB4431CFBC5570C935A57B7BE63B7045AA234AF1888672B","documentHash":"da59b83b-fda3-4817-8136-ba0e1298aa2f"}],"objectId":"65b8e08a4097073e10aae636","doi":"10.3390/ijms25010030","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Chitosan-Based Dressing as a Sustained Delivery System for Bioactive Cytokines","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Wounds represent a common occurrence in human life. Consequently, scientific investigations are underway to advance wound healing methodologies, with a notable focus on dressings imbued with biologically active compounds capable of orchestrating the wound microenvironment through meticulously regulated release mechanisms. Among these bioactive agents are cytokines, which, when administered to the wound milieu without appropriate protection, undergo rapid loss of their functional attributes. Within the context of this research, we present a method for fabricating dressings enriched with G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) or GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), showcasing both biological activity and protracted release dynamics. Based on Ligasano, a commercial polyurethane foam dressing, and chitosan crosslinked with TPP (sodium tripolyphosphate), these dressings are noncytotoxic and enable cytokine incorporation. The recovery of cytokines from dressings varied based on the dressing preparation and storage techniques (without modification, drying, freeze-drying followed by storage at 4 °C or freeze-drying followed by storage at 24 °C) and cytokine type. Generally, drying reduced cytokine levels and their bioactivity, especially with G-CSF. The recovery of G-CSF from unmodified dressings was lower compared to GM-CSF (60% vs. 80%). In summary, our freeze-drying approach enables the storage of G-CSF or GM-CSF enriched dressings at 24 °C with minimal cytokine loss, preserving their biological activity and thus enhancing future clinical availability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

We present here a new chromosome-scale genome of the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus), which includes the complete sequence of all centromeres. Gerbils are thus the one of the first vertebrates to have their centromeres completely sequenced. Gerbil centromeres are composed of four different repeats of length 6, 37, 127, or 1,747 bp, which occur in simple alternating arrays and span 1-6 Mb. Gerbil genomes have both an extensive set of GC-rich genes and chromosomes strikingly enriched for constitutive heterochromatin. We sought to determine if there was a link between these two phenomena and found that the two heterochromatic chromosomes of the Mongolian gerbil have distinct underpinnings: Chromosome 5 has a large block of intraarm heterochromatin as the result of a massive expansion of centromeric repeats, while chromosome 13 is comprised of extremely large (>150 kb) repeated sequences. In addition to characterizing centromeres, our results demonstrate the importance of including karyotypic features such as chromosome number and the locations of centromeres in the interpretation of genome sequence data and highlight novel patterns involved in the evolution of chromosomes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["612d94299543c7051ff01b22"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"40","issue":"5","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["662b65304097075aa60d4398","662b65304097075aa60d4399","662b65304097075aa60d439a","662b65304097075aa60d439b","662b65304097075aa60d439c","662b65304097075aa60d439d","612d94299543c7051ff01b22","662b65304097075aa60d439e","662b65304097075aa60d439f","662b65304097075aa60d43a0","662b65304097075aa60d43a1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478edc","mniswId":"14527","title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","issn":"0737-4038","eissn":"1537-1719","documentHash":"13e6cb7c-0fdd-4a31-9223-b0eeb0f1195f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"649032d340970747b95fad8e","year":"2023","volume":"40","number":"5","documentHash":"38385275-d9d9-4d67-9fc1-9d8d1881b2e8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Meriones, genome, karyotype, centromeres, chromosome evolution"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059574852"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66308e664097071c38a3b3b0","name":"Harald","lastName":"Willschke","documentHash":"771f5e31-24b3-49f1-a5d7-84b24a279357"},{"objectId":"66308e664097071c38a3b3af","name":"Oliver","lastName":"Kimberger","documentHash":"70dc4992-2f0f-4c04-8fdd-04d8a3826e04"},{"objectId":"66308e664097071c38a3b3ae","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kletecka-Pulker","documentHash":"0740ef5d-e5c6-4c18-a7a8-fcf33a12714e"},{"objectId":"66308e664097071c38a3b3ac","name":"Emil D","lastName":"Parvanov","documentHash":"83186afc-7785-46ae-8763-5455fa26d39c"},{"objectId":"66308e664097071c38a3b3ab","name":"Andy Wai Kan","lastName":"Yeung","documentHash":"9b2ccdfb-8bf6-45f8-8a38-0c7adc52af82"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399193","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Horbańczuk","uuid":"976205AE9A3DD4FA85531EB44854AE0083FBAD6743C6797D800A9669BD6FAED38693031A6C16E0A03AAE6903DEB2CEF4B47FFF137CB5399DCB5BFBCFCFF25343","orcidId":"0000-0002-7561-0941","documentHash":"a9235661-fb2e-4102-b6a6-35060d6414c3"}],"objectId":"66308e664097071c38a3b3aa","doi":"10.1177/20552076231179053","publicUri":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20552076231179053","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Are dental x-rays safe?

Finally, 45 videos (36 English and nine Chinese) were included and analyzed. The specific information regarding dental radiation was evaluated. The Patient Education Material Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials was used to assess understandability and actionability.\nResults\nThere was no significant difference between the English and Chinese videos in terms of view count, like count, comment count, and video duration. Half of the videos explicitly reassured the audience that dental x-rays are safe. Two of the English videos specifically stated that dental x-rays do not cause cancers. Numerous analogies were made in regard to radiation dose, such as equivalence to taking a flight or eating some bananas. About 41.7% of the English videos and 33.3% of the Chinese videos mentioned that patients could be further protected from scatter radiation by wearing a lead apron and thyroid collar. Videos had a good understandability score (91.3) but a poor actionability score (0).\nConclusions\nSome of the analogies and the claimed radiation dose were questionable. One Chinese video even wrongly stated that dental x-rays are nonionizing radiation. The videos generally did not mention their information sources or the underlying radiation protection principles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e70929c878c28a047399193"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"205520762311790","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66308e664097071c38a3b3ab","66308e664097071c38a3b3ac","66308e664097071c38a3b3ae","66308e664097071c38a3b3af","66308e664097071c38a3b3b0","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bf2d","mniswId":"5083","title":"Digital Health","issn":"2055-2076","eissn":"2055-2076","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"43c37ca5-9b69-40ae-a660-ba448896e882"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"650c5f2a409707102d70f99d","year":"2023","volume":"9","documentHash":"4bf1f1db-2112-4552-b23e-8c432171a89d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["YouTube, radiation safety, ALARA, health, internet, media, information, quality"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059578534"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6630a1924097071c38a4bf97","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Malinowski","documentHash":"a7671417-bcf1-464d-9dc9-1dd472be874f"},{"objectId":"6630a1924097071c38a4bf96","name":"Stephan Walter","lastName":"Otto","documentHash":"2020683e-dfa0-42db-b53e-0749c6fe8965"},{"objectId":"6630a1924097071c38a4bf95","name":"Karol","lastName":"Kubiak","documentHash":"a12273b6-7190-42df-b17b-0317421fcb62"},{"objectId":"6630a1924097071c38a4bf94","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Słupski","documentHash":"beb936b9-0c64-4cb2-88f3-b6fbca4a2cb8"},{"objectId":"6630a1924097071c38a4bf93","name":"Anna","lastName":"Fajkiel-Madajczyk","documentHash":"237bd63f-cb8a-4c4e-b6f8-de25cc6af501"},{"objectId":"6630a1924097071c38a4bf92","name":"Witold","lastName":"Słomko","documentHash":"e2d5c4c0-4037-4ce2-912e-ff124eb4a1f8"},{"objectId":"6630a1924097071c38a4bf91","name":"Artur","lastName":"Kujawa","documentHash":"f5c6caf3-a258-4b76-9a01-9d71ea2ba2db"},{"objectId":"6630a1924097071c38a4bf90","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Kuźmiński","documentHash":"37f02dc7-5d26-4707-9fdf-19f8a0974f80"},{"objectId":"6630a1924097071c38a4bf8f","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wiciński","documentHash":"01a06778-5e68-4730-b3ed-c2c9b6e28c83"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a047399828","name":"Artur","lastName":"Jóżwik","uuid":"BFBE241DDF4B149570AA3703800A25F0CDE93B1C4264239BABF6DF15004F8A1C786FFD25EEBC56546FCC94E0822AD59D94E422B8D8723F693AD042AB30FBBC43","orcidId":"0000-0001-5546-9891","documentHash":"9b809847-eb52-4086-95d8-3c676abd8ef9"}],"objectId":"6630a1924097071c38a4bf8e","doi":"10.3390/biology12040531","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/12/4/531/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Does Intense Endurance Workout Have an Impact on Serum Levels of Sex Hormones in Males?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The benefits of physical activity and sports are widely known and proved to be crucial for overall health and well-being.

Proper levels of the serum concentration are necessary in order to maintain physical effectiveness. Authors analyzed the data and reviewed the former conterminous articles to find the possible mechanisms leading to changes of serum concentration of certain hormones and molecules. The direct effect of physical activity was a decrease in testosterone serum concentration (from 7.12 ± 0.4 to 6.59 ± 0.35 (ng/mL)), sex hormone binding globulin serum concentration (from 39.50 ± 2.48 to 34.27 ± 2.33 (nmol/L)), nitric oxide serum concentration (from 440.21 ± 88.64 to 432 ± 91.89 (ng/mL)), increase in estradiol serum concentration (from 78.2 ± 11.21 to 83.01 ± 13.21 (pg/mL)) and no significant increase in Apo-A1 serum concentration (from 2.63 ± 0.2 to 2.69 ± 0.21 (mg/mL)). Low testosterone concentration in OTS may be a consequence of increased conversion to estradiol, because gonadotropic stimulation is maintained. Apo-A1 serum concentration was measured due to a strong connection with testosterone level and its possible impact of decreasing cardiovascular risk."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a047399828"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"531","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6630a1924097071c38a4bf8f","6630a1924097071c38a4bf90","6630a1924097071c38a4bf91","6630a1924097071c38a4bf92","6630a1924097071c38a4bf93","6630a1924097071c38a4bf94","6630a1924097071c38a4bf95","6630a1924097071c38a4bf96","6630a1924097071c38a4bf97","5e7092a1878c28a047399828"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5d878c28514547d873","mniswId":"21252","title":"Biology","eissn":"2079-7737","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b1374be2-6fd9-4375-9a5c-b6e6f192f090"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"642a84a2409707382bf37de6","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"4","documentHash":"a8e35875-aa9a-4015-bf2b-97ae223e3811"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["testosterone; endurance training; estradiol; male; nitric oxide; SHBG"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059581675"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6630aed64097071c38a59d87","name":"J.-L.","lastName":"Rault","documentHash":"8633bef7-baae-4c07-bf01-b3f0e68221fc"},{"objectId":"6630aed64097071c38a59d86","name":"T.","lastName":"Cadman","documentHash":"50896fce-63ea-440b-8ba9-3bb0d24793f1"},{"objectId":"6630aed64097071c38a59d85","name":"K.","lastName":"Scheck","documentHash":"9e6ed03a-982e-4dd6-9191-923ff681d377"},{"objectId":"5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","name":"Irene","lastName":"Camerlink","uuid":"63511C46590F3B7E26AA60526C552EED8D9F0549F8DEE5333E681582883DA44BB38FF69E2CB85D2955FD7C17DC6CFA4F35E7BE97ABD84CE52B2422233F186398","documentHash":"21f3e447-93d1-4634-92b3-8aae9343fdc4"}],"objectId":"6630aed64097071c38a59d84","doi":"10.1016/j.animal.2023.100846","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1751731123001428?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Effects of preferential social associations on pigs’ response to weaning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Farm animals can form preferential associations within their social group. Research has shown that the presence of familiar conspecifics can help to cope with stressful situations. Nonetheless, whether the strength of the relationship matters is largely unknown. Our aim was to investigate the influence of the strength of the social relationship between familiar partners during a stressful event. Pigs (n = 116) were observed pre-weaning for their social interactions and spatial proximity with littermates. From this, preferential associations were calculated based on sociality indices of non-agonistic social behaviours (SIsoc) and spatial proximity (SIprox). Pigs were weaned into groups of unfamiliar pigs together with one littermate. The partner was selected based on the strength of their relationship pre-weaning, with pairs from across the SIsoc and SIprox distribution. SIprox and non-agonistic social behaviour (SIsoc) were included in the statistical analysis as measures of relationship strength. Focal pigs were observed postweaning for their social behaviour and spatial proximity, skin lesions and growth, and salivary cortisol concentration pre-weaning and at 4 h and 48 h postweaning. The strength of the social relationship pre-weaning did not significantly influence the behaviour or proximity towards the familiar partner postweaning, or the amount of skin lesions or weight gain. Pigs who were weaned with a littermate with whom they were strongly affiliated based on active social behaviour (SIsoc) tended to have a lower proportional increase in their cortisol concentration after weaning (P = 0.07). Pigs differed in their behaviour towards the familiar partner as compared to the unfamiliar pigs, by directing more aggression towards unfamiliar pigs (P < 0.001), and more non-agonistic social behaviours towards the familiar pig (P < 0.001). The familiar partner was on average in 12.2% of the observations the nearest neighbour, which in small groups did not differ from random choice while in large groups, this occurrence was higher than expected by chance. The results show that pigs clearly distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar pigs, but that the strength of the relationship with a familiar partner seems to have limited effects at weaning. Although preferential associations in young pigs seem weak, studies on older pigs are needed to investigate whether this is due to the relatively little time they have to establish social preferences prior to weaning."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"100846","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6630aed64097071c38a59d85","6630aed64097071c38a59d86","6630aed64097071c38a59d87","5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547702a","mniswId":"1135","title":"Animal.","issn":"1751-7311","eissn":"1751-732X","documentHash":"75e7d827-d0e7-4aaa-99e6-ce35edc7b49b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e5a27c4097076263cf9576","year":"2023","volume":"17","number":"6","documentHash":"998c001f-8b96-48d7-89e1-831004a1d501"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Familiarity; Piglet; Social behaviour; Social preferences; Sus scrofa."]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059581935"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6630959e4097071c38a3da71","name":"Kevin C.","lastName":"Chung","documentHash":"2b88aff8-56f9-4ee9-b5c3-eed3a999bcd1"},{"objectId":"6630959e4097071c38a3da70","name":"Yih-Chung","lastName":"Tham","documentHash":"dc5a6c43-52bb-42ed-aeca-d691e6b403f6"},{"objectId":"6630959e4097071c38a3da6f","name":"Tien Yin","lastName":"Wong","documentHash":"efe9a953-e847-4dc8-b34a-6cc64601a520"},{"objectId":"6630959e4097071c38a3da6e","name":"Ya Xing","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"f0d1909f-6b06-4d4c-af0f-9a378699063a"},{"objectId":"6630959e4097071c38a3da6d","name":"Josip","lastName":"Car","documentHash":"603324b8-6482-4186-b05c-23970b6162cc"},{"objectId":"6630959e4097071c38a3da6c","name":"Shenglan","lastName":"Tang","documentHash":"b778acff-191b-4123-95da-f9face998b78"},{"objectId":"6630959e4097071c38a3da6b","name":"Yue","lastName":"Qiu","documentHash":"1b214f08-2149-4e31-848f-f1d64e2a8fbf"},{"objectId":"6630959e4097071c38a3da6a","name":"Bach Xuan","lastName":"Tran","documentHash":"2e5481e4-a34d-41ea-8652-d31811fcbd36"},{"objectId":"6630959e4097071c38a3da69","name":"Kennarey","lastName":"Seang","documentHash":"980ec66b-26af-40cf-afff-b05e5427887a"},{"objectId":"6630959e4097071c38a3da68","name":"Yuchen","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"87e9dbe5-503f-4a28-aca0-0af9623e2907"},{"objectId":"6630959e4097071c38a3da67","name":"Hayley M.","lastName":"Sanders","documentHash":"d6e627a7-579f-47cd-8d4f-530519a188b1"},{"objectId":"6630959e4097071c38a3da66","name":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"5f30a0ca-5f07-427a-8e7d-042002865c28"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"6630959e4097071c38a3da65","doi":"10.1016/j.lanwpc.2023.100905","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2666606523002237?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"ChatGPT: promise and challenges for deployment in low- and middle-income countries","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the fields of medicine and public health grapple with numerous challenges that continue to hinder patients' access to healthcare services.

The partial or complete lockdown situations in the last 2 years have confined everyone in their respective territories, leading to changes in neurological complications like anxiety, depression, stress, and psychological disturbances in the general public, especially in children. It has been reported that isolation and post-traumatic stress was the leading cause of depression and altered mood in post COVID-19 patients (Rogers et al., 2020). A study showed that 78 out of 214 patients with COVID-19 developed neurological complications such as headache, dizziness and impaired consciousness (Wang et al., 2020). The synthetic drugs and pharmacological interventions currently available for treating neurological disorders are associated with severe adverse effects. Managing such disorders with natural products seems to be a viable approach.\n\nIt is the hour of need to deal with the increasing number of neurological disorders in developing and developed countries with safer and therapeutically efficacious medicines. We can achieve this goal with advanced clinical and translational research and bioinformatics tools on traditionally used and medicinally potential natural products (herbal drugs). Considering the need to enrich more information about natural products and neurological disorders, researchers and clinicians working in the Natural Products/Pharmacology field were invited to contribute their valuable research to this Research Topic article collection.

Here, we aim to highlight the inherent challenges and propose some ways to mend the gaps in the system.

CD4+ T cells are a highly heterogeneous and reprogrammable family, which includes various distinctive cell types such as Th17, Th1, and Treg cells. Interestingly Th17 and Treg cells share a related transcriptomic profile, where the TGFβ–SMADS pathway plays a fundamental role in regulating the differentiation of both of these cell types. However, Th17 could be highly pathogenic and was shown to promote inflammation in various neuropathological disorders. Conversely, Treg is anti-inflammatory and is known to inhibit Th17. It could be noticed that Th17 frequencies of infiltration of the blood–brain barrier in various neurological disorders are significantly upregulated. However, Treg infiltration numbers are significantly low. The reasons behind these contradicting observations are still unknown. In this perspective, we propose that the difference in the T-cell receptor repertoire diversity, diapedesis pathways, chemokine expression, and mechanical properties of these two cell types could be contributing to answering this intriguing question."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5e7092ae878c28a04739a77f","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e70927a878c28a047396795","5e70929c878c28a047399193"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a0473984fe"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"75","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"417-423","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6630b9c54097071c38a6942a","5e70927a878c28a047396795","5e7092ae878c28a04739a77f","5e709294878c28a0473984fe","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","612d94299543c7051ff01b28"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478061","mniswId":"8121","title":"Immunogenetics","issn":"0093-7711","eissn":"1432-1211","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c3e76247-62dd-4f52-b046-d7c90b6f2ffa"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6630b9c54097071c38a69429","year":"2023","volume":"75","number":"5","documentHash":"9fc55512-89d6-4b0f-bfca-7579277ea49e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CD4+; T cells; TCR repertoire; Th17; Treg; Paracellular; Transcellular"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059585383"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6638d00e4097076e57a97d45","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wiciński","documentHash":"a49425e0-80cc-4ee4-bc17-c859ae9d100f"},{"objectId":"6638d00e4097076e57a97d44","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Małachowska","documentHash":"f2225fb8-6d43-4741-8efc-2f86d54b8eca"},{"objectId":"6638d00e4097076e57a97d43","name":"Ewa Dorota","lastName":"Małachowska","documentHash":"73c312e5-eb46-4838-9375-435a2b1f48ab"},{"objectId":"6638d00e4097076e57a97d42","name":"Karina","lastName":"Szafrańska","documentHash":"5df86f79-8d45-4399-8009-247d257efbab"},{"objectId":"6638d00e4097076e57a97d41","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kamińska","documentHash":"4e88630c-e4f3-45b7-b998-275000d39163"},{"objectId":"6638d00e4097076e57a97d40","name":"Witold","lastName":"Słomko","documentHash":"9eefa365-e48c-4084-90d0-bbcee54a0a2a"},{"objectId":"64c9bfa940e3ff494b566a65","name":"NATALIA","lastName":"KSEPKA","uuid":"35F8D256E1AA0C391C2649CD058CD4B617315655F1A763BEEFB8E5E746596133CDF768D4A9242CE6C872F2FBBEE7D89AAB7F3BD7FCB4D2B9B1CF9DD6B8DAE2E5","documentHash":"4ebfd013-2b8c-493c-bd9c-1026fd414f61"},{"objectId":"622970b87523402df08fac76","name":"Cyprian","lastName":"Tomasik","uuid":"040B9217423B5A3482F9FF4AD47C146447F3CE2BF2BEFF84897B67CCA770A685F358AC0D98FD2A9E5D4A0EB4573AD04EFA8A0BC81E153A5428E3EB3A8DE71C21","documentHash":"55b1fb01-f04f-4e36-b8f5-f121d251ba8d"},{"objectId":"61e23fb87523403b69b37a94","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Wysocki","uuid":"31871A0208DBFEEB74DE3351A659435D14F59E22E25A8676DC41845E122A912389C55698F8B57DBFC1DD2A085068E2F32D6C1BED9A6AF63D68232B0FC97FA100","documentHash":"6ca918a5-c6bf-40c6-b472-961d70648859"},{"objectId":"5f98f237085dcb424e4c1b9c","name":"Iga","lastName":"Bartel","uuid":"D5E820C41151FCECD975218E81CA96BD0D84CB152279F8AA34A5FC4A49C1C387FDFADF9011C81D5D4D781E6B6206964D5B8A9691D8D87422BF97BB0F2A1922C0","orcidId":"0000-0002-8363-2016","documentHash":"2fc8f736-4081-4b2f-9619-a69a08083629"},{"objectId":"5f87bf6c085dcb410a25ef74","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Koszarska","uuid":"B1975463EE86FD1B5D99ABB4BAB6B8A70CEC8A7D217DF620B7B2CF77DD18E12EF7A3AF669CA73759CDC0BCBE4558E032168BB17D7416A7E931AEA5414962C804","orcidId":"0000-0002-0442-6127","documentHash":"6866275f-f278-4c4e-a3ba-ac16bd684582"}],"objectId":"6638d00e4097076e57a97d3f","doi":"10.2478/aspr-2023-0018","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/aspr-2023-0018","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Investigation of thrombogenic risk factors in young adult male sportsmen","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study aimed to check the impact of sportsmen’s physical activity on blood coagulation processes and myocardial micro injuries in young adult male sportsmen.

Due to increasing demand and the complexity of FCB’s botanical origin, various substitutes have appeared in the market, resulting in a major challenge to distinguish FCB and its substitutes (F. pallidiflorae bulbus, FPB). Therefore, discriminating FCB from FPB has becoming an urgent necessity. In this study, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–ESI–MS/MS) method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of nine steroidal alkaloids (imperialine-3-β-D-glucoside, imperialine, verticine, verticinone, peimisine, yibeinoside A, delavine, delavinone, ebeidinone) within 8 min. According to the composition and content of the above nine compounds, multivariate chemometric analyses were applied for the classification of FCB and FPB. The quantitative results showed that there were both similarities and differences in the content of nine steroidal alkaloids between FCB and FPB, and it was difficult to directly distinguish these two species. Fortunately, with the aid of chemometric analyses, FCB and FPB were successfully differentiated by partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) models based on the nine alkaloids’ content. Moreover, four compounds (yibeinoside A, ebeiedinone, delavinone and imperialine) were discovered as potential markers for the identification and differentiation of FCB and FPB. Additionally, compared to other studies, this work collected a large number of samples (49 batches of FCB and 17 batches of FPB) to ensure the reliability of the results. In conclusion, this work established a new approach for the authentication of FCB based on its active components, which provides a good reference for the quality control of FCB and will help us to understand the chemical composition differences between FCB and its adulterants further."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"75","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6638d1a54097076e57a98fc3","6638d1a54097076e57a98fc4","6638d1a54097076e57a98fc5","6638d1a54097076e57a98fc6","6638d1a54097076e57a98fc7","6638d1a54097076e57a98fc8","6638d1a54097076e57a98fc9","6638d1a54097076e57a98fca","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d2e6","mniswId":"18392","title":"Separations","issn":"2297-8739","websiteLink":"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/separations","documentHash":"7fc70515-5149-4181-bc52-b158cbde48f8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63fc958f4097074e59fce55f","year":"2023","volume":"10","number":"2","documentHash":"88f9254e-8869-4b9d-8bd6-9119579f69b9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fritillariae cirrhosae bulbus; Fritillariae pallidiflorae bulbus; steroidal alkaloids; UPLC-ESI-MS/MS; chemometric analysis; authentication"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059585485"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6638c52c4097076e57a8d383","name":"Christina R.","lastName":"Stanley","documentHash":"9b775545-adce-4b20-999c-eb4dc2878d9b"},{"objectId":"6638c52c4097076e57a8d382","name":"Léa","lastName":"Lansade","documentHash":"ceb3b87b-18db-4dbf-9211-1283f10858e3"},{"objectId":"6638c52c4097076e57a8d381","name":"Marta","lastName":"Siemieniuch","documentHash":"0ba04e89-16d9-4a6b-bb81-ee7258069373"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a047399792","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Górecka-Bruzda","uuid":"72F07386064F04FF4EAD4A68E0477EB2820848B4A1DA26E3EF48F8D21F704F6E420674366B7C4BA7D63499E807F6FA5DE0CB5CACD4982E5B9255599DE0881524","orcidId":"0000-0002-2770-2278","documentHash":"12a96cce-0775-4b1e-a45d-8a702583a7c3"}],"objectId":"6638c52c4097076e57a8d380","doi":"10.3390/ani14010008","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/14/1/8/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"How Useful Are Existing Protocols in the Quick Assessment of the Welfare of Semi-Feral Horses?

The aim of the study was to test the feasibility and usefulness of two welfare protocols that could be applied to semi-feral populations: a prototype of welfare assessment template (WAT) for Carneddau semi-feral ponies and the IFCE/INRAE Horse Welfare Protocol. Additionally, the body condition scale designed by Henneke (BCS-H) was employed. The study took place in July/August 2022 and April 2023 to evaluate the welfare of a pilot population of nineteen semi-feral Konik polski horses. The horses scored high or satisfactory under indicators across both protocols; only body condition scores were significantly lower in early spring (BCS-WAT: 1.11 ± 0.57; BCS-H: 3.84 ± 1.17) than in the summer (BCS-WAT: 1.58 ± 0.61; BCS-H: 5.63 ± 1.01). Our study confirmed the feasibility of utilising most of the WAT and IFCE/INRAE welfare indicators in semi-feral horses. Some adaptations, such as considering validation of scales, positive welfare indicators and animals’ free-choice of conditions, have been suggested for future in-field application."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a047399792"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6638c52c4097076e57a8d381","6638c52c4097076e57a8d382","6638c52c4097076e57a8d383","5e7092a1878c28a047399792"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a28f294097071218b4e5e2","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"1","documentHash":"cc0a687c-3c81-4049-8943-f71da21aa5b1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["welfare protocols; semi-feral horses; Konik polski horses"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059585567"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6630a26d4097071c38a4df43","name":"K.","lastName":"Petrie","documentHash":"6466dba7-9203-49a2-8a01-ae9ed7c30d91"},{"objectId":"6630a26d4097071c38a4df42","name":"M.

The success of ATRA in APL, however, remains to be translated to non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We previously showed that aberrant histone modifications, including histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and lysine 27 (H3K27) methylation, were associated with this lack of response and that epigenetic therapy with small molecule inhibitors of the H3K4 demethylase LSD1/KDM1A could reprogram AML cells to respond to ATRA. Serving as the enzymatic component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, EZH2/KMT6A methyltransferase plays a critical role in normal hematopoiesis by affecting the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. The canonical function of EZH2 is methylation of H3K27, although important non-canonical roles have recently been described. EZH2 mutation or deregulated expression has been conclusively demonstrated in the pathogenesis of AML and response to treatment, thus making it an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we therefore investigated whether inhibition of EZH2 might also improve the response of non-APL AML cells to ATRA-based therapy. We focused on GSK-343, a pyridone-containing S-adenosyl-L-methionine cofactor-competitive EZH2 inhibitor that is representative of its class, and HKMTI-1-005, a substrate-competitive dual inhibitor targeting EZH2 and the closely related G9A/GLP H3K9 methyltransferases. We found that treatment with HKMTI-1-005 phenocopied EZH2 knockdown and was more effective in inducing differentiation than GSK-343, despite the efficacy of GSK-343 in terms of abolishing H3K27 trimethylation. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed that in contrast to treatment with GSK-343, HKMTI-1-005 upregulated the expression of differentiation pathway genes with and without ATRA, while downregulating genes associated with a hematopoietic stem cell phenotype. These results pointed to a non-canonical role for EZH2, which was supported by the finding that EZH2 associates with the master regulator of myeloid differentiation, RARα, in an ATRA-dependent manner that was enhanced by HKMTI-1-005, possibly playing a role in co-regulator complex exchange during transcriptional activation. In summary, our results strongly suggest that addition of HKMTI-1-005 to ATRA is a new therapeutic approach against AML that warrants further investigation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f3878c28a0473c7b57"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6630a26d4097071c38a4df3b","6630a26d4097071c38a4df3c","6630a26d4097071c38a4df3d","6630a26d4097071c38a4df3e","6630a26d4097071c38a4df3f","6630a26d4097071c38a4df40","6630a26d4097071c38a4df41","6630a26d4097071c38a4df42","6630a26d4097071c38a4df43","5e7094f3878c28a0473c7b57"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcae","mniswId":"22505","title":"Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology","doi":"","issn":"2296-634X","eissn":"2296-634X","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"35539204-7182-4af6-bbce-af65c85cdf22"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"658d6f4540970713760d089d","year":"2023","volume":"11","documentHash":"d48a2e86-2437-4ef4-bf08-b05046d9e100"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["EZH2/KMT6A, G9A/EHMT2, GLP/EHMT1, differentiation, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), RARα, HKMTI-1-005"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059585616"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6630a1074097071c38a4abba","name":"Jesús","lastName":"Page","documentHash":"266e1b7a-1d14-435e-b8df-d8634928ebb1"},{"objectId":"6630a1074097071c38a4abb9","name":"Rocío","lastName":"Gómez","documentHash":"64db68cd-b7c3-4ef6-bbaf-5e7321e1aaf9"},{"objectId":"6630a1074097071c38a4abb8","name":"Aurora","lastName":"Ruiz-Herrera","documentHash":"c23f5a13-24b7-4474-af7b-57edc60c2d0e"},{"objectId":"6630a1074097071c38a4abb7","name":"Paul D.","lastName":"Waters","documentHash":"c05edea7-2a41-47dc-a57f-8a6e86bf4522"},{"objectId":"6630a1074097071c38a4abb6","name":"Raúl","lastName":"Fernández-Donoso","documentHash":"92a22a97-22f7-4e3b-aebc-f1ace5112731"},{"objectId":"6630a1074097071c38a4abb5","name":"Soledad","lastName":"Berríos","documentHash":"45c98144-a26f-499d-9ea7-9dee2b0c79f2"},{"objectId":"6630a1074097071c38a4abb4","name":"Geoff","lastName":"Shaw","documentHash":"5396e036-1723-499a-914e-a04d2b99df9c"},{"objectId":"6630a1074097071c38a4abb3","name":"Marilyn B.","lastName":"Renfree","documentHash":"8c82fbc4-c9c0-47d7-8895-6e04ef71eac1"},{"objectId":"6630a1074097071c38a4abb2","name":"Laia","lastName":"Marín-Gual","documentHash":"2693d158-6c54-4560-a38e-6e1604ea078d"},{"objectId":"6630a1074097071c38a4abb1","name":"Marta","lastName":"Martín-Ruiz","documentHash":"ad0f2a42-06d2-43ad-9e14-dacbaf8ef78c"},{"objectId":"6630a1074097071c38a4abb0","name":"María","lastName":"Valerio-de Arana","documentHash":"ffe2447d-26f0-405a-bffb-ffed20a8b196"},{"objectId":"6630a1074097071c38a4abaf","name":"Pablo","lastName":"López-Jiménez","documentHash":"f089ee30-de1d-40ca-a376-7bcb1fa5a641"},{"objectId":"6630a1074097071c38a4abae","name":"Mireia","lastName":"Solé","documentHash":"8e741911-6f52-4160-8e0c-005b72afd91d"},{"objectId":"6630a1074097071c38a4abad","name":"F.

The DNA damage response is then triggered. Although the dynamics of this response is well studied in eutherian mammals, recent findings have revealed different patterns of DNA damage signaling and repair in marsupial mammals. To better characterize these differences, here we analyzed synapsis and the chromosomal distribution of meiotic DSBs markers in three different marsupial species (Thylamys elegans, Dromiciops gliorides, and Macropus eugenii) that represent South American and Australian Orders. Our results revealed inter-specific differences in the chromosomal distribution of DNA damage and repair proteins, which were associated with differing synapsis patterns. In the American species T. elegans and D. gliroides, chromosomal ends were conspicuously polarized in a bouquet configuration and synapsis progressed exclusively from the telomeres towards interstitial regions. This was accompanied by sparse H2AX phosphorylation, mainly accumulating at chromosomal ends. Accordingly, RAD51 and RPA were mainly localized at chromosomal ends throughout prophase I in both American marsupials, likely resulting in reduced recombination rates at interstitial positions. In sharp contrast, synapsis initiated at both interstitial and distal chromosomal regions in the Australian representative M. eugenii, the bouquet polarization was incomplete and ephemeral, γH2AX had a broad nuclear distribution, and RAD51 and RPA foci displayed an even chromosomal distribution. Given the basal evolutionary position of T. elegans, it is likely that the meiotic features reported in this species represent an ancestral pattern in marsupials and that a shift in the meiotic program occurred after the split of D. gliroides and the Australian marsupial clade. Our results open intriguing questions about the regulation and homeostasis of meiotic DSBs in marsupials. The low recombination rates observed at the interstitial chromosomal regions in American marsupials can result in the formation of large linkage groups, thus having an impact in the evolution of their genomes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["612d94299543c7051ff01b22"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6630a1074097071c38a4abad","6630a1074097071c38a4abae","6630a1074097071c38a4abaf","6630a1074097071c38a4abb0","6630a1074097071c38a4abb1","6630a1074097071c38a4abb2","6630a1074097071c38a4abb3","6630a1074097071c38a4abb4","6630a1074097071c38a4abb5","6630a1074097071c38a4abb6","6630a1074097071c38a4abb7","6630a1074097071c38a4abb8","6630a1074097071c38a4abb9","6630a1074097071c38a4abba","612d94299543c7051ff01b22"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcae","mniswId":"22505","title":"Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology","doi":"","issn":"2296-634X","eissn":"2296-634X","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"35539204-7182-4af6-bbce-af65c85cdf22"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"658d6f4540970713760d089d","year":"2023","volume":"11","documentHash":"d48a2e86-2437-4ef4-bf08-b05046d9e100"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["marsupial, meiosis, evolution, synapsis, recombination, Thylamys, Dromiciops, Macropus"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059585648"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6638bdbd4097076e57a87eec","name":"Guowei","lastName":"Shu","documentHash":"3d43cc07-61cb-427f-89f0-7c3f6eba9825"},{"objectId":"6638bdbd4097076e57a87eeb","name":"He","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"375c8f4b-f4be-47b7-ab2b-92032d84d061"},{"objectId":"633e3da97523402e340f9cea","name":"Li","lastName":"Chen","uuid":"DA6D944797DD85D567FAAF68136D03D1DA2A57DAE89A267ADAA626C6C5FB657C54C0AD48252F51747B871248C3569F1B2C22B9B98BDFF5FEBB29FE0918CA4FAC","documentHash":"c888f9d4-f822-4958-8928-be3e448bbecf"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a04739966f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Bagnicka","uuid":"0D37A8BCF2F4D93F59FC1D87DBDADCE868EF14AFD99EBF96C877CC86963C73AE2E470CED6B83A3F731B3B08724BDCE11D9A8CE8A0CE7E36513995F6A5C4D000D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7193-2006","documentHash":"a42098e0-b6d5-4d75-b67b-2d9b112c9c92"}],"objectId":"6638bdbd4097076e57a87eea","doi":"10.1039/d3fo00413a","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2023/FO/D3FO00413A","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Health potential of fermented goat dairy products: composition comparison with fermented cow milk, probiotics selection, health benefits and mechanisms","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Goat milk as a preferable probiotic vehicle has been investigated and the contribution of fermented goat dairy products to the nutritional and economic wellbeing of the world is tremendous. This review presents the recent progress on fermented goat dairy products, including probiotic selection, composition comparison to fermented cow milk, health effects, and related mechanisms. Fermented goat milk maintains a better nutritional profile in comparison to fermented cow milk with higher values of protein, minerals (Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn and Se), vitamins (A, D3 and B12) and some fatty acids. Lactobacillus is the predominant genus used in goat milk fermentation and endows goat milk with higher functional value, including gut microbiota regulation, anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory functions, hypocholesterolemic effects, antioxidant effects, hypotensive effects, bone health, anemia recovery, anti-obesity, and anti-atherogenic function. The corresponding mechanisms have been elucidated at the molecular level. A series of collection on probiotics starters, fermentation strategy and characteristics of fermented goat dairy products are performed.

The aim of the work was a bibliometric analysis of clinical studies of digital pills and an assessment of the level of evidence of their\neffectiveness, safety, and prospects for the future.\nMaterials and Methods: The studies were conducted using online databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov, Dimensions, and Web of Science for the period January 2012 to July 2022. The VOSviewer tool for building and visualizing bibliometric networks\nwas used.\nResults: Bibliometric analysis of the scientific literature revealed that over the past 10 years, the number of publications about digital pills has noticeably increased, which indicates the increasing importance of this field of knowledge. The leading positions in this area are occupied by scientists from the United States, the United Kingdom, and India. Sources of financial support for authors of publications in the field of digital pills are funds from leading developer companies, budget allocations, and funds from non-commercial organizations. Public-private partnerships are an important path to develop and implement digital pills. The four main clusters of digital pill studies were highlighted and visualized: efficacy and safety analysis for serious mental disorders; treatment and costs of tuberculosis therapy; features of the treatment of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and AIDS; and usage monitoring. Available publications demonstrate the efficacy potential and safety of digital pills. Nevertheless, the effects of digital pills have not yet been fully studied.\nConclusion: Priority areas for future research are further randomized controlled clinical trials and meta-analyses, which are necessary for a high level (I level) of evidence for therapeutic applications of digital pills, as well as pharmacoeconomic\nstudies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663091564097071c38a3c78a","663091564097071c38a3c78b","663091564097071c38a3c78c","663091564097071c38a3c78d","663091564097071c38a3c78e","663091564097071c38a3c78f","663091564097071c38a3c790","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d68","mniswId":"6860","title":"Frontiers in Pharmacology","doi":"","issn":"1663-9812","eissn":"1663-9812","websiteLink":"http://www.frontiersin.org/Pharmacology","documentHash":"0c526fb7-3556-47c9-918a-affeaac4e1bc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63e20088409707409b7b1a2c","year":"2023","volume":"14","documentHash":"c8141cfc-24da-40c2-90f0-d6557b0a9b7b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["digital pill, ingestible sensor, efficiency, safety, medication adherence, clinical trials"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059585775"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6630be614097071c38a6f480","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Diecke","documentHash":"27ded603-8d7e-4e73-b447-98ed4ff4ecaf"},{"objectId":"6630be614097071c38a6f47f","name":"Alessandro","lastName":"Prigione","documentHash":"40435d0f-0fe8-4764-abce-4138b686e82b"},{"objectId":"6630be614097071c38a6f47e","name":"Josef","lastName":"Priller","documentHash":"3c9aab6e-02c9-4b90-8612-9e9269fa81b9"},{"objectId":"6630be614097071c38a6f47d","name":"Erich E.","lastName":"Wanker","documentHash":"467c9de4-fd64-47d9-a810-d689d8fd6505"},{"objectId":"6630be614097071c38a6f47c","name":"Carolin","lastName":"Genehr","documentHash":"b12206d8-c2df-4166-9900-a7c0136a9829"},{"objectId":"6630be614097071c38a6f47b","name":"Duncan C.","lastName":"Miller","documentHash":"f88e1393-a0a5-4194-b3c5-b2c42d2ea81b"},{"objectId":"5e7092b0878c28a04739abad","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Lisowski","uuid":"28B515A985372713BCEF4B16FC54C00181E04448CBAF00EC703A81AEDCE112E772310F3D4545F83DFBCD0E886E9F08C66F2AF00EF052C8F198753BE1F7E01A7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3634-1072","documentHash":"bf6a35c7-926d-4db5-9470-f4ad44cbabd0"}],"objectId":"6630be614097071c38a6f479","doi":"10.1016/j.scr.2023.103056","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1873506123000429?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Generation of an induced pluripotent stem cell line from a Huntington’s disease patient with a long HTT-PolyQ sequence","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal length of CAG repeats in the gene HTT, leading to an elongated poly-glutamine (poly-Q) sequence in huntingtin (HTT).

NT exerts its neurophysiological effects by interactions with the human NT receptors type 1 (hNTS1) and 2 (hNTS2). Therefore, both receptor subtypes are promising targets for the development of novel NT-based analogs for the treatment of PD. In this study, we used a virtually guided molecular modeling approach to predict the activity of NT(8–13) analogs by investigating the docking models of ligands designed for binding to the human NTS1 and NTS2 receptors. The importance of the residues at positions 8 and/or 9 for hNTS1 and hNTS2 receptor binding affinity was experimentally confirmed by radioligand binding assays. Further in vitro ADME profiling and in vivo studies revealed that, compared to the parent peptide NT(8–13), compound 10 exhibited improved stability and BBB permeability combined with a significant enhancement of the motor function and memory in a mouse model of PD. The herein reported NTS1/NTS2 dual-specific NT(8–13) analogs represent an attractive tool for the development of therapeutic strategies against PD and potentially other CNS disorders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"254","pagesFromTo":"115386","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663a10bb4097077c1aaa77db","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77dc","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77dd","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77de","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77df","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77e0","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77e1","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77e2","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77e3","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77e4","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77e5","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77e6","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77e7","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77e8","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77e9","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77ea","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77eb","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77ec","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77ed","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77ee","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77ef","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77f0","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77f1","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77f2","663a10bb4097077c1aaa77f3","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477bcb","mniswId":"6215","title":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","issn":"0223-5234","documentHash":"74c625c5-b100-414f-8e60-02d89f6f1796"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"663a10bb4097077c1aaa77da","year":"2023","volume":"254","documentHash":"568c2e07-ba82-4556-a003-d54e05240317"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Neurotensin; Peptide analogs; Agonists; Neurotensin receptors; Parkinson's disease"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059592171"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094c5878c28a0473c35de","name":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Taniguchi","uuid":"2A0CFA9A6B89CB3CEE777F6F29214022AA2419D8BBE1FF66B80CE36A84BCB2DAE93CEBE3F7258D0DD97DB84D6A83C7505E1F7080FBD9BCC6908DB71E44B02055","orcidId":"0000-0001-7270-390X","documentHash":"5b3a159e-86a4-4b30-accc-523bf3563bab"}],"objectId":"6638d2c24097076e57a997ef","doi":"10.3390/ijms242417275","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/24/17275/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Liver Cancer 2.0","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a major global health concern due to its high prevalence in many countries [1].

Tweets can be posted with text messages, images, hyperlinks, or a combination of these features. Importantly, for the majority of users, the text must be limited to 280 characters. In this perspective, this study aimed to observe if adding an image is able to increase outreach for scientific communication on X. Therefore, the characteristics of tweets posted with the hashtag #SciComm (short for science communication) for a period of one year (28 May 2020 to 28 May 2021) were analyzed with the X analytics tool Symplur Signals. The conducted analysis revealed that when a science communication (#SciComm-containing) tweet is accompanied by an image added by the user, there is on average a 529% increase in the number of retweets, and adding a hyperlink is similarly effective in increasing the number of retweets. However, combining both an image and hyperlink in the same tweet did not yield an additive effect. Hence, for increased visibility, researchers may consider adding images or hyperlinks (e.g., to research publications or popular science articles) while communicating science to the public on X."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"28-34","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663b38dd4097070c4ce1bd02","663b38dd4097070c4ce1bd03","663b38dd4097070c4ce1bd04","663b38dd4097070c4ce1bd05","663b38dd4097070c4ce1bd06","663b38dd4097070c4ce1bd07","663b38dd4097070c4ce1bd08","663b38dd4097070c4ce1bd09","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"6630b8724097071c38a68480","title":"Exploration of Digital Health Technologies","eissn":"2996-9409","websiteLink":"https://www.explorationpub.com/Journals/edht","documentHash":"84e6b942-3db3-48aa-a4e2-787dc8af9d11"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6630b8724097071c38a68481","year":"2023","volume":"1","number":"1","doi":"10.37349/edht.2023.00001","documentHash":"cce5112e-95e8-4410-8c55-3c681b06d567"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Social media, science communication, social media research"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059592376"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6638cc434097076e57a946d6","name":"Susanne","lastName":"Greber-Platzer","documentHash":"e47bfd1c-2921-4dc6-9aac-490cfaf28a94"},{"objectId":"6638cc434097076e57a946d5","name":"Chryssa","lastName":"Grylli","documentHash":"cc557cb8-a3c0-4ab7-9d81-673cd6a6880a"},{"objectId":"6638cc434097076e57a946d4","name":"Eva Anna","lastName":"Mora-Theuer","documentHash":"4d56a263-cb87-4922-b915-8385af15d34a"},{"objectId":"6638cc434097076e57a946d3","name":"Sophie","lastName":"Klomfar","documentHash":"f2a690e0-947b-4e9d-9b53-055d2ef1d524"},{"objectId":"6638cc434097076e57a946d2","name":"Mark","lastName":"Mussner","documentHash":"571a4874-d40f-4343-bfe3-1bd5c965625f"},{"objectId":"6638cc434097076e57a946d1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Eitenberger","documentHash":"cfb73880-1c1d-4cbe-9a47-d0e6aa7f415f"},{"objectId":"6638cc434097076e57a946d0","name":"Laura","lastName":"Fischer","documentHash":"f7f6c6fd-420a-47d9-8188-1b966d4f873e"},{"objectId":"6638cc434097076e57a946cf","name":"Sabine","lastName":"Völkl-Kernstock","documentHash":"9fe49cbe-f035-4669-be92-c44165d461dc"},{"objectId":"6638cc434097076e57a946ce","name":"Klara","lastName":"Doppler","documentHash":"a0353281-7b83-4404-a362-b3458a1e7108"},{"objectId":"6638cc434097076e57a946cd","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kletečka-Pulker","documentHash":"9cc38860-bf39-4759-880c-4f18dbe85a0e"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"6638cc434097076e57a946cb","doi":"10.1007/s00414-023-03094-y","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00414-023-03094-y.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Influence of various factors on the legal outcome of cases of child abuse—experiences gathered at an interdisciplinary forensic examination center in Vienna, Austria","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background and objective\nTo improve the currently low conviction rate in cases of child abuse a forensic examination center for children and adolescents (FOKUS) was established in Vienna, Austria.

This arena has grown into a rich data source for public health observation and understanding key trends in healthcare on a global scale. In the field of mental health in particular, it would be of benefit to understand and report the key stakeholders' (individual mental health professionals, academic organizations and their countries) trends and patterns of psychiatric knowledge and information dissemination using #PsychTwitter.\n\nObjective: In this study, we aim to evaluate the achieved outreach of psychiatry-related tweets using the hashtag #PsychTwitter.\n\nMethods: We utilized the Symplur Signals research analytics tool to characterize tweets containing #PsychTwitter from the 20th of August, 2019, to the 20th of August, 2022.\n\nResults: The #PsychTwitter movement resulted in 125,297 tweets that were shared by 40,058 Twitter users and generated a total of 492,565,230 impressions (views). The three largest identified groups of contributors were Doctors (13.8% of all tweets), Org. Advocacy (6.2% of all tweets), and Researcher/Academic (4% of all tweets) stakeholders. The top influential accounts consisted of 55 psychiatrists and 16 institutional or organizational accounts. The top 5 countries from where most of the tweets containing #PsychTwitter were shared include the United States (54.3% of all users), the United Kingdom (10.4% of all users), Canada (4.9% of all users), India (2% of all users), and Australia (1.8% of all users).\n\nConclusion: This is the first of its kind study featuring the influence and usage of #PsychTwitter and covering its global impact in the field of psychiatry using the Twitter platform.

Therefore, a better understanding of key protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system is critical for effective prevention and treatment of those disorders. The proteasome expression is tightly regulated by a CNC (cap'n'collar) family of transcription factors, amongst which the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-like bZIP factor 1 (NFE2L1, also known as Nrf1, with its long isoform TCF11 and short isoform LCR-F1) has been identified as an indispensable regulator of the transcriptional expression of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, much less is known about how the pivotal role of NFE2L1/Nrf1, as compared to its homologous NFE2L2 (also called Nrf2), is translated to its physiological and pathophysiological functions in the nervous system insomuch as to yield its proper cytoprotective effects against neurodegenerative diseases. The potential of NFE2L1 to fulfill its unique neuronal function to serve as a novel therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases is explored by evaluating the hitherto established preclinical and clinical studies of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In this review, we have also showcased a group of currently available activators of NFE2L1, along with an additional putative requirement of this CNC-bZIP factor for healthy longevity based on the experimental evidence obtained from its orthologous SKN1-A in Caenorhabditis elegans."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c5878c28a0473c35de","60c34c669543c723365443f0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"69","pagesFromTo":"103003","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663a13f44097077c1aaae802","663a13f44097077c1aaae803","663a13f44097077c1aaae804","60c34c669543c723365443f0","5e7094c5878c28a0473c35de"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794e0","mniswId":"17086","title":"Redox Biology","issn":"2213-2317","eissn":"2213-2317","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"51f7519a-e636-4c94-94a2-506246f1a64d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"663a13f44097077c1aaae801","year":"2024","volume":"69","documentHash":"95013b57-0ff5-424f-9244-f796d50943e9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CNC; NFE2L1(Nrf1); NFE2L2(Nrf2); Neuroprotection; SKN-1; neurodegenerative diseases"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059592616"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663c7fe64097071b7582531a","name":"Gareth","lastName":"Arnott","documentHash":"40277126-2288-4deb-9238-a88ee68e3402"},{"objectId":"663c7fe64097071b75825319","name":"J.

The aim of this study was to investigate third-party interference, with the predictions that (1) the interferer derives benefits from its action by winning a fight, (2) that patterns of intervention depend on familiarity, (3) that dyadic fights last longer than triadic fights, and (4) that interferers engage in non-agonistic social behaviours afterwards. Pre-pubertal pigs (Sus scrofa) (n = 384) were grouped with one familiar and four unfamiliar conspecifics (all non-kin) to elicit contests for dominance rank. Third-party interference was analysed for the first 30 min after grouping, along with the behaviour (nosing or aggression), contest duration, contest outcome, and interferer behaviour after the fight (post-conflict social behaviour).\nResults\nThree types of interference were observed: non-agonistic involvement (nose contact) by the interferer in a dyadic fight; a triadic fight with each of three contestants fighting one opponent at a time; and triadic fights with two opponents jointly attacking the third one (two-against-one fights). The likelihood of a third-party intervention to occur did not depend on the presence of a familiar animal in the fight. However, once intervention was triggered, interferers attacked unfamiliar fight initiators more than familiar ones. Two-against-one fights lasted longer than other triadic fights and occurred more often when both initial contestants were females. Results of 110 triadic fights (out of 585 fights in total) revealed that interferers were more likely to win compared to the initial opponents at equal body weight. The most common post-conflict behaviour displayed by the interferer was agonistic behaviour towards another group member, independently of familiarity.\nConclusions\nThe general lack of discrimination for familiarity suggests interference is not driven by support to familiar individuals in pigs. The results show that intervening in an ongoing fight gives the interferer a high chance of contest success and may be a strategy that is beneficial to the interferer to increase its dominance status."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663c7fe64097071b75825317","663c7fe64097071b75825318","663c7fe64097071b75825319","663c7fe64097071b7582531a","5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d6c","mniswId":"6870","title":"Frontiers in Zoology","issn":"1742-9994","eissn":"1742-9994","documentHash":"d9603e60-512c-4bef-ad86-67b270d2c2fb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"642eb41a40970751b0182778","year":"2023","volume":"20","number":"1","documentHash":"905f0516-4e15-40aa-bc44-c4798d3fb83c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Animal contest; Aggression; Coalition formation; Conflict resolution; Social behaviour; Social support theory; Third party interaction"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059592624"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6638c9224097076e57a8f5be","name":"Laura A","lastName":"Boyle","documentHash":"adec8dd6-4877-4711-aa49-c5c1f483bb0c"},{"objectId":"6638c9224097076e57a8f5bd","name":"Maria C","lastName":"Galli","documentHash":"70e5c1a9-aed0-4c35-ade3-bd989199b286"},{"objectId":"6638c9224097076e57a8f5bc","name":"Keelin","lastName":"O’Driscoll","documentHash":"8dcab51e-a0c0-463a-8881-02bf597f86a2"},{"objectId":"6638c9224097076e57a8f5bb","name":"Martyna E","lastName":"Lagoda","documentHash":"91001f7b-0307-4384-a5da-c21bb677903a"},{"objectId":"5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Marchewka","uuid":"EC0F04392DD656A21DC052B59B1A2D8E5A03749BA0461B4AFF6E8CCF5C15DE33EA901A402324204CF8155923E33B80BE4DC420B7AA2054A864B93FC416AA4F24","orcidId":"0000-0002-9571-8677","documentHash":"77dd006d-9494-445c-b9e3-36c4addbec89"}],"objectId":"6638c9224097076e57a8f5b9","doi":"10.1017/awf.2023.47","publicUri":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0962728623000477","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Indicators of improved gestation housing of sows.

We compared a typical gestation system (CONTROL) with an IMPROVED one as regards oral stereotypies, aggressive behaviour, skin lesions, locomotion, and tear staining. Sows were mixed into 12 stable groups (six groups per treatment, 20 sows per group), 29 days post-service in pens with free-access, full-length individual feeding/lying stalls. CONTROL pens had fully slatted concrete floors, with two blocks of wood and two chains suspended in the group area. IMPROVED pens were the same but with rubber mats and a length of manila rope in each feeding stall, and straw provided in three racks in the group area. Direct observations of oral stereotypical (30 instantaneous scans per sow per day) and aggressive (all-occurrence sampling, 3 h per sow per day) behaviours were conducted 72 h post-mixing, in mid and late gestation. Skin lesions were counted 24 h and three weeks post-mixing, and in late gestation. Sows’ locomotion (locomotory ability) was scored using a visual analogue scale in mid and late gestation. Right and left eye tear staining was scored in late gestation. Indications of better welfare in IMPROVED sows included performance of fewer oral stereotypies in mid and late gestation, and lower tear stain scores. These sows performed more aggression in late gestation, which was associated with access to enrichment, but skin lesion counts were not affected. Thus, the changes made in the IMPROVED treatment benefitted aspects of sow welfare."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6638c9224097076e57a8f5bb","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6638c9224097076e57a8f5bb","6638c9224097076e57a8f5bc","6638c9224097076e57a8f5bd","6638c9224097076e57a8f5be","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547703b","mniswId":"1153","title":"Animal Welfare","issn":"0962-7286","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"3ca7fd69-8126-445f-8521-af30d727bf59"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6638c9224097076e57a8f5ba","year":"2023","volume":"32","documentHash":"cc083684-aa4b-4b91-b460-43970385cdce"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["animal welfare; pig; rope; rubber; straw; chronic stress"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059592635"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663c7a1e4097071b75820cc4","name":"Christina R.","lastName":"Stanley","documentHash":"a8602bcb-d809-4969-af46-723a8897d1e1"},{"objectId":"663c7a1e4097071b75820cc3","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Jaworska","documentHash":"542eeb49-0f1b-4b49-bd53-17df03aeab95"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a047399792","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Górecka-Bruzda","uuid":"72F07386064F04FF4EAD4A68E0477EB2820848B4A1DA26E3EF48F8D21F704F6E420674366B7C4BA7D63499E807F6FA5DE0CB5CACD4982E5B9255599DE0881524","orcidId":"0000-0002-2770-2278","documentHash":"12a96cce-0775-4b1e-a45d-8a702583a7c3"}],"objectId":"663c7a1e4097071b75820cc2","doi":"10.3390/ani13071151","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/7/1151/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Social and Reproductive Challenges Faced by Free-Roaming Horse (Equus caballus) Stallions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In captivity, intact male horses, due to their sexual drive, are usually socially isolated from other horses. This lifestyle strongly contrasts with that experienced by horses living in free-roaming, feral, or semi-feral conditions, where adult stallions have several roles in their social group, with successful reproduction being their primary drive. Reproductive skew in wild populations is high; many stallions will fail to reproduce at all, while others achieve high levels of reproductive success, siring a large number of foals. Successful stallions are those with particular characteristics and abilities that facilitate harem formation and tenure, allowing them to successfully take over a harem or establish a new one, protect mares from rival stallions, employ appropriate social behaviour to maintain group cohesion, and avoid kin-mating, for example through kin recognition mechanisms. Whilst the life of free-living stallions is far from stress-free, they retain ancestral adaptations to selection pressures (such as predation and competition) exhibited by their natural environment over thousands of years. Here, we discuss the challenges faced by free-living horse stallions, the roles they play in social groups, and their resulting social needs. By understanding these pressures and how stallions react to them, we highlighted the importance of the social environment for the stallion. It is hoped that a better understanding of wild stallions’ lives will lead to their needs being more clearly met in captivity, reducing stereotypical behaviour and improving welfare."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a047399792"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1151","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663c7a1e4097071b75820cc3","663c7a1e4097071b75820cc4","5e7092a1878c28a047399792"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"642d38dd40970741c6965029","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"7","documentHash":"5bfd63a3-a934-4f86-968a-aa02fdb6fcc5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["stallions; welfare; behaviour; reproduction; free-roaming; social behaviour"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059592678"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6639f2c14097077c1aa4e6af","name":"Amélia M.","lastName":"Silva","documentHash":"617baae8-1f1f-4cce-96fd-c633e9c8a8f9"},{"objectId":"6639f2c14097077c1aa4e6ae","name":"Massimo","lastName":"Lucarini","documentHash":"2f411d5f-5a84-45d4-b80e-db1a9f73bb3c"},{"objectId":"6639f2c14097077c1aa4e6ad","name":"Alessandra","lastName":"Durazzo","documentHash":"0113c4a7-b7f5-4933-826c-bede2e8ac9a3"},{"objectId":"6639f2c14097077c1aa4e6ac","name":"Isabel R.","lastName":"Dias","documentHash":"765a6d17-0469-4714-9da0-22bd494da692"},{"objectId":"6639f2c14097077c1aa4e6ab","name":"Tatiana","lastName":"Andreani","documentHash":"8f8a982c-1fec-4859-b3ef-757d2ba7af61"},{"objectId":"6639f2c14097077c1aa4e6aa","name":"Priscila G.","lastName":"Mazzola","documentHash":"dc0eb811-38bf-4b85-94a2-745044fb374d"},{"objectId":"6639f2c14097077c1aa4e6a9","name":"Ana R.","lastName":"Fernandes","documentHash":"307c72fb-dc20-44c5-ae0c-5efc307291de"},{"objectId":"6639f2c14097077c1aa4e6a8","name":"Joana R.","lastName":"Campos","documentHash":"ffb4bd92-4aba-4384-bd77-e0bfe1905c3d"},{"objectId":"6639f2c14097077c1aa4e6a7","name":"Iara","lastName":"Baldim","documentHash":"d6ef12f9-6889-4f10-ae5d-063c2cf6c694"},{"objectId":"6639f2c14097077c1aa4e6a6","name":"Catarina I.","lastName":"Barbosa","documentHash":"131548b0-4154-4c8d-ab58-abd77f5678d5"},{"objectId":"6639f2c14097077c1aa4e6a5","name":"Antonello","lastName":"Santini","documentHash":"3418ffd1-99ff-47e6-baf7-45467ad2a445"},{"objectId":"6639f2c14097077c1aa4e6a4","name":"Eliana B.","lastName":"Souto","documentHash":"92f4103d-69e8-4795-a21f-17c5feafbd82"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"6639f2c14097077c1aa4e6a2","doi":"10.2174/1573407218666220404110837","publicUri":"https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/download?doi=10.2174/1573407218666220404110837","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Modified Drug Delivery Systems for Veterinary Use: Pharmaceutical Development and Applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Scientific research in the field of veterinary pharmacology has provided new opportunities for the development of modified release dosage forms, with the aim to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce animal stress.

The mean gestational age at the first visit and delivery was 12.8 ± 2.72 weeks and 39 ± 1.65 weeks, respectively. Hemoglobin (9.3 ± 0.9 g/dl) and ferritin (15.4(0.8-28.3) ng/ml) levels at delivery were significantly decreased in IDA as compared to controls. The fetal hemoglobin and ferritin levels were in the normal range in both groups. There was no correlation between maternal and cord blood hepcidin with fetal iron status in IDA. We further analyzed the expression of iron transport genes in the placenta of controls and the IDA group. Under maternal iron insufficiency, the expression of placental iron transporters DMT1, FPN1, and GDF15 was upregulated at the protein level. In IDA, placental GDF15 and ferroportin protein had an association with fetal iron status. These findings confirm that placental iron traffickers respond to maternal iron deficiency by increasing their expression and allowing sufficient iron to pass to the fetus."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a8878c28a04739a089"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"99","pagesFromTo":"102727","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6638c7ce4097076e57a8e754","6638c7ce4097076e57a8e755","6638c7ce4097076e57a8e756","6638c7ce4097076e57a8e757","6638c7ce4097076e57a8e758","6638c7ce4097076e57a8e759","5e7092a8878c28a04739a089"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773b3","mniswId":"2587","title":"BLOOD CELLS MOLECULES AND DISEASES","issn":"1079-9796","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"878102ee-60cd-4d09-b681-524e7a2277a8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6638c7ce4097076e57a8e753","year":"2023","volume":"99","documentHash":"4f547acd-d9f3-4f60-a531-300bdbe3ebca"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Iron deficiency anemia; Iron regulators; Placenta; Pregnancy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059592842"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6639ee784097077c1aa43507","name":"Ioana","lastName":"Berindan-Neagoe","documentHash":"22a9a4d2-9a31-492f-a82b-4dc68a8fef65"},{"objectId":"6639ee784097077c1aa43506","name":"Radu","lastName":"Pirlog","documentHash":"4f6407d7-61b0-45ac-a968-ed6cc49048db"},{"objectId":"6639ee784097077c1aa43505","name":"Liviuta","lastName":"Budisan","documentHash":"9b6f4554-f846-4e0a-8386-b4a1ebb85772"},{"objectId":"6639ee784097077c1aa43504","name":"Andreea","lastName":"Nutu","documentHash":"dda2b9cd-1884-471a-b26e-c4624d321ea9"},{"objectId":"6639ee784097077c1aa43503","name":"Oana","lastName":"Zanoaga","documentHash":"50d559fb-6ac1-4471-949d-3fcb809d7265"},{"objectId":"6639ee784097077c1aa43502","name":"Paul","lastName":"Chiroi","documentHash":"5918d66e-eaed-4573-b9b5-9fbc0c6b0fa9"},{"objectId":"6639ee784097077c1aa43501","name":"Ecaterina","lastName":"Isacescu","documentHash":"42a31405-d262-4af1-9da3-71201783e792"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"6639ee784097077c1aa43500","doi":"10.3390/antiox12020407","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/2/407/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Melanoma Cellular Signaling Transduction Pathways Targeted by Polyphenols Action Mechanisms","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer. Although different anti-melanoma treatments are available, their efficacy is still improvable, and the number of deaths continues to increase worldwide. A promising source of antitumor agents could be presented by polyphenols—natural plant-based compounds. Over the past decades, many studies have described multiple anticancer effects of polyphenols in melanoma, presenting their potential interactions with targeted molecules from different signaling pathways. However, to our knowledge, there is no comprehensive review on polyphenols-regulated mechanisms in melanoma cells available in the literature. To fulfill this gap, this article aims to summarize the current knowledge of molecular mechanisms of action regulated by polyphenols involved in melanoma initiation and progression. Here, we focus on in vitro and in vivo effects of polyphenol treatments on tumor-essential cellular pathways, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, inflammation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Moreover, emerging studies regarding the well-marked role of polyphenols in the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs), highlighting their contribution to melanoma development, are also epitomized. Finally, we hope this review will provide a firm basis for developing polyphenol-based therapeutic agents in melanoma treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"407","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6639ee784097077c1aa43501","6639ee784097077c1aa43502","6639ee784097077c1aa43503","6639ee784097077c1aa43504","6639ee784097077c1aa43505","6639ee784097077c1aa43506","6639ee784097077c1aa43507","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b9c0","mniswId":"1366","title":"Antioxidants","issn":"2076-3921","eissn":"2076-3921","documentHash":"7901f3dc-def7-44a9-b732-047dbd3dcf82"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63dba2ca4097072584204052","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"2","documentHash":"b8dec610-7ca4-491a-973f-1b403f012dfb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["malignant melanoma; polyphenols; cellular pathways; signaling; cancer treatment; melanoma initiation; melanoma progression; microRNAs"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059592939"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663b2b234097070c4cdfcb4f","name":"Harald","lastName":"Willschke","documentHash":"a48225e1-f953-4bf6-a6a7-fefadc0a8e17"},{"objectId":"663b2b234097070c4cdfcb4e","name":"Oliver","lastName":"Kimberger","documentHash":"d0b95fa2-f9bc-4c39-8e51-442218fa07b7"},{"objectId":"663b2b234097070c4cdfcb4d","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kletecka-Pulker","documentHash":"47b59e1e-60d0-4473-9ff7-76b0bae8cdd7"},{"objectId":"663b2b234097070c4cdfcb4c","name":"Josef","lastName":"Niebauer","documentHash":"c75a9071-7295-42ac-9244-ca743523eda2"},{"objectId":"663b2b234097070c4cdfcb4b","name":"Emil D.","lastName":"Parvanov","documentHash":"bcd96644-604f-479e-b76b-677896bd3d51"},{"objectId":"663b2b234097070c4cdfcb4a","name":"Aylin","lastName":"Bilir","documentHash":"cd291b7f-8701-4842-b5c9-733c047d3411"},{"objectId":"663b2b234097070c4cdfcb49","name":"Olena","lastName":"Litvinova","documentHash":"6811b62e-cd3b-42a0-95ff-fccc0100064e"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"663b2b234097070c4cdfcb48","doi":"10.3389/fmed.2023.1138051","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2023.1138051/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Patent landscape review of non-invasive medical sensors for continuous monitoring of blood pressure and their validation in critical care practice","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objectives: Continuous non-invasive monitoring of blood pressure is one of the main factors in ensuring the safety of the patient’s condition in anesthesiology, intensive care, surgery, and other areas of medicine. The purpose of this work was to analyze the current patent situation and identify directions and trends in the application of non-invasive medical sensors for continuous blood pressure monitoring, with a focus on clinical experience in critical care and validation thereof.\nMaterials and methods: The research results reflect data collected up to September 30, 2022. Patent databases, Google Scholar, the Lens database, Pubmed, Scopus databases were used to search for patent and clinical information.\nResults: An analysis of the patent landscape indicates a significant increase in interest in the development of non-invasive devices for continuous blood pressure monitoring and their implementation in medical practice, especially in the last 10 years. The key players in the intellectual property market are the following companies: Cnsystems Medizintechnik; Sotera Wireless INC; Tensys Medical INC; Healthstats Int Pte LTD; Edwards Lifesciences Corp, among others. Systematization of data from validation and clinical studies in critical care practice on patients with various pathological conditions and ages, including children and newborns, revealed that a number of non-invasive medical sensor technologies are quite accurate and comparable to the “gold standard” continuous invasive blood pressure monitoring. They are approved by the FDA for medical applications and certified according to ISO 81060-2, ISO 81060-3, and ISO/TS 81060-5. Unregistered and uncertified medical sensors require further clinical trials.\nConclusion: Non-invasive medical sensors for continuous blood pressure monitoring do not replace, but complement, existing methods of regular blood pressure measurement, and it is expected to see more of these technologies broadly implemented in the practice in the near future."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663b2b234097070c4cdfcb49","663b2b234097070c4cdfcb4a","663b2b234097070c4cdfcb4b","663b2b234097070c4cdfcb4c","663b2b234097070c4cdfcb4d","663b2b234097070c4cdfcb4e","663b2b234097070c4cdfcb4f","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1b2","mniswId":"6847","title":"Frontiers in Medicine","issn":"2296-858X","eissn":"2296-858X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"6c827de0-68f7-433c-bd4c-6f332f60833e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"640058104097072cdeca1855","year":"2023","volume":"10","documentHash":"48122834-7ccc-433b-8777-5bf07fd93a42"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["continuous non-invasive monitoring, blood pressure, intensive care, validation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059592951"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663b55814097070c4ce529c9","name":"Falko","lastName":"Drijfhout","documentHash":"7e234403-1587-4fd0-a8f9-456d4a4987c3"},{"objectId":"663b55814097070c4ce529c8","name":"Amy","lastName":"Johnson","documentHash":"ebc80705-9908-49f0-aa99-c958c82f0706"},{"objectId":"663b55814097070c4ce529c7","name":"Kristina","lastName":"Kljak","documentHash":"340c6ac5-9000-4c09-a972-3d8e20dc182f"},{"objectId":"663b55814097070c4ce529c6","name":"Stephen Paul","lastName":"Rose","documentHash":"e679f3a2-67b1-4513-b80b-0237f689d484"},{"objectId":"663b55814097070c4ce529c5","name":"Jalil Mahmwd","lastName":"Abdulla","documentHash":"051ea3d7-c383-4642-a7fc-96142dc6ee3a"},{"objectId":"663b55814097070c4ce529c4","name":"Isobel Margaret","lastName":"Whiting","documentHash":"18fb4fa6-28cd-456b-af73-3aa7d82534a2"},{"objectId":"663b55814097070c4ce529c3","name":"Stephen Charles","lastName":"Mansbridge","documentHash":"f0291b29-fcb2-4321-b894-581f1c5515f3"},{"objectId":"663b55814097070c4ce529c2","name":"Vasil Radoslavov","lastName":"Pirgozliev","documentHash":"88d4bb4d-fa93-419d-b26d-d4628dbcf15b"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"663b55814097070c4ce529bf","doi":"10.3390/poultry2020012","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2674-1164/2/2/12/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Benefits of Exogenous Xylanase in Wheat–Soy Based Broiler Chicken Diets, Consisting of Different Soluble Non-Starch Polysaccharides Content","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Four wheat-based diets with either a low soluble content of non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs, 13 g/kg); low viscosity, LV) or a high content of NSPs (33.5 g/kg; high viscosity, HV), with and without exogenous xylanase (XYL), were fed to male Ross 308 broiler chickens from 7 to 21 days age.

We compared two gestation housing systems (IMPROVED versus [conventional] CONTROL) in terms of sow stress and welfare indicators and sought to determine whether potential benefits to the sows would translate into improved offspring health. Sows were mixed into 12 stable groups (six groups per treatment, 20 sows per group) 29 days post-service in pens with free-access, full-length individual feeding/lying-stalls. CONTROL pens had fully slatted concrete floors, with two blocks of wood and two chains suspended in the group area. IMPROVED pens were the same but with rubber mats and manila rope in each stall, and straw provided in three racks in the group area. Saliva was collected from each sow on day 80 of pregnancy and analysed for haptoglobin. Hair cortisol was measured in late gestation. Sows' right and left eyes were scored for tear staining in mid lactation and at weaning. Numbers of piglets born alive, dead, mummified, and total born were recorded. Piglets were weighed and scored for vitality and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) at birth. Presence of diarrhoea in farrowing pens was scored every second day throughout the suckling period. IMPROVED sows had lower haptoglobin levels and tear-stain scores during lactation. IMPROVED sows produced fewer mummified piglets, and these had significantly lower IUGR scores, and scored lower for diarrhoea than piglets of CONTROL sows. Hence, improving sow welfare during gestation improved the health and performance of their offspring."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","6638cb054097076e57a91c12"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6638cb054097076e57a91c12","6638cb054097076e57a91c13","6638cb054097076e57a91c14","6638cb054097076e57a91c15","6638cb054097076e57a91c16","6638cb054097076e57a91c17","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547703b","mniswId":"1153","title":"Animal Welfare","issn":"0962-7286","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"3ca7fd69-8126-445f-8521-af30d727bf59"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6638c9224097076e57a8f5ba","year":"2023","volume":"32","documentHash":"cc083684-aa4b-4b91-b460-43970385cdce"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["animal welfare; chronic stress; enrichment; piglet; pregnancy; prenatal."]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059593048"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6638d4284097076e57a9a486","name":"Eva","lastName":"Schaden","documentHash":"549d3bb4-e6de-4650-b908-8348b88bc999"},{"objectId":"6638d4284097076e57a9a485","name":"Christos","lastName":"Tsagkaris","documentHash":"c152f17d-45ee-45f3-aa99-3e2109248665"},{"objectId":"6638d4284097076e57a9a484","name":"Emil D.","lastName":"Parvanov","documentHash":"90c37ee5-4a72-4bbe-976c-f00d3516ae9a"},{"objectId":"6638d4284097076e57a9a483","name":"Rajeev K.","lastName":"Singla","documentHash":"4bf55b0a-2331-4ffa-946d-b5cfe2ad5504"},{"objectId":"6638d4284097076e57a9a482","name":"Ronita","lastName":"De","documentHash":"e0965b09-b8ae-4bc9-802e-9a977defa3ad"},{"objectId":"6638d4284097076e57a9a481","name":"Hari Prasad","lastName":"Devkota","documentHash":"00b804f5-be46-4431-93c0-155b59172f88"},{"objectId":"6638d4284097076e57a9a480","name":"Chandragiri Siva","lastName":"Sai","documentHash":"23591cab-aab1-440a-974a-fca3e0938f53"},{"objectId":"6638d4284097076e57a9a47f","name":"Merisa","lastName":"Cenanovic","documentHash":"1517df83-f313-410f-a2b0-3f61335f8183"},{"objectId":"6638d4284097076e57a9a47e","name":"Faisal A.","lastName":"Nawaz","documentHash":"09427dc0-293d-4eae-9474-6322bfa4a5b7"},{"objectId":"6638d4284097076e57a9a47d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Teufel","documentHash":"4d6d1f01-1c54-4171-b43f-21c7a291bc4f"},{"objectId":"6638d4284097076e57a9a47c","name":"Lorenz","lastName":"Kapral","documentHash":"0bcf480c-5042-4df3-965e-cc1228be680d"},{"objectId":"6638d4284097076e57a9a47b","name":"Fabian","lastName":"Eibensteiner","documentHash":"e0f3101c-7cff-4e83-afde-877e70a77b0e"},{"objectId":"6638d4284097076e57a9a47a","name":"Mojca","lastName":"Hriberšek","documentHash":"4adc6bb8-9776-434b-b8b7-2fb5cdf04c74"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"6638d4284097076e57a9a479","doi":"10.3389/fpubh.2023.1100280","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1100280/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"“Loved ones are not ‘visitors' in a patient's life”—The importance of including loved ones in the patient's hospital stay: An international Twitter study of #HospitalsTalkToLovedOnes in times of COVID-19","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Hospitals are institutions whose primary task is to treat patients. Family-centered care, which considers loved ones as equal partners in patient care, has been gaining recognition in the adult care setting. Our aim was to record experiences of and opinions on communication between hospital-based healthcare providers and patients' loved ones, related but not limited to the rigorous mitigation measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMethods: The Twitter profile @HospitalsTalkTo and hashtag #HospitalsTalkToLovedOnes were created to interact with the Twitter public between 7 June 2021 and 7 February 2022. Conversations surrounding #HospitalsTalkToLovedOnes were extracted and subjected to natural language processing analysis using term frequency and Markov chain analysis. Qualitative thematic analysis was performed on the 10% most interacted tweets and of tweets mentioning “COVID” from a personal experience-based subset.\n\nResults: We collected 4412 unique tweets made or interacted by 7040 Twitter users from 142 different countries. The most frequent words were patient, hospital, care, family, loved and communication. Thematic analysis revealed the importance of communication between patients, patients' loved ones and hospitals; showed that patients and their loved ones need support during a patient's hospital journey; and that pediatric care should be the gold standard for adult care. Visitation restrictions due to COVID-19 are just one barrier to communication, others are a lack of phone signal, no space or time for asking questions, and a complex medical system. We formulate 3 recommendations to improve the inclusion of loved ones into the patient's hospital stay.\n\nConclusions: “Loved ones are not ‘visitors' in a patient's life”. Irrespective of COVID-19, patient's loved ones need to be included during the patient's hospital journey. Transparent communication and patient empowerment increase patient safety and improve the hospital experience for both the patients and their loved ones. Our findings underline the need for the concept of family-centered care to finally be implemented in adult nursing clinical practice."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6638d4284097076e57a9a47a","6638d4284097076e57a9a47b","6638d4284097076e57a9a47c","6638d4284097076e57a9a47d","6638d4284097076e57a9a47e","6638d4284097076e57a9a47f","6638d4284097076e57a9a480","6638d4284097076e57a9a481","6638d4284097076e57a9a482","6638d4284097076e57a9a483","6638d4284097076e57a9a484","6638d4284097076e57a9a485","6638d4284097076e57a9a486","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1b6","mniswId":"6866","title":"Frontiers in Public Health","issn":"2296-2565","eissn":"2296-2565","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"85d71790-6ae8-4a4c-b282-0621a24b8f7b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d8e12940970739948e428d","year":"2023","volume":"11","documentHash":"bfedfa78-ad2d-4e6b-be89-69c5b4b833cc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["family-centered care, doctor–patient relationship, hospital care, social media, visitation restrictions, patient experience, patient safety, crowdsourcing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059593103"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6638c5b74097076e57a8d85a","name":"Jivko","lastName":"Stoyanov","documentHash":"536d4d93-aa38-4976-b5cb-f4a853af2242"},{"objectId":"6638c5b74097076e57a8d859","name":"Marija","lastName":"Glisic","documentHash":"4c1df1f4-66a5-403e-8fa1-07792110b0d0"},{"objectId":"6638c5b74097076e57a8d858","name":"Stevan","lastName":"Stojic","documentHash":"63a75d97-5d9a-42d7-b6a9-c10ae0ae227f"},{"objectId":"6638c5b74097076e57a8d857","name":"Jürgen","lastName":"Pannek","documentHash":"2a855612-6e94-45d5-a2c5-409c00993c11"},{"objectId":"6638c5b74097076e57a8d856","name":"Jörg","lastName":"Krebs","documentHash":"af5ac901-9c98-4f81-8845-2cb9ae450c8c"},{"objectId":"6638c5b74097076e57a8d855","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Boehl","documentHash":"7c0c63fb-3e99-4c17-9c8a-97bad384d16e"},{"objectId":"6638c5b74097076e57a8d854","name":"Ezra","lastName":"Valido","documentHash":"d3b6c5ee-daf2-4cbf-aafa-cc1927c28bf9"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"6638c5b74097076e57a8d853","doi":"10.3390/ijms242216385","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/22/16385/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Immune Status of Individuals with Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) have higher infection rates compared to those without SCI. In this review, the immune status difference between individuals with and without traumatic SCI is investigated by examining their peripheral immune cells and markers. PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Ovid MEDLINE were searched without language or date restrictions. Studies reporting peripheral immune markers’ concentration and changes in functional capabilities of immune cells that compared individuals with and without SCI were included. Studies with participants with active infection, immune disease, and central nervous system (CNS) immune markers were excluded. The review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Effect estimates were measured by Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) using a random-effects model. Study quality was assessed using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Quality Assessment Tool. Fifty-four studies (1813 with SCI and 1378 without SCI) contributed to the meta-analysis. Leukocytes (n = 23, WMD 0.78, 95% CI 0.17; 1.38, I2 83%), neutrophils (n = 11, WMD 0.76, 95% CI 0.09; 1.42, I2 89%), C-reactive protein (CRP) (n = 12, WMD 2.25, 95% CI 1.14; 3.56, I2 95%), and IL6 (n = 13, WMD 2.33, 95% CI 1.20; 3.49, I2 97%) were higher in individuals with SCI vs. without SCI. Clinical factors (phase of injury, completeness of injury, sympathetic innervation impairment, age, sex) and study-related factors (sample size, study design, and serum vs. plasma) partially explained heterogeneity. Immune cells exhibited lower functional capability in individuals with SCI vs. those without SCI. Most studies (75.6%) had a moderate risk of bias. The immune status of individuals with SCI differs from those without SCI and is clinically influenced by the phase of injury, completeness of injury, sympathetic innervation impairment, age, and sex. These results provide information that is vital for monitoring and management strategies to effectively improve the immune status of individuals with SCI."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"16385","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6638c5b74097076e57a8d854","6638c5b74097076e57a8d855","6638c5b74097076e57a8d856","6638c5b74097076e57a8d857","6638c5b74097076e57a8d858","6638c5b74097076e57a8d859","6638c5b74097076e57a8d85a","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"654e01a94097074318041e36","year":"2023","volume":"24","number":"22","documentHash":"72e38715-6e12-48fc-bc26-500ef5b9bb29"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["traumatic spinal cord injury;

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of gradual levels of multi-strain probiotic applied in the Japanese quails’ diet on their performance, carcass, microbiological and immunological parameters. Total of 240 Japanese quail mixed sex chicks were randomly selected into four treatments: 0.15, 0.10, 0.05 g/l of the probiotic and control group not provided with probiotic. Body weight gain (BWG), feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), carcass characteristics, selected gut microbiome species and sheep red blood cell (SRBC) immunoglobulin IgT, IgG and IgM antibodies were determined. Repeated measures ANOVA was performed on parameters related to productive performance of the birds, while one-way ANOVA on all other parameters using SAS software v 9.4.

FCR was the highest in the control and the lowest dose group (3.15±0.28 and 3.07±0.27), as compared to two other groups of birds which received multi-strain probiotic (2.8±0.23 and 2.77±0.24, respectively). Birds in the control group and birds which received the lowest dose of the probiotic had lower counts of IgT (5.63±0.26 and 5.75±0.25, respectively) and IgG (4.00±0.38 and 4.13±0.3, respectively), as compared to two other treatment groups which received the multi-strain probiotic. Birds which did not receive the multi-strain probiotic had significantly lower levels of Lactobacillus (6.98±0.01), as compared to other birds, while those in the control group and which received lowest amount of probiotic had significantly higher levels of E.Coli (6.67±0.01). Multi-strain probiotic had overall positive effect on the selected parameters of Japanese quails’ performance and health, while efficacy varied depending on dosage."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ef878c28a0473c7565","63881fb975234052dad46665","5e7092a1878c28a0473998b4","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","663a0a8b4097077c1aa905b5","60c334699543c723365440d7","5e709489878c28a0473bf258"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"41","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"345-358","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663a0a8b4097077c1aa905af","663a0a8b4097077c1aa905b0","663a0a8b4097077c1aa905b1","663a0a8b4097077c1aa905b2","663a0a8b4097077c1aa905b3","663a0a8b4097077c1aa905b4","663a0a8b4097077c1aa905b5","5e7092a1878c28a0473998b4","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","60c334699543c723365440d7","63881fb975234052dad46665","5e709489878c28a0473bf258","5e7094ef878c28a0473c7565","5e70929c878c28a047399193"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547703a","mniswId":"1152","title":"Animal Science Papers and Reports","issn":"0860-4037","eissn":"2300-8342","websiteLink":"http://www.ighz.edu.pl/?p0=5&p1=34","documentHash":"62bc8bc1-ac27-4424-b0f7-d62320584c68"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65af8b8a4097073321c0c3b7","year":"2023","volume":"41","number":"4","documentHash":"3ad66320-029e-4fdf-9d96-f7065c9286af"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["probiotics; performance; immune response; gut microbiota; Japanese quail"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059596682"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663a18374097077c1aab9d48","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Mandryk","documentHash":"e94a1b75-013e-4f4d-8975-7113474ddf24"},{"objectId":"5f98f237085dcb424e4c1b9c","name":"Iga","lastName":"Bartel","uuid":"D5E820C41151FCECD975218E81CA96BD0D84CB152279F8AA34A5FC4A49C1C387FDFADF9011C81D5D4D781E6B6206964D5B8A9691D8D87422BF97BB0F2A1922C0","orcidId":"0000-0002-8363-2016","documentHash":"2fc8f736-4081-4b2f-9619-a69a08083629"},{"objectId":"5f87bf6c085dcb410a25ef74","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Koszarska","uuid":"B1975463EE86FD1B5D99ABB4BAB6B8A70CEC8A7D217DF620B7B2CF77DD18E12EF7A3AF669CA73759CDC0BCBE4558E032168BB17D7416A7E931AEA5414962C804","orcidId":"0000-0002-0442-6127","documentHash":"6866275f-f278-4c4e-a3ba-ac16bd684582"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399193","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Horbańczuk","uuid":"976205AE9A3DD4FA85531EB44854AE0083FBAD6743C6797D800A9669BD6FAED38693031A6C16E0A03AAE6903DEB2CEF4B47FFF137CB5399DCB5BFBCFCFF25343","orcidId":"0000-0002-7561-0941","documentHash":"a9235661-fb2e-4102-b6a6-35060d6414c3"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739228b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wierzbicka","uuid":"B0DDE44760A24226E4305C616289112453E9EC132DFA6F00E0894A86B7405F22A4A2EBA701343A0E1B561FC95399D36295B388AE3233A9276C697969DCF8F290","orcidId":"0000-0002-5770-4573","documentHash":"27d4f042-4168-4ed2-85a4-49da76166ba4"}],"objectId":"663a18374097077c1aab9d47","doi":"10.3390/nu16010010","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/1/10/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Nutraceutical Properties of Syringic Acid in Civilization Diseases—Review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Civilization diseases account for a worldwide health issue.

The method is quick (20 min for a flock of 7,500 hens), has good interobserver agreement and shows positive correlations with individual bird sampling methods. However, it is less clear whether AT can be used to detect differences in flock health and welfare related to housing and management. The aim of this study was to evaluate how AT findings varied in relation to 23 selected housing, management, environmental, and production factors. The study was conducted on 33 commercial nonbeak-trimmed, white-feathered layer flocks of similar age (70–76 wk) kept in multitiered aviaries in Norway. The most prevalent findings across flocks were feather loss on the back (mean 0.97% of flock) and breast (0.94%) followed by feather loss on the head (0.45%) and tail (0.36%) with differences in feather pecking damage according to the hybrid used (P < 0.05). Better litter quality was associated with a lower prevalence of feather loss on the head and breast (P < 0.05), and addition of fresh litter during the production cycle resulted in fewer birds with feather loss on the head (P < 0.05) and tail (P < 0.001). Lower dust levels were linked to a lower prevalence of feather loss on the head, back, and breast (P < 0.05), and when access to the floor area underneath the aviary was provided at an earlier stage of production, fewer birds had wounds (P < 0.001), but more birds were observed with an enlarged crop (P < 0.05) and found dead (P < 0.05). In conclusion, findings from AT showed that results of the assessment varied according to housing conditions. These results support the validity of AT as a relevant welfare assessment tool for evaluating cage-free management practices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"102","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"102659","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663b526f4097070c4ce4bc9e","663b526f4097070c4ce4bc9f","663b526f4097070c4ce4bca0","663b526f4097070c4ce4bca1","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547934f","mniswId":"16421","title":"POULTRY SCIENCE","issn":"0032-5791","documentHash":"811483b7-60e4-4554-a4b1-68c7cbbfdd17"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64edb8954097076018d9aadc","year":"2023","volume":"102","number":"6","documentHash":"febf0495-aeda-4f8a-abd7-fb8ce21f6640"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["laying hen; aviary housing; animal welfare; welfare assessment methodology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059597279"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663b31834097070c4ce0e552","name":"Jonathan R.","lastName":"Amory","documentHash":"a9516be8-376c-449b-a277-86cfec2a5e86"},{"objectId":"663b31834097070c4ce0e551","name":"Zoe Elizabeth","lastName":"Barker","documentHash":"856f555a-fe76-43f2-bc2a-2403936da927"},{"objectId":"63881fb975234052dad4664e","name":"Sarah","lastName":"Jowett","uuid":"12B80FE06B9B577A89611F1C55B2C4B49AC4D0E2D40F63A7E674D04320D024E855F2EE14C0E394A2B076DCAC6FB8B0293DE288FFA67DE534F1DBF40B48191963","documentHash":"53c4ddcb-16f1-42fb-a015-fa267a81018e"}],"objectId":"663b31834097070c4ce0e550","doi":"10.3389/fvets.2023.1166632","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2023.1166632/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Preferential associations in an unstable social network: applying social network analysis to a dynamic sow herd","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Preferential associations are fitness-enhancing ties between individuals, documented in a range of taxa. Despite this, research into preferential associations remains underrepresented in commercial species, particularly pigs. This study investigates the development of preferential associations in a dynamic sow herd. Preferential associations were defined as approaching a resting sow and then sitting or lying with physical contact with the selected sow, separated by < 1 m from the head or directly next to her, with interaction tolerated for > 60 s. For individual identification, each sow was marked with colored dots, stripes, or both, corresponding to their ear-tag number. Preferential associations were measured over one production cycle of 21 days. Behavioral observations took place on 7 days of the study, with 3 h of behavior per day recorded during peak activity times (08:00–09:00, 15:00–16:00, 20:00–21:00 h). Behaviors were recorded using five cameras, each positioned within the barn to provide coverage of the functional areas. The network metrics applied included in-degree centrality (received ties), out-degree centrality (initiated ties), centralization (the extent to which an individual is central within the network), clustering coefficient (a measure of tie strength), and the E-I Index (a measure of assortment by trait: parity, familiarity, and sociality). Individuals were added and removed during the study, so the centrality metrics of missing sows were weighted. To describe the structure of the network, brokerage typologies were applied. Brokerage typologies include five positions, including coordinators, gatekeepers, representatives, consultants, and liaisons. The results revealed social discrimination in assortment by connectedness even when ties were not reciprocal, and the most connected sows were significantly more likely to be approached than less connected individuals. The most connected sows had significantly higher in-degree and out-degree centrality. With the application of brokerage typologies, the results showed a relationship between connectedness and brokering type, with the most connected sows predominantly engaging in coordinating behavior. The results suggest that the motivation for discrimination in the unstable preferential association network was not founded upon bidirectional interactions. These findings highlight the complexities involved when forming social preferences and present a platform for further exploring the motivations for preferential associations among intensively farmed pigs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63881fb975234052dad4664e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663b31834097070c4ce0e551","663b31834097070c4ce0e552","63881fb975234052dad4664e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb3","mniswId":"22511","title":"Frontiers in Veterinary Science","issn":"2297-1769","eissn":"2297-1769","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"7aca7674-d53a-406a-bc77-ca524899ec80"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407434","year":"2023","volume":"10","documentHash":"6a6ac8c2-1110-4e8c-b867-2e26bb4e0532"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["preferential association, network, connectedness, motivation, pig, social tie"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059597373"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663b3b8b4097070c4ce20be6","name":"Roelof A.","lastName":"Hut","documentHash":"5c64899f-ee56-47a3-aca1-b60a000cb018"},{"objectId":"663b3b8b4097070c4ce20be5","name":"Jeremy B.","lastName":"Searle","documentHash":"68ef7364-3766-4d60-b60c-d0aad5563350"},{"objectId":"663b3b8b4097070c4ce20be4","name":"Louis","lastName":"van de Zande","documentHash":"e54e91ef-44b1-419c-a0e3-816f14e22dbd"},{"objectId":"663b3b8b4097070c4ce20be3","name":"Jan M.","lastName":"Wójcik","documentHash":"bf901719-658a-4cb4-8236-293ef8d3ed73"},{"objectId":"663b3b8b4097070c4ce20be2","name":"Jeremy S.","lastName":"Herman","documentHash":"35c19417-ff0b-460b-b1a9-f99599818d37"},{"objectId":"663b3b8b4097070c4ce20be1","name":"Anna S.","lastName":"Przybylska-Piech","documentHash":"640c1262-f92e-47ef-8c5e-5554a0c2768c"},{"objectId":"663b3b8b4097070c4ce20be0","name":"Wensi","lastName":"Hao","documentHash":"4226b8d1-9e60-43de-8b53-3b0e872c2faa"},{"objectId":"663b3b8b4097070c4ce20bdf","name":"Robin","lastName":"Schepers","documentHash":"d9a849ef-552a-4cb2-ac6d-24706f5b20af"},{"objectId":"663b3b8b4097070c4ce20bde","name":"Laura","lastName":"van Rosmalen","documentHash":"a39249cd-9c15-468c-aac8-537535cb0181"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473aca04","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Stojak","uuid":"E5FCE57AE8D2CB372EC45E4E6EEA6CC7930B0DD54638B2428C235CFE64827AD6839227FB3C40053387C8E8F8C4BC7A92A082BBDC2BD2D38A68B2AB3C4B5846E3","orcidId":"0000-0003-2423-5026","documentHash":"7ff78e06-c1e4-4729-ac0c-c7988088c6a2"}],"objectId":"663b3b8b4097070c4ce20bdd","doi":"10.3390/genes14020292","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/14/2/292/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Seasonal Adaptation: Geographic Photoperiod–Temperature Patterns Explain Genetic Variation in the Common Vole Tsh Receptor","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The vertebrate photoperiodic neuroendocrine system uses the photoperiod as a proxy to time the annual rhythms in reproduction. The thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) is a key protein in the mammalian seasonal reproduction pathway. Its abundance and function can tune sensitivity to the photoperiod. To investigate seasonal adaptation in mammals, the hinge region and the first part of the transmembrane domain of the Tshr gene were sequenced for 278 common vole (Microtus arvalis) specimens from 15 localities in Western Europe and 28 localities in Eastern Europe. Forty-nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; twenty-two intronic and twenty-seven exonic) were found, with a weak or lack of correlation with pairwise geographical distance, latitude, longitude, and altitude. By applying a temperature threshold to the local photoperiod–temperature ellipsoid, we obtained a predicted critical photoperiod (pCPP) as a proxy for the spring onset of local primary food production (grass). The obtained pCPP explains the distribution of the genetic variation in Tshr in Western Europe through highly significant correlations with five intronic and seven exonic SNPs. The relationship between pCPP and SNPs was lacking in Eastern Europe. Thus, Tshr, which plays a pivotal role in the sensitivity of the mammalian photoperiodic neuroendocrine system, was targeted by natural selection in Western European vole populations, resulting in the optimized timing of seasonal reproduction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938d878c28a0473aca04"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"292","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663b3b8b4097070c4ce20bde","663b3b8b4097070c4ce20bdf","663b3b8b4097070c4ce20be0","663b3b8b4097070c4ce20be1","663b3b8b4097070c4ce20be2","663b3b8b4097070c4ce20be3","663b3b8b4097070c4ce20be4","663b3b8b4097070c4ce20be5","663b3b8b4097070c4ce20be6","5e70938d878c28a0473aca04"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477dc4","mniswId":"7014","title":"Genes","issn":"2073-4425","eissn":"2073-4425","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"56f20fcc-0115-4eb8-abc9-6ae7a75aef55"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63cf9cda4097075010efbecc","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"2","documentHash":"cfbc228a-afbf-4366-a8c7-70c877ca82f5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["seasonal reproduction; Tsh receptor; temperature–photoperiod ellipsoid; natural selection; Microtus arvalis; common vole; climate change"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059600376"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663b37014097070c4ce1780e","name":"Pasqualino","lastName":"Loi","documentHash":"34f255e7-f5f5-400e-affc-a6093cf99c86"},{"objectId":"663b37014097070c4ce1780d","name":"Marta","lastName":"Czernik","documentHash":"d0e82a87-d291-4703-9026-c567d4d8b2cb"},{"objectId":"663b37014097070c4ce1780c","name":"Kazutsugu","lastName":"Matsukawa","documentHash":"bbe2af17-8b31-4683-b9df-ad1d4191670f"},{"objectId":"663b37014097070c4ce1780b","name":"Alessia","lastName":"Luciani","documentHash":"fdf45a8b-4f41-4217-a031-37311163c8af"},{"objectId":"663b37014097070c4ce1780a","name":"Flavia","lastName":"Pizzi","documentHash":"e232cc77-e044-45bc-befa-e18cae31b220"},{"objectId":"663b37014097070c4ce17809","name":"Sophie","lastName":"Tuffet","documentHash":"4ca39b92-4c15-4e66-bb61-38098c4d8867"},{"objectId":"663b37014097070c4ce17808","name":"Marthe","lastName":"Colotte","documentHash":"22929c49-88db-4402-b378-22d8610b2d9e"},{"objectId":"663b37014097070c4ce17807","name":"Jacques","lastName":"Bonnet","documentHash":"ef332053-d887-4b2d-8079-be3ffb3a2fc9"},{"objectId":"663b37014097070c4ce17806","name":"Joseph","lastName":"Saragusty","documentHash":"4c265c7d-727f-4e03-87e0-1e2b4148f5fb"},{"objectId":"663b37014097070c4ce17805","name":"Debora Agata","lastName":"Anzalone","documentHash":"98bc63d0-6831-4a63-ba09-f25b3dace87a"},{"objectId":"663b37014097070c4ce17804","name":"Federica","lastName":"Turri","documentHash":"f5a9564c-1b72-4a72-93c7-3b3ecfc63108"},{"objectId":"5ffeae33085dcb0e357dcc5f","name":"Luca","lastName":"Palazzese","uuid":"565DB28A107D274FBCFDB699FD69E249CFEFB7C12390DFF7A83ED822605F437D9F239A2B3E427E33D3415C2A272F5C50FA7315BC62078496FC2D9EFFF119E977","documentHash":"56cd888c-c966-42a1-9d6a-727431eb712b"}],"objectId":"663b37014097070c4ce17803","doi":"10.3389/fvets.2023.1270266","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2023.1270266/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Reviving vacuum-dried encapsulated ram spermatozoa via ICSI after 2 years of storage","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Freeze-drying techniques give alternative preservation mammalian spermatozoa without liquid nitrogen.

Likewise, in VDE the embryonic development was higher than in FD samples (12.8% vs. 8.7%, p < 0.001, respectively).

This study aims to investigate discussions regarding patient safety, as well as summarize perceived approaches to mitigating risks of adverse events expressed through the #PatientSafety Twitter hashtag during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMethods: This research is grounded in the analysis of data extracted from Twitter under the hashtag #PatientSafety between December 1, 2019 and February 1, 2023. Symplur Signals, which represents a tool offering a method to monitor tweets containing hashtags registered with the Symplur Healthcare Hashtag Project, was used for analyzing the tweets shared in the study period. For text analytics of the relevant data, we further used the word cloud generator MonkeyLearn, and VOSviewer.\nResults: The analysis encompasses 358′809 tweets that were shared by 90′079 Twitter users, generating a total of 1′183’384′757 impressions. Physicians contributed to 18.65% of all tweets, followed by other healthcare professionals (14.31%), and health-focused individuals (10.91%). Geographically, more than a third of tweets (60.90%) were published in the United States. Canada and India followed in second and third positions, respectively. Blocks of trending terms of greater interest to the global Twitter community within the hashtag #PatientSafety were determined to be: “Patient,” “Practical doctors,” and “Health Care Safety Management.” The findings demonstrate the engagement of the Twitter community with COVID-19 and problems related to the training, experience of doctors and patients during a pandemic, communication, the vaccine safety and effectiveness, and potential use of off-label drugs. Noteworthy, in the field of pharmacovigilance, Twitter has the possibility of identifying adverse reactions associated with the use of drugs, including vaccines. The issue of medical errors has been also discussed by Twitter users using the hashtag #PatientSafety.\nConclusion: It is clear that various stakeholders, including students, medical practitioners, health organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory bodies, leverage Twitter to rapidly exchange medical information, data on the disease symptoms, and the drug effects. Consequently, there is a need to further integrate Twitter-derived data into the operational routines of healthcare organizations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","645c532940e3ff38f8b52cde","622970b87523402df08fac6b","622970b87523402df08fac76"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663b2c9b4097070c4cdfe97e","663b2c9b4097070c4cdfe97f","663b2c9b4097070c4cdfe980","663b2c9b4097070c4cdfe981","663b2c9b4097070c4cdfe982","622970b87523402df08fac6b","645c532940e3ff38f8b52cde","622970b87523402df08fac76","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1b6","mniswId":"6866","title":"Frontiers in Public Health","issn":"2296-2565","eissn":"2296-2565","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"85d71790-6ae8-4a4c-b282-0621a24b8f7b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d8e12940970739948e428d","year":"2023","volume":"11","documentHash":"bfedfa78-ad2d-4e6b-be89-69c5b4b833cc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["patient safety, Twitter, hashtag, COVID-19, adverse events, pharmacovigilance, vaccine, healthcare"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059600724"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663b495f4097070c4ce3d083","name":"Sébastien","lastName":"Goumon","documentHash":"b76775fb-a1fa-4c07-b6e5-5e275107c5ee"},{"objectId":"63881fb975234052dad4664e","name":"Sarah","lastName":"Jowett","uuid":"12B80FE06B9B577A89611F1C55B2C4B49AC4D0E2D40F63A7E674D04320D024E855F2EE14C0E394A2B076DCAC6FB8B0293DE288FFA67DE534F1DBF40B48191963","documentHash":"53c4ddcb-16f1-42fb-a015-fa267a81018e"},{"objectId":"5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","name":"Irene","lastName":"Camerlink","uuid":"63511C46590F3B7E26AA60526C552EED8D9F0549F8DEE5333E681582883DA44BB38FF69E2CB85D2955FD7C17DC6CFA4F35E7BE97ABD84CE52B2422233F186398","documentHash":"21f3e447-93d1-4634-92b3-8aae9343fdc4"}],"objectId":"663b495f4097070c4ce3d081","doi":"10.1016/j.applanim.2023.105922","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0168159123000941?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Special issue on social relationships in farm animals","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Social behaviour has an important role in animals’ daily behaviour.

The alteration of the Th17/Tregs axis is highly significant for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Th17 and Treg cells share a large portion of their transcriptome, albeit with distinct functions. The mechanisms governing the bifurcation of Th17 /Treg axis differentiation from naïve T cells are not yet understood. This study aims to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and gene-enriched pathways that contribute to the distinction between these closely aligned phenotypes. We analyzed RNA sequencing data of CD4+ T cells differentiated in vitro into Th0, Th17, and Tregs phenotypes and built gene enrichment networks. We studied the network rewiring of Th17 and Tregs from Th0 cells. In addition to common pathways and genes that are equally expressed between these two distinct phenotypes, we identified key genes and pathways that contribute to their distinctiveness. For example, the Keap1 gene and several of its interactors such as MCC1 were upregulated in Tregs indicating that Tregs possess mechanisms that prevent the over-activation of antioxidants pathways. Tregs also possess several genes that are involved in the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP as RAB37, ATP1A2, ATP1B, and PDE2A to ensure Treg anti-inflammatory capabilities. Additionally, one of the pathways that ensure Tregs differentiation and function seems to point toward an insulin role mediated by APOL9B and GOLM. Taken together our findings shed light on various essential regulators of the Th17/Treg axis and pave the way for treatment strategies that selectively target one phenotype while sparing the other."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e70927a878c28a047396795","5e7092b0878c28a04739ab9a","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"41","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"79-93","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5e70927a878c28a047396795","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","5e7092b0878c28a04739ab9a","5e70929c878c28a047399193"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547703a","mniswId":"1152","title":"Animal Science Papers and Reports","issn":"0860-4037","eissn":"2300-8342","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"fe90747c-1196-49b0-9210-8098e8db0aa8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6436ac604097075c99188c31","year":"2023","volume":"41","number":"1","documentHash":"2964a52c-7f50-4bb9-9760-c4685bdb46f5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Th17 cells; Treg cells; differentiation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059604767"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6655ab2040970762c87b8fb8","name":"Pasqualino","lastName":"Loi","documentHash":"e1db9e12-2b4a-4d38-b982-58be559cff6f"},{"objectId":"6655ab2040970762c87b8fb7","name":"Kazutsugu","lastName":"Matsukawa","documentHash":"85d4fb33-7758-4ad7-ac1d-28b8bbf5647b"},{"objectId":"6655ab2040970762c87b8fb6","name":"Marta","lastName":"Czernik","documentHash":"8983b676-70ad-4f17-aec9-3c66c4f32f30"},{"objectId":"5ffeae33085dcb0e357dcc5f","name":"Luca","lastName":"Palazzese","uuid":"565DB28A107D274FBCFDB699FD69E249CFEFB7C12390DFF7A83ED822605F437D9F239A2B3E427E33D3415C2A272F5C50FA7315BC62078496FC2D9EFFF119E977","documentHash":"56cd888c-c966-42a1-9d6a-727431eb712b"}],"objectId":"6655ab2040970762c87b8fb5","doi":"10.1007/978-1-0716-3064-8_11","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-0716-3064-8_11","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer Using Freeze-Dried Protaminized Donor Nuclei","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is the only nuclear reprogramming method that allows rewinding an adult nucleus into a totipotent state. As such, it offers excellent opportunities for the multiplication of elite genotypes or endangered animals, whose number have shrunk to below the threshold of safe existence. Disappointingly, SCNT efficiency is still low. Hence, it would be wise to store somatic cells from threatened animals in biobanks. We were the first to show that freeze-dried cells allow generating blastocysts upon SCNT. Only a few papers have been published on the topic since then, and viable offspring have not been produced. On the other hand, lyophilization of mammalian spermatozoa has made considerable progress, partially due to the physical stability that protamines provide to the genome. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that a somatic cell could be made more amenable to the oocyte reprogramming by the exogenous expression of human Protamine 1. Given that the protamine also provides natural protection against dehydration stress, we have combined the cell protaminization and lyophilization protocols. This chapter comprehensively describes the protocol for somatic cell protaminization, lyophilization, and its application in SCNT. We are confident that our protocol will be relevant for establishing somatic cells stocks amenable to reprogramming at low cost."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ffeae33085dcb0e357dcc5f","6655ab2040970762c87b8fb6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"211-224","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6655ab2040970762c87b8fb6","6655ab2040970762c87b8fb7","6655ab2040970762c87b8fb8","5ffeae33085dcb0e357dcc5f"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6655aa2340970762c87b7fde","doi":"10.1007/978-1-0716-3064-8","title":"Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer Technology","year":2023,"isbn":"9781071630631","issn":"1064-3745","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-0716-3064-8.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"9ce4451b-0dcb-429b-a23f-8fb29bdb568b","publisher":{"objectId":"5e710aa146e0fb0001ba6e5b","name":"Springer US","documentHash":"7acc4751-473c-4118-b7be-5f03f907a1c1"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059625650"},{"authors":[],"objectId":"66b5b493fdbe836dd0c35a49","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780323856768/advances-in-pig-welfare?via=ihub=#book-info","type":"EDITED_BOOK","typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","year":2023,"title":"Advances in Pig Welfare","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Advances in Pig Welfare, Second Edition continues its complete coverage of the field with fully updated information and analysis of current issues in the key areas of pig welfare.

Part two provides an overview of production systems and reviews welfare hotspots and mitigation. Part three covers pig welfare management topics, such as pig-human interactions and precision livestock farming. Global perspectives on pig welfare, including economics, legislation, farmers attitudes and climate change, are covered in Part 4.\n\nWritten by an international team of renowned researchers in the field, the book continues to be a useful resource for practicing vets involved in welfare assessment, welfare research scientists and students, and indeed, anyone with a professional interest in the welfare of pigs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"EDITOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","66b5b493fdbe836dd0c35a4a"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"978-0-323-85676-8","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb923","mniswId":"64600","name":"Woodhead Publishing","documentHash":"0ff30de7-da8a-4b09-9034-ab1678636d20"},"editors":[{"objectId":"66b5b493fdbe836dd0c35a4a","name":"Emma","lastName":"Baxter","documentHash":"ea64cb75-b66a-4be0-91ce-cdcc715759c6"},{"objectId":"5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","name":"Irene","lastName":"Camerlink","uuid":"63511C46590F3B7E26AA60526C552EED8D9F0549F8DEE5333E681582883DA44BB38FF69E2CB85D2955FD7C17DC6CFA4F35E7BE97ABD84CE52B2422233F186398","documentHash":"21f3e447-93d1-4634-92b3-8aae9343fdc4"}],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059716720"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70930c878c28a0473a1ca1","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Skiba","uuid":"AF72852307FB79A935756846C1F4718AB9B3967811B4C0E065A961257EC97AB9ACBE234E32B3803AB9B2D1E49DB0ED763C5A6ACF86373410A2AF04215073CA36","orcidId":"0000-0002-5910-2955","documentHash":"10994451-7b67-4e8e-9d54-3e5da5b72358"}],"objectId":"66b5da19fdbe836dd0c593cd","publicUri":"https://edraurban.pl/ksiazka/immunologia-wyd2","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Problemy immunologiczne w chorobach sercowo-naczyniowych","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70930c878c28a0473a1ca1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70930c878c28a0473a1ca1"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"66b5d9befdbe836dd0c581c5","title":"Immunologia, wyd.2","year":2023,"isbn":"9788367447355","url":"https://edraurban.pl/ksiazka/immunologia-wyd2","translation":false,"documentHash":"a07334b9-0daa-4983-a3ee-265368311ea2","publisher":{"objectId":"5d3826ae878c2809a72ec590","mniswId":"22100","name":"Edra Urban & Partner","documentHash":"a67f9716-f79f-406a-a08f-607179986af7"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059736122"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66b5e2e1fdbe836dd0c5d1c1","name":"Zygmunt","lastName":"Krasiński","documentHash":"79ae4894-57d8-47f1-8c59-a28d112cf4b1"},{"objectId":"622970b87523402df08fac76","name":"Cyprian","lastName":"Tomasik","uuid":"040B9217423B5A3482F9FF4AD47C146447F3CE2BF2BEFF84897B67CCA770A685F358AC0D98FD2A9E5D4A0EB4573AD04EFA8A0BC81E153A5428E3EB3A8DE71C21","documentHash":"55b1fb01-f04f-4e36-b8f5-f121d251ba8d"}],"objectId":"66b5e2e1fdbe836dd0c5d1c0","doi":"10.1108/978-1-80382-701-820231057","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/978-1-80382-701-820231057/full/xml","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Research Management and Administration in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This chapter outlines milestones and circumstances that led to the evolution of the profession of research management and administration (RMA) in Poland. The RMA has a history stretching back around 20 years, with the breakthrough year being in 2007, when the Polish National Council for Research Project Coordinators (KRAB) was established. Currently, the Polish community of RMA is scattered across universities, scientific and research institutes; and its RMAs are employed in research support centres, national/international research programmes offices or welcome offices. At the national level, main activities concerning RMA are centred around KRAB and its pool of activities related to research project management implemented by International Project Management Association (IPMA) Poland. In some respects, RMA can still be considered a semi-profession in the country; and RMAs are that part of the administration staff engaged with the development of scientific excellence in research institutions: they are more often an invisible workforce, but necessary to project development and related activities. There are no dedicated RMA certifications available yet, however, support for RMAs in Poland has been consistently becoming stronger and more widespread over the years in the higher education system (HES) and beyond."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622970b87523402df08fac76"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"613-621","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66b5e2e1fdbe836dd0c5d1c1","622970b87523402df08fac76"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"66b5e25afdbe836dd0c5ce23","title":"The Emerald Handbook of Research Management and Administration Around the World","year":2023,"isbn":"978-1-80382-702-5","url":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/publication/doi/10.1108/9781803827018","translation":false,"documentHash":"e129fce8-9ae6-422c-88a2-a35071c93279","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7dd","mniswId":"22700","name":"Emerald Publishing","documentHash":"c2aa91cc-4fa3-4329-a230-ba6e8e71085f"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Poland; research management and administration; professionalism; educational/training network; KRAB; RAAAP"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059736280"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"92D7C04F8AB3A7BAFDD427A486DDA8E51BB9EF910CE1748A4A41C1B5DD9D2FBC73939751C42B68AF9AB4431CFBC5570C935A57B7BE63B7045AA234AF1888672B","documentHash":"da59b83b-fda3-4817-8136-ba0e1298aa2f"}],"objectId":"66b5d83afdbe836dd0c55a56","doi":"10.53271/wglsonk.2023.3.1","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.53271/wglsonk.2023.3.1","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Etiopatogeneza HCC – perspektywa biologa molekularnego","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Wydanie z serii „W gabinecie lekarza specjalisty” z dziedziny onkologii poświęcone rakowi wątrobowokomórkowemu.

Over the past five years, nano-Se has attracted a great deal of attention in terms of its production, characterisation and possible application in poultry production. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary levels of inorganic and organic Se, selenised yeast and nano forms of selenium on breast meat quality, liver and blood markers of antioxidants, the ultrastructure of tissue and the health status of chickens. A total of 300 one-day-old chicks Ross 308 were divided into 4 experimental groups, in 5 replications, with 15 birds per replication. Birds were fed the following treatments: a standard commercial diet containing inorganic Se in the form of inorganic Se at the level of 0.3 mg/kg diet and an experimental diet with an increased level of Se (0.5 mg/kg diet). The use of other forms of Se (nano-Se) versus sodium selenate significantly influences (p ≤ 0.05) a higher collagen content and does not impair physico-chemical properties in the breast muscle or the growth performance of the chickens. In addition, the use of other forms of selenium at an increased dose versus sodium selenate affected (p ≤ 0.01) the elongation of sarcomeres in the pectoral muscle while reducing (p ≤ 0.01) mitochondrial damage in hepatocytes and improving (p ≤ 0.05) oxidative indices. The use of nano-Se at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg feed has high bioavailability and low toxicity without negatively affecting the growth performance and while improving breast muscle quality parameters and the health status of the chickens."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea4","uid":"bdue8IYFHJjfPMqPlXSYxbA","uuid":"30312732-6777-4ca9-84e6-ad3f07bc18c2","name":"Instytut Fizjologii i Żywienia Zwierząt im.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression and are implicated in various cancer types, including CMTs. This study aimed to investigate the altered miRNA expression patterns in CMTs and their potential role in tumorigenesis. We analyzed miRNA profiles in a cohort of CMT samples and matched normal tissues using a custom canine panel microarray slide (Agilent technology). The bioinformatics analysis overlapped the altered miRNA signature in CMT with human breast cancer miRNA (TCGA patient cohort). The biological significance of this altered miRNA signature was evaluated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Our results revealed a distinctive miRNA expression signature associated with CMTs compared to normal mammary tissues, and when overlapped with human breast cancer miRNA data (TCGA cohort), we identified a common signature composed of one overexpressed transcript and eight downregulated transcripts. In conclusion, our study provides comprehensive insights into the altered miRNA expression patterns in CMTs, shedding light on their potential contribution to the pathogenesis of these tumors. Further investigation into the specific roles of these dysregulated miRNAs is warranted to elucidate their precise involvement in CMT progression and to explore their therapeutic implications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"42","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"217-230","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6799f472fdbe831aedc9031f","6799f472fdbe831aedc90320","6799f472fdbe831aedc90321","6799f472fdbe831aedc90322","6799f472fdbe831aedc90323","6799f472fdbe831aedc90324","6799f472fdbe831aedc90325","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","6799f472fdbe831aedc90326"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547703a","mniswId":"1152","title":"Animal Science Papers and Reports","issn":"0860-4037","eissn":"2300-8342","websiteLink":"http://www.ighz.edu.pl/?p0=5&p1=34","documentHash":"62bc8bc1-ac27-4424-b0f7-d62320584c68"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"668bcf1dfdbe8315e75393c8","year":"2024","volume":"42","number":"2","documentHash":"49d1836e-6f31-47fd-ab0a-6d1669fe2c99"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["canine mammary tumors; miRNA; biomarkers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060444630"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679a39abfdbe831aedce64c8","name":"Mukesh K.","lastName":"Chalise","documentHash":"3f197d1d-5b5f-489c-98ca-84612665305e"},{"objectId":"679a39abfdbe831aedce64c7","name":"Laxman","lastName":"Khanal","documentHash":"e9e1755f-5c03-4f77-84f5-4bdfd87798ee"},{"objectId":"679a39abfdbe831aedce64c6","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Koirala","documentHash":"1524c80c-fd7a-4f3a-9df0-8a8b794075b4"},{"objectId":"679a39abfdbe831aedce64c5","name":"Pavan K.","lastName":"Paudel","documentHash":"e344fbbe-3a4d-446f-b15b-33ec90f3f7de"},{"objectId":"679a39abfdbe831aedce64c4","name":"Hideshi","lastName":"Ogawa","documentHash":"2228fce7-b189-4b8f-adb3-48759185da6f"},{"objectId":"623159b87523402df092adf8","name":"Sunil","lastName":"Khatiwada","uuid":"BB8AD6E22420141CDE9C3C859C1FB6D7F228E68078639B36B0385EC905B6ED8F747BC7B2C4185339A2AD4567FAE41CDD9ED45BE33DFEDB6CC2737D63E6D0600D","documentHash":"dd5b6c12-2b96-4689-8b47-0181ede7697a"}],"objectId":"679a39abfdbe831aedce64c2","doi":"10.3106/ms2023-0061","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3106/ms2023-0061","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Distribution and Group Composition of Assamese and Rhesus Macaques in Northwestern Kathmandu, Nepal","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis) and rhesus macaques (M. mulatta) are sympatrically distributed in Nepal but differ in many traits. Data on 11 groups of Assamese macaques and 13 groups of rhesus macaques in northwestern Kathmandu show that Assamese macaques inhabited only protected forests in Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park, whereas rhesus macaques inhabited even small forests disturbed by people in temples close to cultivated and urban areas, frequently raided crops, and were provisioned. Assamese macaques inhabited higher altitude and formed smaller groups with more adult males and fewer immatures than rhesus macaques. Rhesus macaques' proclivity to be provisioned supported their large groups. However, their strict dominance hierarchy might make low-ranking males solitary, whereas many males of Assamese macaques might be able to stay together because of their affiliative relationship with other males. In Nepal, Assamese macaques might adopt more K-reproductive strategies with a larger body, fewer offspring, and lower twin frequency in stable circumstances, compared to rhesus macaques. Competition for resources promotes niche separation in food choice and habitat use, which might strengthen the inter-species difference and make their coexistence possible. We recommend careful maintenance of forests to protect Assamese macaques, and effective managements of provisioned and crop-raiding rhesus macaques."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623159b87523402df092adf8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"49","issue":"3","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679a39abfdbe831aedce64c4","623159b87523402df092adf8","679a39abfdbe831aedce64c5","679a39abfdbe831aedce64c6","679a39abfdbe831aedce64c7","679a39abfdbe831aedce64c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d4d","mniswId":"13857","title":"MAMMAL STUDY","issn":"1343-4152","eissn":"1348-6160","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"c0be4c92-1f82-4cb2-9796-db3670160b65"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679a39abfdbe831aedce64c3","year":"2024","volume":"49","number":"3","documentHash":"ec4e2947-801d-4d73-8733-41baa54eda15"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Assamese macaques; rhesus macaques; Nepal"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060447354"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679a2fccfdbe831aedcd84ec","name":"Harald","lastName":"Willschke","documentHash":"bb358396-46c4-4228-9562-264a9cf1050b"},{"objectId":"679a2fccfdbe831aedcd84eb","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kletecka-Pulker","documentHash":"9cbab579-352f-4c7b-ad9d-9ae800de0d6f"},{"objectId":"679a2fccfdbe831aedcd84ea","name":"Fabian Peter","lastName":"Hammerle","documentHash":"aa2233b9-5d77-40ae-927b-f6c272af52c1"},{"objectId":"679a2fccfdbe831aedcd84e9","name":"Andy Wai Kan","lastName":"Yeung","documentHash":"e7e6dde3-ba3a-4745-8af4-0e627f8d14f5"},{"objectId":"679a2fccfdbe831aedcd84e8","name":"Olena","lastName":"Litvinova","documentHash":"c6635aa5-ed50-4f6e-a4cd-7e5b7fbf5548"},{"objectId":"671610cdece39836623b1eff","name":"Maima","lastName":"Matin","uuid":"028B8E8EDCF7D67A78E16C226F937DAAC626533E030CC2CD79DF049C5F6AC008ED2C671E37A5912CDF0CC34E742667D43D8854F7413AC6FB857EBF57B01E355C","documentHash":"52857f92-cb97-439c-860d-0d296c5467a7"},{"objectId":"612d94299543c7051ff01b28","name":"Michel ","lastName":"Mickael","uuid":"6C0F190719C006F28401303260F31EB975571B3A00976F324446353810A0BEBD070D7D62CAB7367E88BFD3385375A74E21C88497F33459BA7C60F5AA5C3267FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-4186-4900","documentHash":"93399ad0-db2d-4c58-b04e-476d4131aaa8"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"679a2fccfdbe831aedcd84e7","doi":"10.3390/ph17030395","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/17/3/395/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Digital Technology Applications in the Management of Adverse Drug Reactions: Bibliometric Analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Adverse drug reactions continue to be not only one of the most urgent problems in clinical medicine, but also a social problem.

The search was conducted using the Web of Science database for the period 1991–2023. A positive trend in publications in the field of using digital technologies in the management of adverse drug reactions was revealed. A total of 72% of all relevant publications come from the following countries: the USA, China, England, India, and Germany. Among the organizations most active in the field of drug side effect management using digital technologies, American and Chinese universities dominate. Visualization of publication keywords using VOSviewer software 1.6.18 revealed four clusters: “preclinical studies”, “clinical trials”, “pharmacovigilance”, and “reduction of adverse drug reactions in order to improve the patient’s quality of life”. Molecular design technologies, virtual models for toxicity modeling, data integration, and drug repurposing are among the key digital tools used in the preclinical research phase. Integrating the application of machine learning algorithms for data analysis, monitoring of electronic databases of spontaneous messages, electronic medical records, scientific databases, social networks, and analysis of digital device data into clinical trials and pharmacovigilance systems, can significantly improve the efficiency and safety of drug development, implementation, and monitoring processes.

The study was conducted in four flocks of Orvia ST5 ducks, reared in two identical buildings. Flocks 1 and 3 were housed in building 1, while flocks 2 and 4 occupied building 2. A total of 8,000 ducklings were allocated to rearing, with 2,000 in each flock. The welfare of the ducks was assessed at 5, 6, and 7 weeks of age using the TW method, which involved assessing indicators such as immobility, lameness, dirtiness, small size, head wounds, back wounds, tail wounds, feather loss, illness, terminal illness, being flipped, or being deceased. Information regarding factors contributing to reduced carcass quality was gathered from the slaughterhouse. It was observed that all welfare indicators, except for head and tail wounds, were equally effective in assessing duck welfare and accounted for up to 82.13% of the variation in welfare. Lameness emerged as the most prevalent factor associated with reduced welfare, showing a strong correlation with immobility. Both indicators exhibited a significant interaction with age and flock (P = 0.001 and P = 0.029, respectively). Feather loss emerged as another crucial indicator of reduced welfare in the examined flocks. The percentage of featherless ducks varied from 0.29% to 3.50% and was significantly influenced by both duck age and flock (both P<0.001). Additionally, it showed a significant and positive correlation with immobility (P<0.05). The primary issues identified during duck culling were associated with skin problems and leg and joint issues. Statistically significant variations were noted among flocks concerning the frequency of indicators linked to reduced welfare. This variance was attributed to the specific building where the ducks were raised. The findings of this study suggest the incorporation of the TW method in future welfare assessments, utilizing the 10 welfare indicators employed while excluding head and tail wounds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","60c334699543c723365440d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"329-342","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679a0802fdbe831aedca5303","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","679a0802fdbe831aedca5304","60c334699543c723365440d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec003dead49b31cced788d6","title":"Annals of Animal Science","issn":"2300-8733","eissn":"2300-8733","documentHash":"9f0b0c28-a3b3-40fe-bf64-01767c1ffd8d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679a0802fdbe831aedca5302","year":"2025","volume":"25","number":"1","documentHash":"04cc9f6d-ea26-4817-9be8-a4200854a1ee"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Pekin duck, welfare assessment, commercial farm"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060447664"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b4941fdbe8318b4ca520b","name":"Elisabeth","lastName":"Klager","documentHash":"d29b6d45-d6ec-41b5-8b97-a364ea596094"},{"objectId":"679b4941fdbe8318b4ca520a","name":"Sabine","lastName":"Völkl-Kernstock","documentHash":"3de0fe94-6411-4fcf-9b04-97ccc4b981fd"},{"objectId":"679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5209","name":"Mathias","lastName":"Maleczek","documentHash":"8b11490a-3e12-42b5-8eb8-c7cdfe3ed5e1"},{"objectId":"679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5208","name":"Eva","lastName":"Schaden","documentHash":"a9c27b38-092f-4464-91c0-e699ecc2f1b1"},{"objectId":"679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5207","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kletecka-Pulker","documentHash":"983a7422-9551-480d-afed-5a7ba325d012"},{"objectId":"679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5206","name":"Marcus Alexander","lastName":"Gabriel","documentHash":"0cdc8a9c-beae-4839-925e-e83cfad0a457"},{"objectId":"679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5205","name":"Sophie","lastName":"Klomfar","documentHash":"08a5d31a-64b2-4584-9cad-b13a1b8c785e"},{"objectId":"679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5204","name":"Gernot","lastName":"Gerger","documentHash":"3136a3f8-bf65-4399-8d60-b8bce9296b2b"},{"objectId":"679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5203","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Eitenberger","documentHash":"bd21c3b7-2445-4f99-b978-62e8424208f0"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5201","doi":"10.1177/20552076241257042","publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20552076241257042","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Focusing on experts: Expectations of healthcare professionals regarding the use of telemedicine in intensive care units","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"ObjectivesTelemedical applications are solutions to challenges in the healthcare system. However, it is unclear what intensive care unit healthcare professionals expect from such solutions. This study investigated the expectations and concerns of nurses and physicians when implementing telemedicine tools in intensive care units (tele-ICU).\nMethodsThe study was conducted in intensive care units in 2020 during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It used a mixed-methods approach targeted at physicians and nurses and involved 14 qualitative interviews and 63 quantitative questionnaires.\nResultsThe qualitative and quantitative data showed that both nurses and physicians were willing to use tele-ICU. Nurses recognised the advantages of real-time access to expertise offered by tele-ICU, but feared this would reduce physicians’ on-site patient time. Physicians, in turn, were concerned that they would be expected to be continuously on call. The majority in both groups agreed that any tele-ICU solution must be simple to use and integrate easily into existing organisational structures, networks, and work routines. Additionally, COVID-19 significantly influenced expectations: those who reported having more personal health concerns during the pandemic were more predisposed to favour the use of tele-ICU.\nConclusionsOverall, tele-ICU supports better care, but a successful implementation depends on its ease of use and context-sensitive approaches. Effectively integrating tele-ICU solutions into daily clinical routines requires input from nurses and physicians and their involvement in the implementation process from the outset, as well as consideration of existing organisational structures. Such measures will vastly increase the chance of acceptance and successful adoption of telemedical solutions in clinical practice."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5203","679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5204","679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5205","679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5206","679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5207","679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5208","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5209","679b4941fdbe8318b4ca520a","679b4941fdbe8318b4ca520b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bf2d","mniswId":"5083","title":"Digital Health","issn":"2055-2076","eissn":"2055-2076","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"43c37ca5-9b69-40ae-a660-ba448896e882"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679b4941fdbe8318b4ca5202","year":"2024","volume":"10","documentHash":"e6c3dc9a-3296-4580-87bb-e3bfdc7b3c6b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Telemedicine, mixed-methods, digital health, intensive care technology, implementation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060449627"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b6c75fdbe8318b4cd2455","name":"Marianne","lastName":"Farish","documentHash":"22edc80c-bec9-4cf7-a4d0-4c725ef08169"},{"objectId":"679b6c75fdbe8318b4cd2454","name":"Simon P.","lastName":"Turner","documentHash":"b665c2c4-2b7f-4e50-8577-d06f8a6b9b74"},{"objectId":"623159b87523402df092adf8","name":"Sunil","lastName":"Khatiwada","uuid":"BB8AD6E22420141CDE9C3C859C1FB6D7F228E68078639B36B0385EC905B6ED8F747BC7B2C4185339A2AD4567FAE41CDD9ED45BE33DFEDB6CC2737D63E6D0600D","documentHash":"dd5b6c12-2b96-4689-8b47-0181ede7697a"},{"objectId":"5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","name":"Irene","lastName":"Camerlink","uuid":"63511C46590F3B7E26AA60526C552EED8D9F0549F8DEE5333E681582883DA44BB38FF69E2CB85D2955FD7C17DC6CFA4F35E7BE97ABD84CE52B2422233F186398","documentHash":"21f3e447-93d1-4634-92b3-8aae9343fdc4"}],"objectId":"679b6c75fdbe8318b4cd2452","doi":"10.1016/j.beproc.2024.105099","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0376635724001141?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Leadership amongst pigs when faced with a novel situation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Leadership is a risky behaviour that can impact individuals and groups. Leaders, i.e. individuals who perform or initiate a task while other individuals in the group follow, have been studied in different contexts, but there is still a lack of understanding on the role of individual characteristics that may predispose them to become leaders, such as dominance and personality. In particular, the characteristics of leaders in domestic animal populations has been poorly examined. We studied leadership within 32 groups of young pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus, n = 366 individuals). Leadership was assessed during a group-based fear test (Human Approach Test) which was repeated three times. The first individual per group to touch the person was identified as leader. We assessed repeatability of leadership and characteristics of leaders as compared to followers. Leadership was marginally repeatable, with 6 out of 26 groups having a consistent single leader across all tests. Females had odds 4.13 times greater than males of being a leader, while there was no effect of body weight (a proxy of dominance) or coping style on leadership. The results indicate a similarity with wild populations, in which females lead the herd even though the males, which are superior in body weight, are often dominant."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623159b87523402df092adf8","5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"222","pagesFromTo":"105099","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["623159b87523402df092adf8","679b6c75fdbe8318b4cd2454","679b6c75fdbe8318b4cd2455","5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454772ee","mniswId":"2304","title":"BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES","issn":"0376-6357","eissn":"1872-8308","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0838dc72-6a84-4b9b-ae80-921fbe534c24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679b6c75fdbe8318b4cd2453","year":"2024","volume":"222","documentHash":"3f02e5fa-57ee-46ef-8cb8-2dcadfdcb654"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Followers; Human approach test; Leader; Personality; Social behaviour; Sus scrofa"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060449726"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b4bedfdbe8318b4ca628d","name":"Léa","lastName":"Lansade","documentHash":"0d683252-4d2a-46a3-84d1-306f480e0d61"},{"objectId":"679b4bedfdbe8318b4ca628c","name":"Alexia","lastName":"Bret-Morel","documentHash":"068ae7e3-2e02-49e8-bff8-f817682518f4"},{"objectId":"679b4bedfdbe8318b4ca628b","name":"Alice","lastName":"Ruet","documentHash":"9bc3a009-e8ba-4a9a-be71-10410d07bdb5"},{"objectId":"679b4bedfdbe8318b4ca628a","name":"Noémie","lastName":"Hennes","documentHash":"b66bd9dc-fbc7-4add-b814-32a95a8900bd"},{"objectId":"679b4bedfdbe8318b4ca6289","name":"Romane","lastName":"Phelipon","documentHash":"7f6e4ff8-5ea4-4e94-876c-88d6781b8cda"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a047399792","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Górecka-Bruzda","uuid":"72F07386064F04FF4EAD4A68E0477EB2820848B4A1DA26E3EF48F8D21F704F6E420674366B7C4BA7D63499E807F6FA5DE0CB5CACD4982E5B9255599DE0881524","orcidId":"0000-0002-2770-2278","documentHash":"12a96cce-0775-4b1e-a45d-8a702583a7c3"}],"objectId":"679b4bedfdbe8318b4ca6288","doi":"10.3389/fvets.2024.1504116","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2024.1504116/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Forage, freedom of movement, and social interactions remain essential fundamentals for the welfare of high-level sport horses","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Societal concerns for animal welfare extend to all domestic species, including high-level sport horses. The welfare of these horses, notably highlighted during the recent Olympics, has garnered significant public interest, prompting inquiries into their living conditions. Animal welfare studies have emphasised three key needs crucial to equine welfare: unlimited access to forage, freedom of movement, and social interactions with peers, commonly referred to as the “3Fs”—access to Forage, Freedom of movement, and interactions with Friend conspecifics. However, the feasibility and benefits of satisfying these needs specifically for sport horses remain unexplored. Indeed, they may face unique challenges such as high physical workload, extensive travel, limited time in their home stables, weight management, and high economic value necessitating careful handling. Consequently, restrictions on feeding, freedom of movement, and social contact are often deemed necessary. This field study aims to assess the actual level of implementation of welfare in high-level sport horses by evaluating body condition, injury risk, and behavioural welfare indicators in their home stable. To achieve this objective, the welfare of 56 high-level sport horses competing internationally was assessed using behavioural indicators of welfare through scan sampling (abnormal behaviours, i.e., stereotypies, aggression towards humans, withdrawn behaviour, and alert behaviours; positions of the ears in a backward position while foraging, watching behaviours, and through other Animal Welfare Indicators (AWIN) protocol measures). This study shows that there exists a large variability among horses regarding their access to the 3Fs, with some of them having a lot of restrictions and others not, meaning it is possible to respect them while competing at a high level. Second, we observed that the fewer restrictions the horses experience regarding the 3Fs while in their home stables, the better their welfare, as demonstrated by the indicators we assessed. These results undeniably support the fact that unrestricted access to forage, the ability to move freely outdoors, and the opportunity to interact socially with conspecifics are fundamental needs of horses that could be provided to horses, also to high-performance ones. It is therefore essential that solutions are put in place to ensure that these conditions are met."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej

While minor bone defects may be capable of healing naturally, those of a critical size necessitate intervention through the use of implants or grafts. The utilization of traditional methodologies, encompassing autografts and allografts, is constrained by several factors. These include the potential for donor site morbidity, the restricted availability of suitable donors, and the possibility of immune rejection. This has prompted extensive research in the field of bone tissue engineering to develop advanced synthetic and bio-derived materials that can support bone regeneration. The optimal bone substitute must achieve a balance between biocompatibility, bioresorbability, osteoconductivity, and osteoinductivity while simultaneously providing mechanical support during the healing process. Recent innovations include the utilization of three-dimensional printing, nanotechnology, and bioactive coatings to create scaffolds that mimic the structure of natural bone and enhance cell proliferation and differentiation. Notwithstanding the advancements above, challenges remain in optimizing the controlled release of growth factors and adapting materials to various clinical contexts. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current advancements in bone substitute materials, focusing on their biological mechanisms, design considerations, and clinical applications. It explores the role of emerging technologies, such as additive manufacturing and stem cell-based therapies, in advancing the field. Future research highlights the need for multidisciplinary collaboration and rigorous testing to develop advanced bone graft substitutes, improving outcomes and quality of life for patients with

impact of BDNF and CD4 + T cell crosstalk on depression","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Depression represents a prevalent health concern since it affects approximately 350 million people of all ages worldwide [1, 2]. Both genders suffer from depression, albeit women are disproportionally affected by it more than men [3]. Notably, depression has the potential to impact individuals across various phases of their lifespan. Around 15% of adolescents aged 14 to 18 will encounter at least a single significant depressive episode [4]. Depression continues to be a concern within the elderly community. Namely, approximately 7% of individuals aged 60 and above experience symptoms of depression [5, 6]. These observations highlight that depression is pervasive in our society. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor’s (BDNF) role in depression is highly affected by various factors [7,8,9]. BDNF is a neurotrophin known for its roles in synaptic plasticity, dendritic spine morphology, cognitive function, and mood regulation [10,11,12,13,14]. BDNF polymorphisms, such as Val66met, can significantly influence an individual’s predisposition to depression [15,16,17,18,19,20]. Epigenetic alterations of BDNF, such as increase/decrease in DNA methylation at specific CpG sites, have recently emerged as relevant mechanisms promoting susceptibility to the development of depressive-like symptoms [21, 22]. These genetic and epigenetic factors are deeply intertwined with environmental influences, such as early-life experiences, social support, and exposure to stressors. Together, they contribute to the role of BDNF in the onset and progression of depression [23,24,25]. Recently, CD4 + T cells, a fundamental constituent of the adaptive immune system, have come under the attention of various research groups for their potential involvement in mediating neuroinflammatory processes that influence mood and cognition [26,27,28]. CD4 + T cells are a heterogeneous group of cells that include both pro- (e.g., Th1 and Th17) and anti-inflammatory cell types (e.g., Treg). CD4 + T cells can influence depression onset and development in various ways, including direct effects on neurons, astrocytes, and microglia through the production of cytokines and expressing receptors for molecules produced by brain cells [29,30,31,32,33]. BDNF seems to have a positive effect on CD4 + T cell proliferation and differentiation. However, our understanding of BDNF’s effects on each cell type remains limited. Surprisingly, IL-17, which is produced by pro-inflammatory Th17 cells, and IL-4, which is produced by anti-inflammatory Tregs, both seem to increase BDNF production by astrocytes. The reason behind this counterintuitive phenomenon remains unknown. This review aims to investigate the mechanisms of interaction between CD4 + T cells and BDNF in the context of depression to acquire a deeper understanding of depression and the development of more effective therapies. Therefore, we first cover the role of BDNF in depression, followed by discussing what is currently known about the role of CD4 + T cells in depression. After that, we explore the latest knowledge on the interaction between these two entities in the realm of depression."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e70929c878c28a047399193"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","uid":"b8lEq4e8f8p1V09_nBsO4Ew","uuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","name":"Akademia Bialska im.

forms of oxygen is hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), whichhas been investigated as a key component of growth processes and stressresponses. Different methods for the determination of H 2 O 2 production byanimal and bacterial cells exist; however, its detection in algal cell culturesis more complicated due to the presence of photosynthetic pigments in thecells and the complex structure of cell walls. Considering these issues, a reli-able, quick, and simple method for H 2 O 2 detection is needed in phycologicalresearch. The aim of this methodological study was to optimize an AmplexUltraRed method for the fluorometric detection of H 2 O 2 produced by microal-gae cells, using a wild-type strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model.The results showed that (i) potassium phosphate is the most suitable reactionbuffer for this method, (ii) a 560 nm wavelength variant is the most appro-priate as the excitation wavelength for fluorescence spectra measurement,(iii) a 50:50 ratio for the reaction mixture to sample was the most suitable,(iv) the fluorescence signal was significantly influenced by the density of themicroalgae biomass, and (v) sample fortification with H 2 O 2 allowed for an in-crease of the method's reliability and repeatability. The proposed protocol ofthe Amplex UltraRed method for the fluorometric detection of H 2 O 2 producedby microalgae cells can yield a sensitive and accurate determination of thecontent of the test compound, minimizing measurement errors, eliminatingchlorophyll autofluorescence problem, and compensating for the matrix ef-fect. This method can be applied to the study of other microalgae species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709249878c28a047393190"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60b88f909543c723365430aa"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"60","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1356-1370","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60b88f909543c723365430aa","6030d09d9543c7410626f961","5e709249878c28a047393190"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547899d","mniswId":"12281","title":"Journal of Phycology","issn":"0022-3646","eissn":"1529-8817","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"3cb6ee6c-5273-4fd4-b821-a53768c69b50"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hydrogenperoxide","Amplex UltraRed","Chlamydomonas reinhardtii","horseradish peroxidase","reactive oxygen species","microalgae","fortification"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060504940"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679a2ab3fdbe831aedccd573","name":"Simon P.","lastName":"Turner","documentHash":"c65a7202-d732-40a5-8c2b-03e26b1d5e21"},{"objectId":"63881fb975234052dad46638","name":"Piero","lastName":"Seddaiu","uuid":"1FE51164B80252D666D8E9BBEC5651FAAF8881C434E4E24EA97E86E2F1926325EFCB7C1A424292BE0B3B0B318E191124D55FAC35E9F789410E87E9A5C2BC4B38","documentHash":"1be60541-6565-46ac-a80b-06e21ea9e6e2"},{"objectId":"5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","name":"Irene","lastName":"Camerlink","uuid":"63511C46590F3B7E26AA60526C552EED8D9F0549F8DEE5333E681582883DA44BB38FF69E2CB85D2955FD7C17DC6CFA4F35E7BE97ABD84CE52B2422233F186398","documentHash":"21f3e447-93d1-4634-92b3-8aae9343fdc4"}],"objectId":"679a2ab3fdbe831aedccd571","doi":"10.1016/j.applanim.2024.106379","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0168159124002272?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Cross-seasonal and diurnal variation in physical contact between sub-adult pigs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Social touch is an important aspect of social relationships and has a major influence on development and health. However, in many species the occurrence and function of social touch is unknown. Pigs have frequent physical contact but this behaviour is largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate the undisturbed variation in physical contact between pigs, and to assess diurnal and seasonal influences. A stable group of ten Puławska sub-adult female pigs was observed for 406 h across four seasons during the day and night, by continuous observations on an individual level (406 h / pig). They were housed indoors (112 m2 pen) on straw bedding. The ethogram distinguished the amount of surface contact between pigs when lying, the orientation to others, social nosing, other non-agonistic social behaviour and agonistic behaviours. Resting location within the pen was recorded 48 times per pig, and dominance relationships were calculated from agonistic interactions. Data were analysed with mixed models accounting for repeated observations. Pigs spent on average 40 % of their time lying in body contact, most often lying with their extremities in contact (71 %), followed by lying in partial body contact (16 %) or full body contact (13 %) and were frequently nosing the head and body of others. The duration of lying in any type of contact, as well as agonistic behaviour, was influenced by season, with the longest durations in autumn. In summer, the duration of partial body contact was lowest, but full body contact was unaffected by season. Nosing behaviour remained constant throughout the year. Pigs lay in contact more during the night, while showing more social behaviours during the day. Pigs mostly lay in nonparallel orientation or head-to-head, but clearly least in the head-to-tail orientation. Season influenced the frequency of lying head-to-head and head-to-tail, but not lying nonparallel. The coefficient of variation of the lying location was influenced by season. Allo-grooming, mounting, and nudging were shown infrequently and mostly by specific individuals. In conclusion, when at a large space allowance, pigs spend nearly half of their time in body contact, even during the higher temperatures in summer. This shows that social touch, including affiliative behaviour, has an important role in pigs’ social life, and remains largely unaffected by external influences."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63881fb975234052dad46638","5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"278","pagesFromTo":"106379","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63881fb975234052dad46638","679a2ab3fdbe831aedccd573","5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477110","mniswId":"1437","title":"APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE","issn":"0168-1591","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"77846c4d-a8d9-4af5-9538-18edc65d2562"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679a2ab3fdbe831aedccd572","year":"2024","volume":"278","documentHash":"a38a675a-8308-4cde-a0d9-43a149b98058"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pigs; social touch; social nosing; physical contact; Sus scrofa domesticus"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060507868"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6799fdcdfdbe831aedc9abff","name":"Luciana","lastName":"Rossi","documentHash":"79318206-b8be-4ee8-9ed5-0c906f75711f"},{"objectId":"6799fdcdfdbe831aedc9abfe","name":"Michele","lastName":"Di Dio","documentHash":"465ec480-ce38-4c89-b54c-5cfa954ded3e"},{"objectId":"6799fdcdfdbe831aedc9abfd","name":"Maria Claudia","lastName":"Torresani","documentHash":"f3400f5c-0d72-489b-8486-4ce43c7b763b"},{"objectId":"6799fdcdfdbe831aedc9abfc","name":"Sara","lastName":"Frazzini","documentHash":"efccd5f0-c284-49f1-b238-8cc693bc4f6f"},{"objectId":"60b88f909543c723365430aa","name":"Monika","lastName":"Hejna","uuid":"63429F07634DE1979C510CB5643830F0FC1F4F06199E8400B5BF7254110623E150124C9EA0038F279BDBBC3653C506BF6A0D646C9E79BCF80686AF53512619FE","orcidId":"0000-0003-3427-9831","documentHash":"7782d01a-7043-43b8-98ae-7c12491a86c7"}],"objectId":"6799fdcdfdbe831aedc9abfa","doi":"10.1016/j.jff.2024.106257","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1756464624002597?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Ascophillum nodosum and Lithothamnium calcareum and their prebiotic potential on Lactobacillus strains","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Functional ingredients became essential for sustainable development to improve health status, prevent disease, and reduce the use of medication. This study aimed to determine the potential prebiotic role of Ascophyllum nodosum and Lithothamnium calcareum using Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Limosilactobacillus reuteri as microorganism models. Key bioactive compounds of algae were identified using LC-QTOF-MS/MS. The influence of algae inclusion on the growth of Lactobacilli strains was evaluated. Functional activities of the co-culture were evaluated after 24, 48, 72, and 96 incubation hours.

These marine organisms produce a variety of secondary metabolites that exhibit significant anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties, offering promising avenues for the development of new drugs and nutraceuticals. Algae-derived compounds, including polyphenols, carotenoids, lipids, and polysaccharides, have demonstrated efficacy in modulating key inflammatory pathways, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting microbial growth. At the molecular level, these compounds influence macrophage activity, suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and regulate apoptotic processes. Studies have shown that algae extracts can inhibit inflammatory signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK, reduce oxidative damage by activating Nrf2, and offer an alternative to traditional antibiotics by combatting bacterial infections. Furthermore, algae’s therapeutic potential extends to addressing diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, neurodegenerative conditions, and cancer, with ongoing research exploring their efficacy in preclinical animal models. The pig model, due to its physiological similarities to humans, is highlighted as particularly suitable for validating the bioactivities of algal compounds in vivo. This review underscores the need for further investigation into the specific mechanisms of action and clinical applications of algae-derived biomolecules."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a047399828","5f87bf6c085dcb410a25ef74","60b88f909543c723365430aa","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","671610cdece39836623b1eff"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"4695","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["671610cdece39836623b1eff","5f87bf6c085dcb410a25ef74","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","679a1b2ffdbe831aedcbbbcd","679a1b2ffdbe831aedcbbbce","60b88f909543c723365430aa","5e7092a1878c28a047399828"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":"10.3390/molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules","documentHash":"184d7608-03fd-4b64-ac86-b4321a9365f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f278d2fdbe8327371d5e09","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"29","number":"19","documentHash":"2b349d30-e26b-43d5-9351-dd5cd250d1f7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["anti-inflammatory; antioxidant; antimicrobial; micro and macroalgae; bioactive compounds; therapeutic applications 1.

It can cause acute pulmonary and systemic inflammation, which can lead to death in severely ill patients. This study explores the potential reasons behind severe COVID-19 and its similarities to systemic autoimmune diseases. This study reviewed unbiased high-throughput gene expression datasets, including next-generation and single-cell RNA sequencing. A total of 27 studies and eight meta-analyses were reviewed. The studies indicated that severe COVID-19 is associated with the upregulation of genes involved in pro-inflammatory, interferon, and cytokine/chemokine pathways. Additionally, changes were observed in the proportions of immune cell types in the blood and tissues, along with degenerative alterations in lung epithelial cells. Genomic evidence also supports the association of severe COVID-19 with various inflammatory syndromes, such as neuronal COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome, vascular inflammation, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome. In conclusion, this study suggests that gene expression profiling plays a significant role in elucidating the etiology of severe COVID-19."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c0878c28a0473c3159"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"3280","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094c0878c28a0473c3159"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eecec940970749973c2941","year":"2024","volume":"25","number":"6","documentHash":"7648d4d7-7de1-4551-9373-a4fc26d056e3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; RNA-seq; scRNA-seq; inflammation; pneumonia; neuronal COVID-19; acute respiratory distress syndrome; multisystem inflammatory syndrome"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060508700"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b38cdfdbe8318b4c954dc","name":"František","lastName":"Zigo","documentHash":"953891cb-6d1a-47f2-b4a9-3a2535f20464"},{"objectId":"679b38cdfdbe8318b4c954db","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Dadashbeiki","documentHash":"b867c9e1-1e24-4744-b7a8-2f5174aca038"},{"objectId":"679b38cdfdbe8318b4c954da","name":"Ross G.","lastName":"Cooper","documentHash":"cbe48432-21ed-456d-aa90-3606aa2e9f35"},{"objectId":"679b38cdfdbe8318b4c954d9","name":"Alireza","lastName":"Seidavi","documentHash":"f42f684b-84f8-4b81-a814-33988d7ac29d"},{"objectId":"679b38cdfdbe8318b4c954d8","name":"Majid","lastName":"Gholami-Soltanmoradi","documentHash":"e91115c9-8f9a-4708-bb44-427160fa4942"},{"objectId":"63881fb975234052dad46665","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Jaszczyk","uuid":"6F9183570EEF8A13FFB3B0980E4D63BFC38B702A6DDB1148D723147AA7EF55E20F6E47A486E2BB561878F690F45AF99E21F6ABCC770BCC05FD6A6162F5D7653C","documentHash":"d1dffe61-20d1-4db0-9ca0-4bb793f13190"},{"objectId":"60c334699543c723365440d7","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Sztandarski","uuid":"DB121ECB1867DCEE6DCDFE72BBFCB495A3B8319D29FC1110A9E66DA325C15BD3E61BC3DA535901104DB03EB52A2F9FAB2EC0DA3171D22CA03C987336A1169A15","orcidId":"0000-0003-1304-6780","documentHash":"d8d49d3c-0d8c-4213-a679-29abd438b564"},{"objectId":"5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Marchewka","uuid":"EC0F04392DD656A21DC052B59B1A2D8E5A03749BA0461B4AFF6E8CCF5C15DE33EA901A402324204CF8155923E33B80BE4DC420B7AA2054A864B93FC416AA4F24","orcidId":"0000-0002-9571-8677","documentHash":"77dd006d-9494-445c-b9e3-36c4addbec89"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a0473998b4","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Solka","uuid":"C84D179BD3A4F48607BDFD967DC14CAA9829D6A071CD038C1D50EDB7F259D3937080C700BAC1F79331F59F5BBA74D03970276E2690E33579AD02CA2C27713F28","orcidId":"0000-0003-1421-5400","documentHash":"9a872c7e-9fe1-4108-9d31-2c191937040d"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399193","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Horbańczuk","uuid":"976205AE9A3DD4FA85531EB44854AE0083FBAD6743C6797D800A9669BD6FAED38693031A6C16E0A03AAE6903DEB2CEF4B47FFF137CB5399DCB5BFBCFCFF25343","orcidId":"0000-0002-7561-0941","documentHash":"a9235661-fb2e-4102-b6a6-35060d6414c3"}],"objectId":"679b38cdfdbe8318b4c954d7","doi":"10.1016/j.psj.2024.104307","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0032579124008861?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Feeding frequency can affect the morphology of reproductive tract in broiler breeder hens","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study examined the influence of feeding frequency on the morphology of the reproductive tract in broiler breeder hens, with a focus on the liver, ovary, and oviduct.

These findings suggesting complex interactions between feeding practices and reproductive efficiency."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63881fb975234052dad46665","5e7092a1878c28a0473998b4","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","60c334699543c723365440d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"103","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"104307","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679b38cdfdbe8318b4c954d8","5e7092a1878c28a0473998b4","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","679b38cdfdbe8318b4c954d9","679b38cdfdbe8318b4c954da","679b38cdfdbe8318b4c954db","679b38cdfdbe8318b4c954dc","60c334699543c723365440d7","63881fb975234052dad46665","5e70929c878c28a047399193"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547934f","mniswId":"16421","title":"POULTRY SCIENCE","issn":"0032-5791","documentHash":"811483b7-60e4-4554-a4b1-68c7cbbfdd17"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fbe234fdbe837a1e1bab29","year":"2024","volume":"103","number":"12","documentHash":"cc35f5ad-18bd-4bd1-9b06-1b46e592f76a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["feeding frequency; ovarian follicle; ovary; liver; broiler breeder hen"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060511752"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673216f0fdbe8303494067d1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Rzewuska","documentHash":"81cbeeb4-b492-495f-a5ea-03f8756f9c7c"},{"objectId":"673216f0fdbe8303494067d0","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Kaba","documentHash":"95dc4c92-9457-4fd2-a73b-4f291c7f1a62"},{"objectId":"673216f0fdbe8303494067ce","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Biernacka","documentHash":"ade03c31-98de-417f-bbdf-64a0eb166389"},{"objectId":"673216f0fdbe8303494067cd","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Mickiewicz","documentHash":"c6adb26c-93df-4d30-bd3a-5c70bbca6ed6"},{"objectId":"673216f0fdbe8303494067cc","name":"Agata","lastName":"Moroz-Fik","documentHash":"c86a4321-f8d0-4a89-b1fd-c8f848e886ac"},{"objectId":"673216f0fdbe8303494067cb","name":"Michał","lastName":"Czopowicz","documentHash":"19c3b13d-15c9-464a-8a29-d62cdaea4a0f"},{"objectId":"673216f0fdbe8303494067ca","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Chrobak-Chmiel","documentHash":"b5cf375a-372c-490f-b9f2-819b49bafb8e"},{"objectId":"673216f0fdbe8303494067c9","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kizerwetter-Świda","documentHash":"d6f7b4ab-4e87-4e72-a5e2-a887806d410f"},{"objectId":"673216f0fdbe8303494067c8","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Kwiecień","documentHash":"078cd91d-3e0b-4385-b13a-ceb706867062"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af795","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Stefańska","uuid":"33E3122A98CCF585E8F083E9F9B49797D3A3A83D735F8CD0ADB9D33FCCEF9A0458E49736DFAAF6F00317D6A9DD52A276D3AD2F4F22450623DFC9D0FBE5209537","orcidId":"0000-0001-7832-4548","documentHash":"b9e7b219-114e-425b-b442-d88885b55618"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a04739966f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Bagnicka","uuid":"0D37A8BCF2F4D93F59FC1D87DBDADCE868EF14AFD99EBF96C877CC86963C73AE2E470CED6B83A3F731B3B08724BDCE11D9A8CE8A0CE7E36513995F6A5C4D000D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7193-2006","documentHash":"a42098e0-b6d5-4d75-b67b-2d9b112c9c92"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"673216f0fdbe8303494067c7","doi":"10.1186/s12917-024-04262-x","publicUri":"https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-024-04262-x","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Genetic diversity and virulence properties of caprine Trueperella pyogenes isolates","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\nTrueperella pyogenes is an opportunistic pathogen that causes suppurative infections in various animal species, including goats. So far, only limited knowledge of phenotypic and genotypic properties of T. pyogenes isolates from goats has been gathered. In our study, we characterized the phenotypic and genotypic properties of caprine T. pyogenes isolates and established their relationship by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RAPD-PCR).\nResults\nFrom 2015 to 2023, 104 T. pyogenes isolates were obtained from 1146 clinical materials. In addition, two T. pyogenes isolates were obtained from 306 swabs collected from healthy goats. A total of 51 T. pyogenes isolates were subjected to detailed phenotypic and genotypic characterization. The virulence genotype plo/nanH/nanP/fimA/fimC/luxS was predominant. All of the tested isolates showed the ability to form a biofilm but with different intensities, whereby most of them were classified as strong biofilm formers (72.5%). The high level of genetic diversity among tested caprine T. pyogenes isolates (19 different RAPD profiles) was observed. The same RAPD profiles were found for isolates obtained from one individual, as well as from other animals in the same herd, but also in various herds.\nConclusions\nThis study provided important data on the occurrence of T. pyogenes infections in goats. The assessment of virulence properties and genetic relationships of caprine T. pyogenes isolates contributed to the knowledge of the epidemiology of infections caused by this pathogen in small ruminants. Nevertheless, further investigations are warranted to clarify the routes of transmission and dissemination of the pathogen."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["673216f0fdbe8303494067ca","673216f0fdbe8303494067cb","673216f0fdbe8303494067d0","673216f0fdbe8303494067d1","673216f0fdbe8303494067c9","5e7093b5878c28a0473af795","673216f0fdbe8303494067c8","673216f0fdbe8303494067ce","673216f0fdbe8303494067cc","673216f0fdbe8303494067cd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929f878c28a04739966f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"1-12","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673216f0fdbe8303494067c8","5e7093b5878c28a0473af795","673216f0fdbe8303494067c9","673216f0fdbe8303494067ca","673216f0fdbe8303494067cb","673216f0fdbe8303494067cc","673216f0fdbe8303494067cd","673216f0fdbe8303494067ce","5e70929f878c28a04739966f","673216f0fdbe8303494067d0","673216f0fdbe8303494067d1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773ef","mniswId":"2654","title":"BMC Veterinary Research","issn":"1746-6148","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"04278d28-b07c-4905-b172-e9426e37129a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Goats","Trueperella pyogenes","Virulence genotypes","Biofilm","Genetic diversity","RAPD‑PCR"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060511857"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e89","name":"Liudmil","lastName":"Antonov","documentHash":"ac11e258-0a55-4e54-9dbd-05e0f654e9f9"},{"objectId":"679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e88","name":"Hans-Georg","lastName":"Stammler","documentHash":"19127eb1-8e3b-4bfe-b68a-f45005807e88"},{"objectId":"679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e87","name":"Kiril","lastName":"Kirilov","documentHash":"ecc33c2c-135f-4957-b2bf-a5414d6d9fb7"},{"objectId":"679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e86","name":"Luigi","lastName":"Milella","documentHash":"be81e373-0b93-45a5-b7b2-ce031dcb2b6a"},{"objectId":"679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e85","name":"Maria","lastName":"Ponticelli","documentHash":"39029637-9719-4b17-bb23-f92ce206319e"},{"objectId":"679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e84","name":"Ivan P.","lastName":"Bogdanov","documentHash":"0396a51d-2d7d-46bf-bb77-13b193775486"},{"objectId":"679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e83","name":"Aneliya A.","lastName":"Balacheva","documentHash":"ad232ed8-6f84-4fc6-a55a-b898ce4cecc3"},{"objectId":"679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e82","name":"Vera","lastName":"Deneva","documentHash":"ed259557-fc61-4acf-83fa-619a42914dec"},{"objectId":"679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e81","name":"Maya G.","lastName":"Georgieva","documentHash":"f4823e98-e591-470d-be11-56f63bbd0500"},{"objectId":"679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e80","name":"Martina I.","lastName":"Peeva","documentHash":"06943d35-af75-4b66-a109-d6836f865f02"},{"objectId":"679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e7f","name":"Nikolay T.","lastName":"Tzvetkov","documentHash":"5a0d72fc-8f82-4c0a-bf62-9855e9bfb608"},{"objectId":"671610cdece39836623b1eff","name":"Maima","lastName":"Matin","uuid":"028B8E8EDCF7D67A78E16C226F937DAAC626533E030CC2CD79DF049C5F6AC008ED2C671E37A5912CDF0CC34E742667D43D8854F7413AC6FB857EBF57B01E355C","documentHash":"52857f92-cb97-439c-860d-0d296c5467a7"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e7e","doi":"10.1016/j.crbiot.2024.100176","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2590262824000029?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Favipiravir vs. Deferiprone: Tautomeric, photophysical, in vitro biological studies, and binding interactions with SARS-Cov-2-MPro/ACE2","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) still remains the most disastrous infection continuously affecting millions of people worldwide. Herein, we performed a comparative study between the anti-influenza drug favipiravir (FAV) and the anti-thalassemia drug deferiprone (DFP) in order to examine their potential as basic scaffolds for the generation of most effective and structurally novel antivirals. To conduct the initial molecular modelling and virtual screening steps, our recently proposed single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD)/HYdrogen DEssolvation (HYDE) technology platform has been used. This platform allows molecular design, interactive prioritization and virtual evaluation of newly designed molecules, simultaneously affecting two COVID-related targets, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host-cellular receptor (host-based approach) and the main protease (Mpro) enzyme of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-Cov-2 (virus-based approach). Based on the molecular docking results, DFP has shown higher binding affinity (Ki HYDE values) over FAV towards both biological targets. The tautomeric, physicochemical, and biological properties of FAV and DFP have been studied both experimentally and theoretically using molecular spectroscopy (UV–VIS absorption), parallel artificial membrane permeability assay, and cell biology (PAMPA and MTT assay), as well as DFT quantum chemical calculations. According to the obtained results, the enol tautomers of both compounds are considerably more stable in different organic solvents. However, the keto tautomer of FAV was estimated to be most preferable under physiological conditions, which is in good agreement with the molecular docking studies. The isolated crystal structure of DFP is in an excellent agreement with the computation in respect of the most stable tautomer. Combined single X-ray/molecular modeling studies including HYDE analyses provided not only insights into the protein–ligand interactions within the binding site of SARS-Cov-2-ACE2 and SARS-Cov-2-Mpro, but also a valuable information regarding the most stable enol tautomeric form of DFP that contributes to its estimated higher potency against these targets."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","671610cdece39836623b1eff"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","pagesFromTo":"100176","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e7f","679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e80","679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e81","679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e82","679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e83","679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e84","679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e85","679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e86","679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e87","671610cdece39836623b1eff","679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e88","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","679b3536fdbe8318b4c92e89"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb8b0","mniswId":"30244","title":"Current Research in Biotechnology","eissn":"2590-2628","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c41bc635-e91a-4cae-a581-ffd8f9bb20bb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"660ba69440970773c9ac828f","year":"2024","volume":"7","documentHash":"166abf22-7738-4ffc-8f2b-7a11d61a51e8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Favipiravir; Deferiprone; Tautomer-based drug design; COVID-19; Molecular modelling; Tautomerism"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060512005"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd340e","name":"Anne","lastName":"Vejux","documentHash":"09402009-0e1d-4bd8-ac67-317e5f30387c"},{"objectId":"679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd340d","name":"Gérard","lastName":"Lizard","documentHash":"0c6010eb-4c2b-4d14-8619-474d584fe85e"},{"objectId":"679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd340c","name":"Amira","lastName":"Zarrouk","documentHash":"5f844275-443f-405f-8443-8784ee64d4aa"},{"objectId":"679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd340b","name":"Vivien","lastName":"Pires","documentHash":"cc080461-15c7-4da5-b4dc-340a7983cbbe"},{"objectId":"679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd340a","name":"Valerio","lastName":"Leoni","documentHash":"b573124a-7d0c-4b6e-bc80-f80b871b12bb"},{"objectId":"679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd3409","name":"Claudio","lastName":"Caccia","documentHash":"c870ac65-90b6-411e-870c-a2944ec412f6"},{"objectId":"679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd3408","name":"Aziz","lastName":"Hichami","documentHash":"429cabb7-facd-4ea3-be94-2b1e5a545c89"},{"objectId":"679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd3407","name":"Imen","lastName":"Ghzaiel","documentHash":"0205cf34-42ac-4b25-90cc-7d864c3bf552"},{"objectId":"679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd3406","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Nury","documentHash":"c931e3cf-839d-4217-8d4e-d88ea0840ecf"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd3405","doi":"10.1016/j.crbiot.2024.100195","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2590262824000212?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Lipid droplets dependent or independent cytoprotective activities of unsaturated fatty acids, Lorenzo’s oil and sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate on 7-ketocholesterol-induced oxidative stress, organelle dysfunction and cell death on 158N and ARPE-19 cells: Cell targets and benefits of sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"7-ketocholesterol is a cytotoxic oxysterol which is frequently increased in many chronic inflammatory and age-related diseases. Thus, the inhibition of the toxicity of 7-ketocholesterol is a major challenge to treat these diseases. 158N oligodendrocytes were used to evaluate the cytoprotective effects of lipids: ω-3 and ω-9 fatty acids (α-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3), erucic acid (C22:1n-9) and oleic acid (C18:1n-9)), Lorenzo's oil (a mixture of oleic and erucic acid, 4:1) and sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO, a synthetic derivative of oleic acid). On 158N cells, the ability of these molecules to inhibit 7KC-induced oxiapoptophagy (plasma membrane alteration, loss of ΔΨm, peroxisomal dysfunction, reactive oxygen species overproduction, induction of apoptosis and autophagy) were determined. ARPE-19 epithelial retinal cells were also used to evaluate the cytoprotective effect of SSO on 7KC-induced cell death. Unlike ω-3 and ω-9 fatty acids and Lorenzo's oil, sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate had no cytotoxic effects over a wide range of concentrations. Noteworthy, unlike fatty acids and Lorenzo's oil, the cytoprotective effects of sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate on 7KC-induced oxiapoptophagy, a caspase-dependent mode of cell death on 158N cells, were not associated with an accumulation of lipid droplets. In addition, on ARPE-19 cells, sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate prevented 7KC-induced oxidative stress and cell death. These different characteristics of SSO make it possible to envisage its use for therapeutic purposes in diseases where 7-ketocholesterol levels are increased without eventual secondary side effects due to lipid droplets formation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","pagesFromTo":"100195","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd3406","679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd3407","679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd3408","679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd3409","679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd340a","679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd340b","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd340c","679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd340d","679b6d51fdbe8318b4cd340e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb8b0","mniswId":"30244","title":"Current Research in Biotechnology","eissn":"2590-2628","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c41bc635-e91a-4cae-a581-ffd8f9bb20bb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"660ba69440970773c9ac828f","year":"2024","volume":"7","documentHash":"166abf22-7738-4ffc-8f2b-7a11d61a51e8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["7-ketocholesterol;

The animals (rats) were divided into 7 experimental groups. The groups differed in the concentration of pomegranate juice administered. The control group received only water, the other groups were supplied with commercial or freshly squeezed pomegranate juice at concentrations of 10%, 25% and 50%. To study the structure of the proximal end of the tibia, a Skyscan 1174 X-ray microtomography device, equipped with a 1.3Mp FW VDS camera, was used. The proximal end (metaphysis) of the left tibia was examined. The following bone tissue parameters were analysed: bone mineral density (BMD) (mm3), the number of trabeculae (Tb.N) (mm-1), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) (mm) and trabecular thickness (Tb. Th) (mm), BS/BV(mm-1). It was found that 25% pomegranate juice, both freshly squeezed and commercial, significantly increased bone density (BMD), increased trabecular thickness (Tb.TH), and reduced the distance between trabeculae (Tb.SP) compared to the control group and groups receiving juice at other concentrations. The highest BMD, the thickest trabeculae and the smallest distance between trabeculae were observed after the application of fresh 25% pomegranate juice. Thus, it can be concluded that pomegranate juice, especially freshly squeezed, improves bone density."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923a878c28a047392135"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a047399828","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"42","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"173-188","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67323be1fdbe83034949bd0a","67323be1fdbe83034949bd0c","67323be1fdbe83034949bd0d","67323be1fdbe83034949bd0e","67323be1fdbe83034949bd0f","67323be1fdbe83034949bd10","67323be1fdbe83034949bd11","67323be1fdbe83034949bd12","5e70923a878c28a047392135","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e7092a1878c28a047399828","5e70929c878c28a047399193"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547703a","mniswId":"1152","title":"Animal Science Papers and Reports","issn":"0860-4037","eissn":"2300-8342","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"fe90747c-1196-49b0-9210-8098e8db0aa8"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["anatomy / bone development / histomorphometry /\nBMD / pomegranate juice / animal model"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060515056"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679ca4fdfdbe830b35f97045","name":"Jonathan R.","lastName":"Amory","documentHash":"fc683713-a4e6-437f-a578-69a2d0fb4310"},{"objectId":"679ca4fdfdbe830b35f97044","name":"Zoe E.","lastName":"Barker","documentHash":"4c251041-9cff-4b6c-bc63-8fe2999de0d7"},{"objectId":"63881fb975234052dad4664e","name":"Sarah","lastName":"Jowett","uuid":"12B80FE06B9B577A89611F1C55B2C4B49AC4D0E2D40F63A7E674D04320D024E855F2EE14C0E394A2B076DCAC6FB8B0293DE288FFA67DE534F1DBF40B48191963","documentHash":"53c4ddcb-16f1-42fb-a015-fa267a81018e"}],"objectId":"679ca4fdfdbe830b35f97043","doi":"10.1016/j.applanim.2024.106376","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0168159124002247?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The effect of preferential associations on the reproductive performance of group-housed sows","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The investigation of social bonds as a measure to improve reproduction in farmed species is an underrepresented research area. This study investigated the effects of preferential associations between group housed sows (average herd size, n = 59) on stillborn and crushed piglet numbers. Preferential associations were described as resting within < 1 m of a conspecific in which the proximity was tolerated > 60 s. The study occurred over 63 consecutive days, broken down into three 21-day periods referred to as cycles. The 21-day cycles represent the time between reintegrating events. Seven days per cycle were selected for observations providing 63 h of footage covering the functional areas of the barn. Production data were taken from one farrowing that occurred after a sow had been transferred from the barn to the farrowing house during the study period. For group-level analysis, the sows were categorised as socially prominent or non-socially prominent. Social prominence is defined as an individual that engages in significantly higher levels of interactions than their sub-group conspecifics. The subgroups were determined by our previous work that identified assortment by social connectivity within the same study herd. Each subgroup was defined as a k-core, in which the k-value represents the level of connectivity of those in the group (i.e., subgroup K1 means sows are connecting with at least one other conspecific). For individual-level analysis, sows were categorised as a sow with stillborn (at least one stillborn piglet) or a sow without stillborn (no stillborn piglets) and as a crushing sow (at least one crushed piglet) or a non-crushing sow (no crushed piglets). Degree centrality was applied to determine the number of interactions that individuals initiated and received. Results showed no overall effects of social prominence on live-born piglets (p = 0.436). Socially prominent sows demonstrated a lower mean rate of stillborn than non-socially prominent sows. Sows with stillborn had significantly lower degree centrality than sows without stillborn (p < 0.05). The numbers of crushed piglets between socially prominent and non-socially prominent sows were variable with crushing sows demonstrating significantly higher degree centrality than non-crushing sows (p < 0.05). Overall, the evidence does not provide a clear relationship between social prominence during gestation and the reproductive outputs of sows.

One of them, C. pecorum, is a globally endemic livestock pathogen. Despite its endemicity, prevalence data from Poland have so far been limited. The present study aimed to obtain insight into the chlamydiae prevalence in Polish dairy cattle.\nMaterial and Methods\nA screening of chlamydial seroprevalence in dairy cattle was initially performed, followed by Chlamydiaceae- and species-specific real-time qPCR. Vaginal swabs (n = 239) and placenta samples (n = 2) from seropositive animals in 142 herds were collected to detect shedders. The study population consisted of cows (n = 2,780) from dairy herds (n = 1,153) located in all Polish voivodeships.\nResults\nThe true animal prevalence was determined to be 33.3%, while the true herd prevalence was 42.7%. Five groups of Polish voivodeships were identified using appropriate statistical tools, highlighting differences that may arise from various factors impacting the spread of chlamydial infections.

Emerging evidence suggests that mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts brain development. To gain mechanistic insights into the neurodevelopmental impact of human mHTT, we engineered male induced pluripotent stem cells to introduce a biallelic or monoallelic mutant 70Q expansion or to remove the poly-Q tract of HTT. The introduction of a 70Q mutation caused aberrant development of cerebral organoids with loss of neural progenitor organization. The early neurodevelopmental signature of mHTT highlighted the dysregulation of the protein coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2), a transcription factor involved in mitochondrial integrated stress response. CHCHD2 repression was associated with abnormal mitochondrial morpho-dynamics that was reverted upon overexpression of CHCHD2.

The field experiments were conducted in three farms:\nZimna Woda (experiment I), Racibory (experiment II), and Ranna (experiment III). The measures to improve\npermanent grassland (PG) were carried out after the second cut in 2016 and in spring 2017. The effectiveness of both\nmethods was evaluated based on changes in the botanical composition of the sward and the yield of total protein and\nsoluble sugars (Preś and Rogalski, 1997). Positive effects of both methods on the floristic composition were achieved in\n2017 in all meadow habitats on mineral soils: brown soils formed from loamy sand (Zimna Woda), proper brown soils\n(Racibory) on light and medium loam, and alluvial soils on light loam (Ranna). Despite adverse pluvial and thermal\nconditions, both methods improved the utility value of the sward, increasing the yields of dry matter, protein, and\nsoluble sugars in subsequent years. The study showed that improving the state of PG by overseeding with diploid\nand tetraploid grass varieties and legume plants is effective, with its level of effectiveness depending on the pluvial and\nthermal conditions after treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","uid":"br7hcJFLf6iH-raneJQQ4Eg","uuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","name":"Instytut Technologiczno-Przyrodniczy - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947c878c28a0473be20f","5e709409878c28a0473b546c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","parentUuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","rootUuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"91-101","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709409878c28a0473b546c","5e70947c878c28a0473be20f","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a0a5","mniswId":"24534","title":"Journal of Water and Land Development","issn":"1429-7426","eissn":"2083-4535","websiteLink":"http://www.itp.edu.pl/wydawnictwo/journal","documentHash":"32118440-45d0-4449-88f7-e2303ab01546"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a69815409707136ffd99c4","year":"2024","documentHash":"a440a56c-e547-4d4c-a9da-0073cb484ef6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dry matter yield, effects of overseeding","hardwood meadows","evaluation of botanical composition","protein","soluble sugars"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060573057"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d56","name":"Monika","lastName":"Szymańska - Czerwińska","uuid":"E07CADA3BDAD828B11D62CEBC4FE77CCF81E33CFCE3A9704EF50F3519D3C3BCC13BA152ACABB83FC29A7C80274C453312953EC94D4928898C8078EA038CDC1CD","orcidId":"0000-0001-8974-0870","documentHash":"3114978b-eee1-4e88-802f-7d034c581f01"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Niemczuk","uuid":"82AA2E7CCF0C6F87FC9C29C9C294AC35E29D444F944ED9F1FA82BB7FF88B5C2DF9A8411764C95A57F695D0609991E5125471404AD969DADA833F258105E54B44","orcidId":"0000-0003-1611-9770","documentHash":"a1f14ea1-835c-4507-ba6c-be8782ab8fbd"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a77f","name":"Nina","lastName":"Strzałkowska","uuid":"313CB7F00A75E24B6B745074B5CE1B2BAD9989A1F5EA4987437A420F0635FA4685BDF30972166C85061836E6D4B38F0570CC97B8E939FD6C77EA4440E9C64FB2","orcidId":"0000-0002-5713-2835","documentHash":"302cdef6-27c1-48d9-a77d-4659d9d8f98e"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a047399828","name":"Artur","lastName":"Jóżwik","uuid":"BFBE241DDF4B149570AA3703800A25F0CDE93B1C4264239BABF6DF15004F8A1C786FFD25EEBC56546FCC94E0822AD59D94E422B8D8723F693AD042AB30FBBC43","orcidId":"0000-0001-5546-9891","documentHash":"9b809847-eb52-4086-95d8-3c676abd8ef9"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739228b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wierzbicka","uuid":"B0DDE44760A24226E4305C616289112453E9EC132DFA6F00E0894A86B7405F22A4A2EBA701343A0E1B561FC95399D36295B388AE3233A9276C697969DCF8F290","orcidId":"0000-0002-5770-4573","documentHash":"27d4f042-4168-4ed2-85a4-49da76166ba4"}],"objectId":"6799f94bfdbe831aedc969a4","doi":"10.2478/aspr-2023-0033","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/aspr-2023-0033","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Apple pomace in feeding of dairy cattle as an element of sustainable agriculture strategy - a review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This work provides an overview of the knowledge about using apple pomace as milk cattle feed.

Medicine-and-food homology plants contain a diverse set of natural bioactive compounds with promising development potential. This study screened and identified potent pancreatic lipase inhibitors from 20 commonly consumed medicine-and-food homology plants using affinity ultrafiltration combined with spectroscopy and docking simulations. The results showed that turmeric exhibited the highest pancreatic lipase-inhibitory activity, and curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin were discovered to be potent pancreatic lipase inhibitors within the turmeric extract, with IC50 values of 0.52 ± 0.04, 1.12 ± 0.05, and 3.30 ± 0.08 mg/mL, respectively. In addition, the enzymatic kinetics analyses demonstrated that the inhibition type of the three curcuminoids was the reversible competitive model, and curcumin exhibited a higher binding affinity and greater impact on the secondary structure of pancreatic lipase than found with demethoxycurcumin or bisdemethoxycurcumin, as observed through fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. Furthermore, docking simulations supported the above experimental findings, and revealed that the three curcuminoids might interact with amino acid residues in the binding pocket of pancreatic lipase through non-covalent actions, such as hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking, thereby inhibiting the pancreatic lipase. Collectively, these findings suggest that the bioactive compounds of turmeric, in particular curcumin, can be promising dietary pancreatic lipase inhibitors for the prevention and management of obesity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","671610cdece39836623b1eff"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"15","pagesFromTo":"2566","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679a3084fdbe831aedcd8b8e","679a3084fdbe831aedcd8b8f","679a3084fdbe831aedcd8b90","679a3084fdbe831aedcd8b91","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","679a3084fdbe831aedcd8b92","679a3084fdbe831aedcd8b93","679a3084fdbe831aedcd8b94","671610cdece39836623b1eff","679a3084fdbe831aedcd8b95","679a3084fdbe831aedcd8b96","679a3084fdbe831aedcd8b97"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","issn":"2072-6643","eissn":"2072-6643","documentHash":"66793415-2acd-4481-8264-119c658e1575"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66a74e97fdbe834a4ae6709c","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"15","documentHash":"711aa218-bbdb-47db-b322-c4aa1a61c47d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["medicine-and-food homology plants; pancreatic lipase; enzyme inhibition; affinity ultrafiltration; docking simulations"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060575703"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6799e9e0fdbe831aedc88bd3","name":"Dongdong","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"d15b028c-4a8f-42eb-a852-d1e0b5536ec0"},{"objectId":"6799e9e0fdbe831aedc88bd2","name":"Xiaomu","lastName":"Zhu","documentHash":"986cf237-0be4-4d3d-a17e-3e093a2d4889"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"6799e9e0fdbe831aedc88bd0","doi":"10.1016/j.crbiot.2024.100259","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2590262824000856?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A review: Anti-obesity drug discovery from natural plant metabolites and endogenous peptides","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Obesity is a condition of abnormal or excessive body fat accumulation. It is a chronic and degenerative disease that is a global health problem and causes large societal and economic burdens. However, until now, long-term pharmacotherapies to lower body weight to normal along with suitable tolerability and fewer side effects have remained a challenge. Natural products from plants are a promising source for new lead structures for drug discovery. Additionally, endogenous natural peptides have attracted increasing attention for fighting obesity recently. In this review, we first summarize recent findings on promising signaling/targets for managing body weight, including inhibition of appetite, nutrient absorption and energy expenditure. We also discuss pure natural compounds (such as betulinic acid) and endogenous peptides (such as GLP1, amylin, GIP, ghrelin) and their derivatives (such as orlistat) with anti-obesity effects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","pagesFromTo":"100259","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6799e9e0fdbe831aedc88bd2","6799e9e0fdbe831aedc88bd3","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb8b0","mniswId":"30244","title":"Current Research in Biotechnology","eissn":"2590-2628","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c41bc635-e91a-4cae-a581-ffd8f9bb20bb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6799e9e0fdbe831aedc88bd1","year":"2024","volume":"8","documentHash":"d0b716fa-f0f7-409d-9d51-2b6af6672754"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Diabetes; Appetite; Nutrient absorption; Energy expenditure; GLP1; GIP"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060575859"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b2ac9fdbe8318b4c8e3b4","name":"Farhan Bin","lastName":"Matin","documentHash":"d0ce03a2-9d01-40e8-8414-0aa862dd373a"},{"objectId":"679b2ac9fdbe8318b4c8e3b3","name":"Nikolay T.","lastName":"Tzvetkov","documentHash":"7a20c8e4-4ed5-4772-8eb9-152ca01e4f94"},{"objectId":"679b2ac9fdbe8318b4c8e3b2","name":"Dongdong","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"3e9d0a4a-a35f-49c1-9afe-f8eea9d17dc6"},{"objectId":"679b2ac9fdbe8318b4c8e3b1","name":"Tanuj","lastName":"Joshi","documentHash":"470cb0f7-c70f-4630-9906-45a409692dd4"},{"objectId":"671610cdece39836623b1eff","name":"Maima","lastName":"Matin","uuid":"028B8E8EDCF7D67A78E16C226F937DAAC626533E030CC2CD79DF049C5F6AC008ED2C671E37A5912CDF0CC34E742667D43D8854F7413AC6FB857EBF57B01E355C","documentHash":"52857f92-cb97-439c-860d-0d296c5467a7"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a047399828","name":"Artur","lastName":"Jóżwik","uuid":"BFBE241DDF4B149570AA3703800A25F0CDE93B1C4264239BABF6DF15004F8A1C786FFD25EEBC56546FCC94E0822AD59D94E422B8D8723F693AD042AB30FBBC43","orcidId":"0000-0001-5546-9891","documentHash":"9b809847-eb52-4086-95d8-3c676abd8ef9"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399193","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Horbańczuk","uuid":"976205AE9A3DD4FA85531EB44854AE0083FBAD6743C6797D800A9669BD6FAED38693031A6C16E0A03AAE6903DEB2CEF4B47FFF137CB5399DCB5BFBCFCFF25343","orcidId":"0000-0002-7561-0941","documentHash":"a9235661-fb2e-4102-b6a6-35060d6414c3"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739228b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wierzbicka","uuid":"B0DDE44760A24226E4305C616289112453E9EC132DFA6F00E0894A86B7405F22A4A2EBA701343A0E1B561FC95399D36295B388AE3233A9276C697969DCF8F290","orcidId":"0000-0002-5770-4573","documentHash":"27d4f042-4168-4ed2-85a4-49da76166ba4"}],"objectId":"679b2ac9fdbe8318b4c8e3b0","doi":"10.3390/biom14080940","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/14/8/940/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Effects of Ginger (Zingiber officinale) on the Hallmarks of Aging","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) is broadly used as a traditional remedy and food ingredient, and numerous preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated health benefits in a range of age-related disorders.

The reviewed literature supports the favorable effects of ginger and some of its constituents on all twelve hallmarks of aging, with a particularly high number of animal research studies indicating counteraction of nutrient-sensing dysregulations, mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and dysbiosis. On this background, validation in human clinical trials is still insufficient or is entirely missing, with the exception of some studies indicating positive effects on deregulated nutrient-sensing, chronic inflammation, and dysbiosis. Thus, the existing body of literature clearly supports the potential of ginger to be further studied in clinical trials as a supplement for the promotion of both lifespan and health span."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a047399828","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e70923d878c28a04739228b","671610cdece39836623b1eff"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"940","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["671610cdece39836623b1eff","679b2ac9fdbe8318b4c8e3b1","679b2ac9fdbe8318b4c8e3b2","679b2ac9fdbe8318b4c8e3b3","679b2ac9fdbe8318b4c8e3b4","5e70923d878c28a04739228b","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e7092a1878c28a047399828"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bb75","mniswId":"2511","title":"BIOMOLECULES","issn":"2218-273X","eissn":"2218-273X","documentHash":"082af85b-4e0b-4366-8d22-3e6d94f1ecbe"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66ab3088fdbe832e1e9b6076","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"8","documentHash":"e81ffb6f-dacd-49fd-8f83-0614fbc50b34"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ginger;

Several genome-wide association studies have linked a polymorphism (rs136067046, BTA19: g.50775172 C>G on ARS-UCD1.2) located in the upstream region of FASN (encoding fatty acid synthase) to milk fat traits in dairy cattle (Cai et al., 2020; Sanchez et al., 2019; Tribout et al., 2020). For example, Cai and collaborators showed that rs136067046 is associated to milk fat traits in Nordic Holstein cows. FASN is an enzyme that plays a critical role in de novo fatty acid synthesis in milk. Interestingly, rs136067046 is located within an ATAC peak (chr.19: 50 773 523–50 795 886) found in the mammary gland (Yuan et al., 2023). It is thus possible that rs136067046 is a functional variant that directly impacts these traits.\n\nThe ability of this SNP to alter transcription factor binding sites was then predicted with a custom script, as previously described (Ramírez-Ayala et al., 2021). This analysis suggests that rs136067046 modifies the binding sites of nine transcription factors (Table 1). Five of those transcription factors are expressed (transcript per million reads ≥0.5) in mammary gland tissue (Fang et al., 2020). Interestingly, three of those five transcription factors are from the Krüppel-like factor (KLF) family, a conserved class of transcription factors. It has been shown that KLF4 promotes milk fat synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells by targeting the FASN promoter region (Wu et al., 2024). The authors have shown, using yeast one-hybrid assay, that KLF4 interacts directly with a part of the FASN promoter region, encompassing the location of rs136067046. It has also been shown that KLF5 controls the expression of FASN through an interaction with SREBBP-1 (Lee et al., 2009). In addition, inactivation of KLF6 in bovine mammary epithelial cells increases FASN expression (Iqbal et al., 2022). These studies point to the important role played by these KLF transcription factors in the regulation of FASN. All these findings suggest that, consequently, rs136067046 is potentially a regulatory variant that might alter the expression of FASN."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c5878c28a0473c35de"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"55","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"907-909","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679b57ecfdbe8318b4cb67f9","679b57ecfdbe8318b4cb67fa","679b57ecfdbe8318b4cb67fb","679b57ecfdbe8318b4cb67fc","679b57ecfdbe8318b4cb67fd","5e7094c5878c28a0473c35de","679b57ecfdbe8318b4cb67fe","679b57ecfdbe8318b4cb67ff","679b57ecfdbe8318b4cb6800","679b57ecfdbe8318b4cb6801"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477033","mniswId":"1144","title":"Animal Genetics","issn":"0268-9146","documentHash":"dcabd5c0-0052-4d77-91ed-6af8955572b1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679b57ecfdbe8318b4cb67f8","year":"2024","volume":"55","number":"6","documentHash":"53f75305-6017-4956-8cdb-9bf13b7e8df1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060579637"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b662efdbe8318b4cc8bb6","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Vacuška","documentHash":"e300f74d-a6ec-411f-80fe-8c68ab7c601a"},{"objectId":"679b662efdbe8318b4cc8bb5","name":"Zdeňka","lastName":"Vacušková","documentHash":"8f0d6db8-5bf6-4929-afb3-f62050c82907"},{"objectId":"5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","name":"Irene","lastName":"Camerlink","uuid":"63511C46590F3B7E26AA60526C552EED8D9F0549F8DEE5333E681582883DA44BB38FF69E2CB85D2955FD7C17DC6CFA4F35E7BE97ABD84CE52B2422233F186398","documentHash":"21f3e447-93d1-4634-92b3-8aae9343fdc4"}],"objectId":"679b662efdbe8318b4cc8bb3","doi":"10.1016/j.livsci.2024.105623","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1871141324002294?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Infrared thermography of different tear staining scores in pigs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tear staining is increasingly suggested as a potential indicator for pig welfare. However, current research outcomes on tear staining are inconclusive. There is therefore a need for more information on this potential indicator. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between tear staining scores and infrared thermography (IRT) of the inner canthus of the eye (with eye temperature relating to emotional states). We expected that pigs with a more severe tear staining score would have a higher eye IRT value. Pigs of a high-welfare research herd were assessed for tear staining using a 6-point scoring scale. Twenty-four female pigs with tear staining scores from 0 to 3 were selected, while scores 4 and 5 did not occur. Pigs were subjected to IRT of the right eye, in a test area specially constructed for IRT. Data were analysed in a generalised linear mixed model with IRT value as response variable and tear staining score, age and temperature-humidity index as predictor variables. The results showed no significant relationship between tear staining score and IRT values. The average IRT value was 37.1 ± 0.34, with the highest IRT values in tear staining score 3. The pigs’ age did not influence the outcomes. In this small-scale study we did not find a relationship between tear staining and eye IRT. Nevertheless, the outcomes show that tear staining is prevalent also in high welfare systems and we therefore urge for caution in using tear staining as a welfare indicator."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"291","pagesFromTo":"105623","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679b662efdbe8318b4cc8bb5","679b662efdbe8318b4cc8bb6","5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d0f","mniswId":"13726","title":"Livestock Science","issn":"1871-1413","eissn":"1878-0490","documentHash":"02fff2c1-dbd2-4330-9520-3cd219e7025b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679b662efdbe8318b4cc8bb4","year":"2025","volume":"291","documentHash":"788c5987-f9ba-48c0-baf8-66f4ce37c804"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Tear staining; Thermal imaging; Sus scrofa; Animal welfare indicator; Eye temperature; Chromodacryorrhoea"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060579766"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633e3da97523402e340f9cea","name":"Li","lastName":"Chen","uuid":"DA6D944797DD85D567FAAF68136D03D1DA2A57DAE89A267ADAA626C6C5FB657C54C0AD48252F51747B871248C3569F1B2C22B9B98BDFF5FEBB29FE0918CA4FAC","documentHash":"c888f9d4-f822-4958-8928-be3e448bbecf"},{"objectId":"5e7094c5878c28a0473c35de","name":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Taniguchi","uuid":"2A0CFA9A6B89CB3CEE777F6F29214022AA2419D8BBE1FF66B80CE36A84BCB2DAE93CEBE3F7258D0DD97DB84D6A83C7505E1F7080FBD9BCC6908DB71E44B02055","orcidId":"0000-0001-7270-390X","documentHash":"5b3a159e-86a4-4b30-accc-523bf3563bab"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a04739966f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Bagnicka","uuid":"0D37A8BCF2F4D93F59FC1D87DBDADCE868EF14AFD99EBF96C877CC86963C73AE2E470CED6B83A3F731B3B08724BDCE11D9A8CE8A0CE7E36513995F6A5C4D000D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7193-2006","documentHash":"a42098e0-b6d5-4d75-b67b-2d9b112c9c92"}],"objectId":"679b7754fdbe8318b4ce63ea","doi":"10.3390/foods13040619","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/4/619/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Microproteomic-Based Analysis of the Goat Milk Protein Synthesis Network and Casein Production Evaluation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Goat milk has been consumed by humans since ancient times and is highly nutritious. Its quality is mainly determined by its casein content. Milk protein synthesis is controlled by a complex network with many signal pathways. Therefore, the aim of our study is to clearly depict the signal pathways involved in milk protein synthesis in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) using state-of-the-art microproteomic techniques and to identify the key genes involved in the signal pathway. The microproteomic analysis identified more than 2253 proteins, with 323 pathways annotated from the identified proteins. Knockdown of IRS1 expression significantly influenced goat casein composition (α, β, and κ); therefore, this study also examined the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) gene more closely. A total of 12 differential expression proteins (DEPs) were characterized as upregulated or downregulated in the IRS1-silenced sample compared to the negative control. The enrichment and signal pathways of these DEPs in GMECs were identified using GO annotation and KEGG, as well as KOG analysis. Our findings expand our understanding of the functional genes involved in milk protein synthesis in goats, paving the way for new approaches for modifying casein content for the dairy goat industry and milk product development."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c5878c28a0473c35de","633e3da97523402e340f9cea","5e70929f878c28a04739966f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"619","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094c5878c28a0473c35de","5e70929f878c28a04739966f","633e3da97523402e340f9cea"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","issn":"2304-8158","eissn":"2304-8158","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"827d8888-1217-4c9f-a068-b8a2e5756417"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d1b568409707172eaee67c","year":"2024","volume":"13","number":"4","documentHash":"c9cfc54a-c2df-457d-9997-ed75adccc401"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["goat milk protein synthesis network; microproteomic analysis; IRS1 gene; milk protein content evaluation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060579811"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b3110fdbe8318b4c90ae4","name":"Veronique","lastName":"Blanquet","documentHash":"270eb0d6-3aa6-4348-bd76-7bdfda55f158"},{"objectId":"679b3110fdbe8318b4c90ae3","name":"Christa","lastName":"Kühn","documentHash":"04bb90b3-61f7-410d-94a0-309f9a8bc774"},{"objectId":"679b3110fdbe8318b4c90ae2","name":"Caroline","lastName":"Mörke","documentHash":"bd1edd42-1d06-4637-ac31-1b9d3fa9589b"},{"objectId":"679b3110fdbe8318b4c90ae1","name":"Dominique","lastName":"Rocha","documentHash":"effeca49-8b76-445e-b25e-4ad3ff2da1fd"},{"objectId":"5e7094c5878c28a0473c35de","name":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Taniguchi","uuid":"2A0CFA9A6B89CB3CEE777F6F29214022AA2419D8BBE1FF66B80CE36A84BCB2DAE93CEBE3F7258D0DD97DB84D6A83C7505E1F7080FBD9BCC6908DB71E44B02055","orcidId":"0000-0001-7270-390X","documentHash":"5b3a159e-86a4-4b30-accc-523bf3563bab"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473aca04","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Stojak","uuid":"E5FCE57AE8D2CB372EC45E4E6EEA6CC7930B0DD54638B2428C235CFE64827AD6839227FB3C40053387C8E8F8C4BC7A92A082BBDC2BD2D38A68B2AB3C4B5846E3","orcidId":"0000-0003-2423-5026","documentHash":"7ff78e06-c1e4-4729-ac0c-c7988088c6a2"}],"objectId":"679b3110fdbe8318b4c90adf","doi":"10.1007/s13353-024-00846-3","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13353-024-00846-3.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Establishment of a cloning-free CRISPR/Cas9 protocol to generate large deletions in the bovine MDBK cell line","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The CRISPR/Cas9 technique applied to modify the cattle genome has value in increasing animal health and welfare.

After screening for duplicates, VOS Viewer and CiteSpace were used to analyze and visualize the data.\n\nResults: Scientific interest in FCC has grown and resulted in the scientific output of 4,836 publications originating from 103 different countries. Based on the frequent author keywords, FCC was of greatest interest in neonatology and pediatrics, nursing, critical and intensive care, end-of-life and palliative care, and patient-related outcomes. The recent research hotspots are “patient engagement,” “qualitative study,” and “health literacy.”\n\nConclusion: FCC has gained recognition and spread from the pediatric to the adult palliative, intensive, end-of-life and geriatric care settings. This is a very reassuring development since adults, especially when older, want and need the assistance of their social support systems. Recent research directions include the involvement of patients in the development of FCC strategies, health literacy interventions and the uptake of telemedicine solutions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679c886dfdbe830b35f6aa7e","679c886dfdbe830b35f6aa7f","679c886dfdbe830b35f6aa80","679c886dfdbe830b35f6aa81","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","679c886dfdbe830b35f6aa82"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1b2","mniswId":"6847","title":"Frontiers in Medicine","issn":"2296-858X","eissn":"2296-858X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"6c827de0-68f7-433c-bd4c-6f332f60833e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6617c206409707791fcfde13","year":"2024","volume":"11","documentHash":"fa2d824a-eca3-4a0e-afa6-b92740de3144"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["neonatal care, pediatrics, adult medicine, intensive care, palliative care, end-of-life care, family involvement, digitalisation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060582871"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679c9906fdbe830b35f87102","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Mandryk","documentHash":"e4ed4290-dde3-49d6-8f36-7e9625fd4b1a"},{"objectId":"5f98f237085dcb424e4c1b9c","name":"Iga","lastName":"Bartel","uuid":"D5E820C41151FCECD975218E81CA96BD0D84CB152279F8AA34A5FC4A49C1C387FDFADF9011C81D5D4D781E6B6206964D5B8A9691D8D87422BF97BB0F2A1922C0","orcidId":"0000-0002-8363-2016","documentHash":"2fc8f736-4081-4b2f-9619-a69a08083629"},{"objectId":"5f87bf6c085dcb410a25ef74","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Koszarska","uuid":"B1975463EE86FD1B5D99ABB4BAB6B8A70CEC8A7D217DF620B7B2CF77DD18E12EF7A3AF669CA73759CDC0BCBE4558E032168BB17D7416A7E931AEA5414962C804","orcidId":"0000-0002-0442-6127","documentHash":"6866275f-f278-4c4e-a3ba-ac16bd684582"}],"objectId":"679c9906fdbe830b35f87101","doi":"10.2478/aspr-2023-0043","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/aspr-2023-0043","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Syringic acid as a pivotal component in reducing oxidative stress parameters in the civilization diseases - a review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Oxidative stress is defined as a biological balance between the amount of reactive oxygen species, especially free oxygen radicals, and the action of antioxidant systems, including the so-called repair mechanisms.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the field of oncology, emerging as a powerful treatment strategy. A key pathway that has garnered considerable attention is programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1). The interaction between PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and PD-1 reduces the innate immune response and thus compromises the capability of the body’s immune system. Furthermore, it controls the phenotype and functionality of innate and adaptive immune components. A range of monoclonal antibodies, including avelumab, atezolizumab, camrelizumab, dostarlimab, durvalumab, sinitilimab, toripalimab, and zimberelimab, have been developed for targeting the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1. These agents can induce a broad spectrum of autoimmune-like complications that may affect any organ system. Recent studies have focused on the effect of various natural compounds that inhibit immune checkpoints. This could contribute to the existing arsenal of anticancer drugs. Several bioactive natural agents have been shown to affect the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis, promoting tumor cell apoptosis, influencing cell proliferation, and eventually leading to tumor cell death and inhibiting cancer progression. However, there is a substantial knowledge gap regarding the role of different natural compounds targeting PD-1 in the context of cancer. Hence, this review aims to provide a common connection between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and the anticancer effects of distinct natural molecules. Moreover, the primary focus will be on the underlying mechanism of action as well as the clinical efficacy of bioactive molecules.

Here, we investigated the effects of advanced maternal age on offspring health and behavior in two genetically divergent mouse strains: the BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mouse model of idiopathic autism, and the C57BL/6 J (B6) control strain, as a model of genetic variability. In both strains, advanced maternal age negatively affected female reproductive and pregnancy outcomes, and perturbed placental and fetal growth, and the expression of genes in the fetal brain tissues. Postnatally, advanced maternal age had strain-dependent effects on offspring sociability, learning skills, and the occurrence of perseverative behaviors, varying between male and female offspring. These findings disentangle the relationship between genetic determinants and maternal age-related factors in shaping the emergence of autism-like behaviors in mice, highlighting the interplay between maternal age, genetic variability, and prenatal programming, in the occurrence of neurodevelopmental disorders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63881fb975234052dad46665","63881fb975234052dad4666e","5e709499878c28a0473c02b2","5e709499878c28a0473c02a5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63881fb975234052dad4666e","63881fb975234052dad46665","5e709499878c28a0473c02b2","5e709499878c28a0473c02a5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6597d34e40970755be5e2b9e","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"1","documentHash":"7b2bf3c4-186e-4bd9-8908-044ad024e285"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Advanced maternal age; Pregnancy; Behavior; Autism; BTBR mice"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060583164"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67a1b6b2fdbe83433d281c46","name":"Emil D.","lastName":"Parvanov","documentHash":"70f096d4-7cc9-4213-a567-abf67f378552"},{"objectId":"67a1b6b2fdbe83433d281c45","name":"Jivko","lastName":"Stoyanov","documentHash":"e07aaf7f-fbb0-4927-8660-20f0c5bf78cb"},{"objectId":"67a1b6b2fdbe83433d281c44","name":"Farhan Bin","lastName":"Matin","documentHash":"9ab70ee4-bfeb-42b0-83d1-9441ef9e5413"},{"objectId":"67a1b6b2fdbe83433d281c43","name":"Marc A.","lastName":"Smith","documentHash":"8694dd03-caf3-4614-a339-ef2af695e60f"},{"objectId":"67a1b6b2fdbe83433d281c42","name":"Dalibor","lastName":"Hrg","documentHash":"15418485-1fce-49ec-9f45-f1eb62edba9c"},{"objectId":"67a1b6b2fdbe83433d281c41","name":"Himel","lastName":"Mondal","documentHash":"201bae66-e028-45ca-8248-917b022c3d08"},{"objectId":"671610cdece39836623b1eff","name":"Maima","lastName":"Matin","uuid":"028B8E8EDCF7D67A78E16C226F937DAAC626533E030CC2CD79DF049C5F6AC008ED2C671E37A5912CDF0CC34E742667D43D8854F7413AC6FB857EBF57B01E355C","documentHash":"52857f92-cb97-439c-860d-0d296c5467a7"},{"objectId":"612d94299543c7051ff01b28","name":"Michel ","lastName":"Mickael","uuid":"6C0F190719C006F28401303260F31EB975571B3A00976F324446353810A0BEBD070D7D62CAB7367E88BFD3385375A74E21C88497F33459BA7C60F5AA5C3267FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-4186-4900","documentHash":"93399ad0-db2d-4c58-b04e-476d4131aaa8"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"67a1b6b2fdbe83433d281c40","doi":"10.37349/edht.2024.00016","publicUri":"https://www.explorationpub.com/Journals/edht/Article/101116","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The power of #physiotherapy: a social media hashtag investigation on X (formerly Twitter)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Aim: The social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, has emerged as a significant hub for healthcare-related conversations and sharing information.

This study explores the impact of dietary inclusion of chokeberry pomace on oxidative stress parameters and other milk quality parameters in high-producing dairy goats. Material and Methods: Twenty-seven goats were allocated into three groups: a control group provided standard feed and two experimental groups provided feed supplemented with 15 g or 30 g of chokeberry pomace per kilogram. Milk samples were analysed for physicochemical traits, a range of enzyme activities and antioxidant properties. Results: Supplementation with chokeberry pomace significantly reduced milk fat content, enhanced antioxidative properties and increased most of the quantified enzyme activities. Total polyphenol content and reduced glutathione levels were significantly higher in the supplemented groups, correlating with improved antioxidative potential of the milk. Conclusion: Chokeberry pomace in goat diets enhances milk’s antioxidative properties and upregulates its enzymatic activity profile, suggesting a potential strategy to improve the nutritional quality and health benefits of goat milk. The study underscores the utility of chokeberry pomace as a feed additive that might not only benefit animal health but also contribute to enhanced milk quality."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d56","5e7092a1878c28a047399828","5e7092ae878c28a04739a77f","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","5e70923d878c28a04739228b","671610cdece39836623b1eff","5e709489878c28a0473bf258"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61d510b87523401fc110f98b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"409-417","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d56","671610cdece39836623b1eff","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","5e7092ae878c28a04739a77f","61d510b87523401fc110f98b","5e709489878c28a0473bf258","5e70923d878c28a04739228b","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e7092a1878c28a047399828"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dairy goats, chokeberry pomace, feed additives, oxidative stress, milk quality"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060592932"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679a2bb7fdbe831aedccf081","name":"S.

It is known that naloxone—an opioid antagonist—may exert a hypertensive effect. Recent experimental and clinical evidence supports the important role of inflammatory mechanisms in hypertension. Since opioids may play a role in the regulation of both blood pressure and immune response, we studied these two processes in our model. We aimed to evaluate the effect of selective and non-selective opioid receptor antagonists on blood pressure and T-cell activation in a mouse model of high swim stress-induced analgesia. Blood pressure was measured before and during the infusion of opioid receptor antagonists using a non-invasive tail–cuff measurement system. To assess the activation of T-cells, flow cytometry was used. We discovered that the non-selective antagonism of the opioid system by naloxone caused a significant elevation of blood pressure. The selective antagonism of μ and κ but not δ opioid receptors significantly increased systolic blood pressure. Subsequently, a brief characterization of T-cell subsets was performed. We found that the blockade of μ and δ receptors is associated with the increased expression of CD69 on CD4 T-cells. Moreover, we observed an increase in the central memory CD4 and central memory CD8 T-cell populations after the δ opioid receptor blockade. The antagonism of the μ opioid receptor increased the CD8 effector and central memory T-cell populations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70930c878c28a0473a1ca1","5e709422878c28a0473b6d30","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e70927a878c28a047396795","5e709347878c28a0473a660e","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","60c31aa19543c72336543d50"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"2618","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70930c878c28a0473a1ca1","60c31aa19543c72336543d50","5e70927a878c28a047396795","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","67a1c0d4fdbe83433d28efc2","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","67a1c0d4fdbe83433d28efc3","67a1c0d4fdbe83433d28efc4","5e709347878c28a0473a660e","5e709422878c28a0473b6d30"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65dd85d540970770918f3e35","year":"2024","volume":"25","number":"5","doi":"","documentHash":"4d1fc33d-7c96-4de6-887f-1c0a8e4c106d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["blood pressure; opioids; naloxone; T-cell"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060685963"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b6117fdbe8318b4cc384a","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Wysokińska","documentHash":"236a5833-0e9e-40e6-887e-dfe06ebae931"},{"objectId":"679b6117fdbe8318b4cc3849","name":"Laretta","lastName":"Grabowska-Derlatka","documentHash":"55faf98d-058a-41a0-8d10-016159e864ba"},{"objectId":"679b6117fdbe8318b4cc3848","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Gryziak","documentHash":"db7539ec-f284-44f9-925c-683358928a25"},{"objectId":"679b6117fdbe8318b4cc3847","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Chmiel","documentHash":"8f53bb14-e8c5-49aa-8c0c-e3e644bbb95c"},{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b7584","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Kraj","uuid":"6B4FAB5B4E469EAC77112DE2CEE3684F19D09BEEAFF12D6B9CB8103391BE63C52E7FB31D181872B9A10946110649EBD5AC6C690BB0CBFC8DA25C6F4F31E623D7","documentHash":"1ddd2dfd-60da-4a20-88fc-557803050450"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"92D7C04F8AB3A7BAFDD427A486DDA8E51BB9EF910CE1748A4A41C1B5DD9D2FBC73939751C42B68AF9AB4431CFBC5570C935A57B7BE63B7045AA234AF1888672B","documentHash":"da59b83b-fda3-4817-8136-ba0e1298aa2f"}],"objectId":"679b6117fdbe8318b4cc3846","doi":"10.3390/cancers16071293","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/16/7/1293/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Impact of Thrombocytopenia on Survival in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Updated Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Platelets (PLT) have a role in the pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and could represent a readily measurable laboratory parameter to enhance the comprehensive evaluation of HCC patients. Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched with a focus on survival as well as patient and tumor-specific characteristics in correlation to reported PLT counts. Survival outcomes were analyzed with both common-effect and random-effects models. The hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) from analyzed trials were incorporated. Studies that did not provide survival data but focused on platelet count correlation with HCC characteristics were reviewed. Results: In total, 26 studies, including a total of 9403 patients, met our criteria. The results showed that thrombocytopenia in HCC patients was associated with poor overall survival (common-effect HR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06–1.25; random-effect HR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.05–1.63). Moreover, three studies reveal significant correlations between PLT indices and tumor characteristics such as size, foci number, and etiology of HCC development. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis confirmed that PLT count could act as a prognostic marker in HCC, especially with a PLT count cut off <100 × 103/mm3. Further prospective studies focusing on the role of PLT in clearly defined subgroups are necessary."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709428878c28a0473b7584","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1293","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709428878c28a0473b7584","679b6117fdbe8318b4cc3847","679b6117fdbe8318b4cc3848","679b6117fdbe8318b4cc3849","679b6117fdbe8318b4cc384a","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bc61","mniswId":"3233","title":"Cancers","issn":"2072-6694","eissn":"2072-6694","documentHash":"f0e50d29-981c-4673-8ae3-36a723786ffe"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66a37779fdbe836c5d8a9a56","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"7","documentHash":"5b3b25ad-f9da-44bc-96ea-e96d60b50dc2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hepatocellular carcinoma; HCC; thrombocytopenia; platelets; outcome; tumor features"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060686153"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679c9e70fdbe830b35f8f4f5","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Religa","documentHash":"c2e76240-8464-4fff-964f-9bfec3eaa964"},{"objectId":"679c9e70fdbe830b35f8f4f4","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kamińska","documentHash":"bd7b5bf6-f687-4818-9fee-337af483b39f"},{"objectId":"679c9e70fdbe830b35f8f4f3","name":"Norwin","lastName":"Kubick","documentHash":"b5a4ce6c-ca10-4dc4-8abf-43a642f89928"},{"objectId":"612d94299543c7051ff01b28","name":"Michel ","lastName":"Mickael","uuid":"6C0F190719C006F28401303260F31EB975571B3A00976F324446353810A0BEBD070D7D62CAB7367E88BFD3385375A74E21C88497F33459BA7C60F5AA5C3267FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-4186-4900","documentHash":"93399ad0-db2d-4c58-b04e-476d4131aaa8"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"},{"objectId":"5e70933b878c28a0473a5603","name":"Michał","lastName":"Ławiński","uuid":"2DED7D2DB991F9E70EC3CFD116C9753DB94901B541E4EDCC0D64539D0AB2B3067286B6D90BEABC890CEA3F1E25F3FBDDEC7A8E9A52A4332DC40E4C250FAC0B74","orcidId":"0000-0001-6129-7723","documentHash":"1d1c31eb-3c16-4d10-8776-07c1232920ad"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Sacharczuk","uuid":"8E2CFC97D0176907FD3FDCC1CB83621D26B1BE05F486A6134D990E8B18DF3BF8E8F3AADDCDC1D73F10233B59A74445730E291963FD429C8698BFDF373BA38AEF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6309-5292","documentHash":"fc3da1d3-82af-4442-a191-158025188e29"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399193","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Horbańczuk","uuid":"976205AE9A3DD4FA85531EB44854AE0083FBAD6743C6797D800A9669BD6FAED38693031A6C16E0A03AAE6903DEB2CEF4B47FFF137CB5399DCB5BFBCFCFF25343","orcidId":"0000-0002-7561-0941","documentHash":"a9235661-fb2e-4102-b6a6-35060d6414c3"}],"objectId":"679c9e70fdbe830b35f8f4f2","doi":"10.3390/cimb46080465","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/46/8/465/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The Current Landscape of Hypotheses Describing the Contribution of CD4+ Heterogeneous Populations to ALS","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a poorly understood and fatal disease. It has a low prevalence and a 2–4 year survival period. Various theories and hypotheses relating to its development process have been proposed, albeit with no breakthrough in its treatment. Recently, the role of the adaptive immune system in ALS, particularly CD4+ T cells, has begun to be investigated. CD4+ T cells are a heterogeneous group of immune cells. They include highly pro-inflammatory types such as Th1 and Th17, as well as highly anti-inflammatory cells such as Tregs. However, the landscape of the role of CD4+ T cells in ALS is still not clearly understood. This review covers current hypotheses that elucidate how various CD4+ T cells can contribute to ALS development. These hypotheses include the SWITCH model, which suggests that, in the early stages of the disease, Tregs are highly capable of regulating the immune response. However, in the later stages of the disease, it seems that pro-inflammatory cells such as Th1 and Th17 are capable of overwhelming Treg function. The reason why this occurs is not known. Several research groups have proposed that CD4+ T cells as a whole might experience aging. Others have proposed that gamma delta T cells might directly target Tregs. Additionally, other research groups have argued that less well-known CD4+ T cells, such as Emoes+ CD4+ T cells, may be directly responsible for neuron death by producing granzyme B. We propose that the ALS landscape is highly complicated and that there is more than one feasible hypothesis. However, it is critical to take into consideration the differences in the ability of different populations of CD4+ T cells to infiltrate the blood–brain barrier, taking into account the brain region and the time of infiltration. Shedding more light on these still obscure factors can help to create a personalized therapy capable of regaining the balance of power in the battle between the anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cells in the central nervous system of ALS patients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5e70933b878c28a0473a5603","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e70929c878c28a047399193"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"46","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"7846-7861","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","612d94299543c7051ff01b28","679c9e70fdbe830b35f8f4f3","679c9e70fdbe830b35f8f4f4","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","679c9e70fdbe830b35f8f4f5","5e70933b878c28a0473a5603"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477880","mniswId":"4712","title":"CURRENT ISSUES IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY","issn":"1467-3037","eissn":"1467-3045","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"6394e31b-1e49-445c-8b5f-a633b88d8b18"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66dee3f9fdbe832ef89e16a1","year":"2024","volume":"46","number":"8","documentHash":"aaae60a0-bfbe-4f19-a3a2-58bc84fcf367"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CD4; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Th17; Treg"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060686540"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b00b6e40970719778948dd","name":"E.","lastName":"Kawecka-Grochocka","documentHash":"49e943b1-1065-4ad5-b7ef-93558b34f853"},{"objectId":"65b00b6e40970719778948dc","name":"K.","lastName":"Rutkowska","documentHash":"a2df62af-813e-4384-8060-7990a49ebc3d"},{"objectId":"65b00b6e40970719778948d9","name":"D.

These genes included diacylglycerol-o-acyltransferase (DGAT1), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase alpha (ACACA) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor (SREBF1). The use of extracts had no apparent effect on the quality of buck meat. The bucks supplemented with an extract mixture were heavier after 124 days of rearing than controls, primarily due to greater daily weight gain. They had higher cold carcass weights and improved slaughter performance. No differences in the expression of lipid metabolism genes were recorded, indicating that supplementation did not negatively affect metabolic processes.\r\nDuring meat maturation, both groups exhibited similar changes in lightness and pH. However, the colorimetric analysis revealed lower a* and b* values, indicating paler meat – desirable for consumers.

However, the influence of geopolitics on bioethical considerations, particularly regarding bioweapons research, remains an underexplored area. This study delves into the uncharted territory of how international political interests can intersect with bioethical principles, potentially shaping collaborative efforts and global health policies related to bioweapons research. Through a hypothetical scenario involving a hypothetical pathogen, a collaborative effort between unspecified countries, we examine the implications of such cooperation on global health governance, with a specific focus on bioweapons research. Ethical dilemmas surrounding responsible research, potential risks and benefits, equitable distribution of findings, and biosafety measures are explored. This analysis underscores the importance of transparent and responsible practices in bioweapons research amidst geopolitical tensions.

Depression is treatable through psychotherapy, antidepressant medications, lifestyle changes, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for severe cases. Research on depression aims to understand its mechanisms, develop effective treatments, and explore neurobiological approaches, genetic markers, and substances like ketamine and psychedelics for treatment-resistant depression. Research on neuroinflammation in depression suggests it may contribute to depression. Recent studies reveal peripheral immune cells infiltrate the brain, causing symptoms like astrogliosis and demyelination. CD4+ T cells, originating from bone marrow precursors, mature in the thymus, recognizing foreign antigens and assisting other immune cells. They differentiate into various subsets for coordinated immune responses. The TH1/TH2 axis regulates the immune system, involving the differentiation and balance of TH1 and TH2 subsets. TH1 cells promote cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens, while TH2 cells promote humoral immunity. Maintaining balance is crucial for immune homeostasis, as imbalances can lead to diseases and allergies. TH17 and Treg cells, both part of the CD4+ T cell family, have distinct functions. TH17 cells can cause pathogenic effects, while Treg cells regulate their functions. The TH17/Treg axis is highly reprogrammable, with Treg cells transforming into TH17-like cells. In depression, immune cells cross the BBB, a crucial brain defense mechanism, through diapedesis, aiming to migrate to the disease's location. They challenge the neurovascular unit, endothelial cells, basal membrane, pericytes, and astrocytes, ensuring optimal brain function and minimizing toxins exposure. This chapter covers in detail the interaction between various CD4+ T cells and the BBB."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e70929c878c28a047399193"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"179-199","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","67a1c5b2fdbe83433d291ce2"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"677f9a2cfdbe831a91d09964","title":"PsychoNeuroImmunology  Volume 2: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Diseases","year":2024,"isbn":"978-3-031-72078-9","url":"https://link.springer.com/book/9783031720789","translation":false,"documentHash":"fa5057fb-f216-4975-bb11-aab2a1d7d449","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060699914"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67a1be52fdbe83433d28d929","name":"Daria M.","lastName":"Urbańska","documentHash":"e32f17cf-fb60-4e5a-9088-8ca212a379c8"},{"objectId":"67a1be52fdbe83433d28d928","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Kawecka-Grochocka","documentHash":"526e453e-3f4d-4e61-99c4-4fbed8133019"},{"objectId":"67a1be52fdbe83433d28d927","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Rzewuska","documentHash":"d4e092cf-80dd-4a3f-8ee7-08595c9108b8"},{"objectId":"67a1be52fdbe83433d28d926","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Brzozowska","documentHash":"815f37be-1aed-459b-bbbf-5fea7baa9463"},{"objectId":"67a1be52fdbe83433d28d925","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zalewska","documentHash":"219e7fd9-8982-4969-8155-4b672cb51d9e"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Sakowski","uuid":"C87300CD8C2E2C660E7BA7643D2648CA6260BCA2F36C89DE3CE9CA734753DCBC23AA717DC64FD468245A05CBE16B5C43FBA0570AE5ECA8CFC6CBF48252E899D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-2264-4638","documentHash":"cfaaf5aa-3854-4022-a3c5-b8e2e8624a3e"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a04739966f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Bagnicka","uuid":"0D37A8BCF2F4D93F59FC1D87DBDADCE868EF14AFD99EBF96C877CC86963C73AE2E470CED6B83A3F731B3B08724BDCE11D9A8CE8A0CE7E36513995F6A5C4D000D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7193-2006","documentHash":"a42098e0-b6d5-4d75-b67b-2d9b112c9c92"}],"objectId":"67a1be52fdbe83433d28d923","doi":"10.3168/jds.2024-25346","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0022030224012852?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"The quality and technological parameters of milk obtained from dairy cows with subclinical mastitis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mastitis is one of the most common diseases in dairy cattle. It significantly reduces milk quality and yield, thus incurring economic losses for farmers. This study investigates the impact of various bacterial pathogens on the SCC, milk composition, and technological properties of milk samples from 302 clinically healthy Polish Holstein-Friesian cows kept under intensive rearing conditions. Of the 462 milk samples analyzed, 85.06% were contaminated with bacteria. The majority were coagulase-negative staphylococci (52.60%). Escherichia coli, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis, (Group 4) and Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae (Group 5), collectively considered major pathogens, were identified in 16.66% of samples; their presence was associated with higher SCC levels. Additionally, contamination with Staph. aureus or Strep. agalactiae had prolonged clotting time, adversely affected curd and whey quality, with curd yield remaining unaltered. Bacterial contamination did not appear to significantly affect the yield of milk or its main components, namely protein, casein, lactose, fat, TS, solid nonfat, free fatty acid, or citric acid. Although pH, freezing point depression (FPD), and acidity also remained unaffected by bacterial contamination, they were significantly influenced by herd-year-season of calving and herd-year-time of sampling interaction effects. The results indicate that the presence of bacteria causing subclinical mastitis negatively influences milk processing potential. However, fixed linear regression indicated that the number of colony-forming units (cfu/mL) only had a significant influence on FPD and clotting time, and as such, the number of bacteria in a sample did not influence milk yield or quality during subclinical chronic mastitis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0","5e70929f878c28a04739966f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"108","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"1285-1300","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67a1be52fdbe83433d28d925","67a1be52fdbe83433d28d926","67a1be52fdbe83433d28d927","67a1be52fdbe83433d28d928","67a1be52fdbe83433d28d929","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0","5e70929f878c28a04739966f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454785fb","mniswId":"10746","title":"Journal of Dairy Science","issn":"0022-0302","documentHash":"062f3503-70e9-4118-b6c2-97a163e1911a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67a1be52fdbe83433d28d924","year":"2025","volume":"108","number":"2","documentHash":"6c58026b-72d1-444c-92c5-fcd0910fe8bb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dairy cattle; mammary gland inflammation; milk quality; milk technological parameters"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060725651"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6752eedafdbe83525b94074a","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Meglicki","documentHash":"979d3b0f-4a41-4003-bda7-331104c7bf54"},{"objectId":"5e70947a878c28a0473be025","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Filimonow","uuid":"797A13EE2781024BCBEEEF07649C734E4A07472C1D4C79E8F7F018497742D80F389D01499BF34A157684027CEA0FB30E7FC03E2B493EF8F2A35CD22C2F803FFE","orcidId":"0000-0002-3924-6011","documentHash":"de6273a3-066b-44e4-abe7-ab152c641076"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7d57","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Suwińska","uuid":"A0018D16A74DDDEAE4B5CB93E99ACF607CCFFDEA76CA769F0D6D18E3427C2F0817BB16445E701A0AEC76BE2F62AD9CF55B5317445B69D0A504A9580F0E613F16","orcidId":"0000-0001-8366-2197","documentHash":"56fc7f3c-11d5-42b2-a708-b5a72001cc04"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a78c4","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Szczepańska","uuid":"2FED6C26863956ECAE43D78955F4BDD0ABF79AD91896A7A1F8B09682A214368D712C6698260B77B8E7E1BEB8A1A096AE2019C20875E965C23A8A727E85409241","orcidId":"0000-0002-8805-725X","documentHash":"c1c638cf-8c03-4974-90fd-76104972e7a4"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a7849","name":"Marek","lastName":"Maleszewski","uuid":"1C75FA4B79BD69B4206B0E88C2F37642DF2BD3AE6A9E56FDEC26ABCE7677F95E076659D6ECC237B9E6DB6EAA7BAC149729C67A090B4A1CD0BFD852B06CBDB23C","orcidId":"0000-0002-6699-0452","documentHash":"ff64d348-e391-4fe0-9af1-97951ac3263e"},{"objectId":"5e7092e3878c28a04739ecb5","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Wolińska-Nizioł","uuid":"586086546BF1F584F920923A110A748CA8B5CA71D275F5E0F18A1B46B9DD43484E8B64028BB06D9F3E52EEA50EDBD634CE2A2D4EB97FC5EB092A53A65EAB5FD1","orcidId":"0000-0002-5540-9845","documentHash":"ac7970ef-8791-490a-87d7-e8e3ada70b1b"}],"objectId":"6752eedafdbe83525b940748","doi":"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2024.11.022","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0093691X24004849?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Downregulation of Pecam-1 is insufficient to redefine embryonic stem cells' fate toward PrE in chimaeric mouse blastocysts","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this work, we aimed to investigate whether Pecam-1 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1) surface protein of ICM cells is involved in primitive endoderm (PrE) differentiation. For this purpose, we used embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as an in vitro model for ICM cells, and induced differentiation of ESCs into PrE cells by retinoic acid (RA). Using immunostaining, we observed that at the protein level Pecam-1 diminishes in the early stages of ESC differentiation towards PrE. It is known that in early blastocysts Pecam-1 is detected in all ICM cells, but after the segregation of the epiblast (EPI) and PrE layers, its presence is restricted to EPI cells. Moreover, it was previously reported that a population of ESCs with reduced SSEA-1 and Pecam-1 levels differentiates into PrE. Thus, we examined whether the absence of Pecam-1 in ESCs is sufficient to induce differentiation of these cells into the PrE. To this end, ESCs in which Pecam-1 expression had been downregulated by siRNA were microinjected into 8-cell and blastocyst stage embryos. We found that not only the modified ESCs failed to differentiate into PrE, but similarly to the unmodified control cells, integrated within the EPI. This indicates that the decrease in Pecam-1 expression is not sufficient to promote the differentiation of ESCs into PrE in chimaeric embryos."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709355878c28a0473a7849","5e7092e3878c28a04739ecb5","6752eedafdbe83525b94074a","5e70947a878c28a0473be025","5e709359878c28a0473a7d57","5e709356878c28a0473a78c4"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947a878c28a0473be025"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"234","pagesFromTo":"1-8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947a878c28a0473be025","5e709356878c28a0473a78c4","6752eedafdbe83525b94074a","5e7092e3878c28a04739ecb5","5e709359878c28a0473a7d57","5e709355878c28a0473a7849"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479934","mniswId":"19490","title":"Theriogenology","issn":"0093-691X","eissn":"0093-691X","documentHash":"5f4ba9bb-877b-4f92-a4fd-38461a3a9174"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6752eedafdbe83525b940749","year":"2025","volume":"234","documentHash":"499bb650-afd1-4aac-8e98-749ee27dc942"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060732386"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663c75ff4097071b7581c3b8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ukleja","documentHash":"2fc19da0-0c95-49f3-8e0a-4d706b4a65c2"},{"objectId":"663c75ff4097071b7581c3b7","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Jachnis","documentHash":"d6ebf3d8-d09e-48dc-84dc-46903285d4fb"},{"objectId":"663c75ff4097071b7581c3b6","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Zadka","documentHash":"69707835-82b5-4b96-b200-b4f9e19000c9"},{"objectId":"663c75ff4097071b7581c3b5","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Jałocha","documentHash":"01507340-1eff-4c17-b0da-d4324faeb864"},{"objectId":"645c532940e3ff38f8b52cde","name":"Maima","lastName":"Matin","uuid":"F966FEE4F4BBEE1AF2E791E459CD5BDA7C44A89E20C057D9A45FE5A463FC879BA433A3E11345816D542D1B5EE8D2BDA645312E6DCE7D649961E78DB9434746F4","documentHash":"d0d97aa6-50cb-4181-acee-cacee69ceda9"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"},{"objectId":"5e70933b878c28a0473a5603","name":"Michał","lastName":"Ławiński","uuid":"2DED7D2DB991F9E70EC3CFD116C9753DB94901B541E4EDCC0D64539D0AB2B3067286B6D90BEABC890CEA3F1E25F3FBDDEC7A8E9A52A4332DC40E4C250FAC0B74","orcidId":"0000-0001-6129-7723","documentHash":"1d1c31eb-3c16-4d10-8776-07c1232920ad"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399193","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Horbańczuk","uuid":"976205AE9A3DD4FA85531EB44854AE0083FBAD6743C6797D800A9669BD6FAED38693031A6C16E0A03AAE6903DEB2CEF4B47FFF137CB5399DCB5BFBCFCFF25343","orcidId":"0000-0002-7561-0941","documentHash":"a9235661-fb2e-4102-b6a6-35060d6414c3"},{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a0473984fe","name":"Anna","lastName":"Charuta","uuid":"DF32F451B3CE4DD7B915CE533DD8541C02B7A5A1D70469A795FFCE995CDC06FE2FA51B1B537A6C004D0719A3926F0834CBFD8975EDB39A7E04DF2A1C867DA9ED","orcidId":"0000-0001-9778-9391","documentHash":"db2f63d2-8cc5-4db2-bcdd-9dfbc1d3c065"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a0473975a3","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Słodkowski","uuid":"2993179E060C5C5365001D469EA4511205811C983F4723D65008DF8EAE0866C71702A4027C406E35DFA7A91AE563D5AF44D9845F763D0BD8691E6AE366CF24D8","documentHash":"e8f04876-e9fe-4258-80e8-b9b93c263545"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-12-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"663c75ff4097071b7581c3b4","doi":"10.1016/j.crbiot.2023.100160","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2590262823000424?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The impact of home enteral nutrition planned with the use of indirect calorimetry on the nutritional status and body composition of cancer patients","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\nStudies show that malnutrition is common among cancer patients, ranging from about 20% to more than 70%. It is known that malnutrition that is not managed properly worsens the course of the disease, prolongs the hospital stay, and impacts the quality of life and treatment toxicities. Malnutrition has many negative effects, therefore individualization and optimization of nutritional support is crucial for the patient's health. This study aimed to assess the impact of home enteral nutrition (HEN) planned with the use of indirect calorimetry on the nutritional status and body composition of cancer patients.\nMethods\nThis prospective, observational study included 28 patients with cancer recruited at the Nutrition Clinic of Department of General, Gastroenterologic and Oncologic Surgery, of the Medical University of Warsaw from December 2021 to December 2022. All patients were supported with HEN setup based on individual caloric needs for 3 months. We evaluated nutritional status, body composition, and biochemical markers of malnutrition.\nResults\nFor 67.9 % of patients, using the equations rather than indirect calorimetry would underestimate energy needs. Individualized HEN resulted in weight loss stops in 46.4 % of patients. The average change in body mass in the study group was positive and was equal to 0.46 ± 6.73 kg. No significant differences were found when comparing the mid-arm circumference (MAC) and triceps skinfold thickness (SFT) before and after inclusion in HEN, although, as in the case of body mass SFT showed an upward trend. Moreover, the percentage of patients with insufficient total protein (TP) and serum albumin concentrations decreased. This difference was statistically significant for albumin. The Nutritional Risk Index (NRI) was also significantly higher. The analysis of body composition also showed a decrease in the percentage of patients with reduced fat-free mass (FFM), body cell mass (BCM), and phase angle (PhA) value.\nConclusions\nThe results of our research highlight the significance of well-planned nutritional care for cancer patients. Utilizing HEN and individualized approaches can effectively preserve body mass, composition, and nutritional status while minimizing safety risks, ultimately improving quality of life. Indirect calorimetry if available can be helpful to optimize nutrition care for patients with cancer in HEN."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933b878c28a0473a5603","645c532940e3ff38f8b52cde","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e709288878c28a0473975a3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a0473984fe"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","pagesFromTo":"100160","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663c75ff4097071b7581c3b5","663c75ff4097071b7581c3b6","663c75ff4097071b7581c3b7","663c75ff4097071b7581c3b8","5e709294878c28a0473984fe","5e70933b878c28a0473a5603","645c532940e3ff38f8b52cde","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e709288878c28a0473975a3","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb8b0","mniswId":"30244","title":"Current Research in Biotechnology","eissn":"2590-2628","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c41bc635-e91a-4cae-a581-ffd8f9bb20bb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"660ba69440970773c9ac828f","year":"2024","volume":"7","documentHash":"166abf22-7738-4ffc-8f2b-7a11d61a51e8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Home enteral nutrition","Nutritional status","Body composition","Cancer","Malnutrition","Indirect calorimetry"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060763669"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b70e0fdbe8318b4cdabc3","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Łapiński","documentHash":"99fb6744-025e-4dd1-a33f-57f3bc2dbda8"},{"objectId":"679b70e0fdbe8318b4cdabc2","name":"Artur","lastName":"Stolarczyk","documentHash":"995e3b6e-6c46-4130-bdb8-bc7c1d96bc08"},{"objectId":"679b70e0fdbe8318b4cdabc1","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kamiński","documentHash":"3dbb9fb6-d363-4062-a4e0-827f2588a39a"},{"objectId":"679b70e0fdbe8318b4cdabc0","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Maciąg","documentHash":"cccf009d-902b-43e6-9617-67fbe9bc9baf"},{"objectId":"679b70e0fdbe8318b4cdabbf","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Poniatowska","documentHash":"a86e85e6-7c2a-4780-be01-1a9d5fd1b781"},{"objectId":"679b70e0fdbe8318b4cdabbe","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kamińska","documentHash":"270ea86d-1eda-4ea4-bee4-4a81fe8137a7"},{"objectId":"679b70e0fdbe8318b4cdabbd","name":"Artur","lastName":"Wnuk","documentHash":"0b4a3f14-e92a-4349-a4bb-5212dc478f1d"},{"objectId":"679b70e0fdbe8318b4cdabbc","name":"Olga","lastName":"Adamska","documentHash":"742f2802-c365-4e6a-a116-cd64b6e20065"},{"objectId":"671610cdece39836623b1eff","name":"Maima","lastName":"Matin","uuid":"028B8E8EDCF7D67A78E16C226F937DAAC626533E030CC2CD79DF049C5F6AC008ED2C671E37A5912CDF0CC34E742667D43D8854F7413AC6FB857EBF57B01E355C","documentHash":"52857f92-cb97-439c-860d-0d296c5467a7"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a047399828","name":"Artur","lastName":"Jóżwik","uuid":"BFBE241DDF4B149570AA3703800A25F0CDE93B1C4264239BABF6DF15004F8A1C786FFD25EEBC56546FCC94E0822AD59D94E422B8D8723F693AD042AB30FBBC43","orcidId":"0000-0001-5546-9891","documentHash":"9b809847-eb52-4086-95d8-3c676abd8ef9"}],"objectId":"679b70e0fdbe8318b4cdabbb","doi":"10.3389/fphar.2024.1399719","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1399719/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Melatonin supplementation counteracts fiber loss in knee ligaments of diabetes-induced rats","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent metabolic disease.

Diabetes is a known cause of macro-, microvascular, and diabetic ulcer healing difficulties among tissues. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the healing potential occurring in injured and healthy ligaments among diabetic and healthy individuals using a rat model. We hypothesize that DM may contribute to altering the knee medial collateral ligament (MCL), thus its morphology, biochemical fitness, and functionality. The study cohort consisted of 40 rats. The animals were randomized into four equal groups. Groups I and II (20 rats) received saline subcutaneously and served as controls. Groups III and IV (20 rats) were injected with a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ). All animals underwent surgery to cut the left tibial collateral ligament in the hind limb and suture it. The access site was sutured to create inflammation and study the regenerative capacities of animals with normal carbohydrate metabolism and pharmacologically induced diabetes. Each animal then underwent sham surgery to access and suture the right tibial collateral ligament in the hind limb without ligament intervention. After the animals had undergone surgeries, groups II and IV were given melatonin supplementation for 4 weeks. Rats with DM presented with more fibrosis and calcification of the MCL and decreased healing potential. Treatment with melatonin in diabetic rats mitigated alterations and improved the antioxidant status of ligaments from the diabetic

However, the type of dietary fat may also be a critical risk factor. The study aimed to determine the effect of three months of feeding HFDs with different fatty acid composition on oxidative stress markers and the proteome of mouse kidneys. The study involved 24 Swiss-Webster mice, which were divided into four groups (n = 6) fed for three months a standard chow (STD), an HFD rich in saturated fatty acids (SFA), and HFDs rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids with linoleic acid to α-linolenic acid ratios of 14:1 (HR) or 5:1 (LR). Feeding the SFA and HR diets increased triglyceride levels compared to the STD and LR groups. The HR group also had higher concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances compared to the other groups. There was no effect of HFD on cholesterol concentration and activity of antioxidant enzymes. The SFA diet increased the expression of acyl-CoA thioesterase 2 and D-lactate dehydrogenase, while decreasing that of apolipoprotein E. All HFDs led to downregulation of ATP synthase F1 subunit beta, mitochondrial, while only the LR diet increased the expression of persulphide dioxygenase ETHE1 and electron transfer flavoprotein subunit A, suggesting an enhanced oxidation of fatty acids. Ingestion of the SFA and HR diets caused downregulation of molecular chaperones and upregulation of the inflammation and apoptosis regulator peptidylprolyl isomerase A. In conclusion, feeding SFA and HR diets induces oxidative stress and proteome changes in the mouse kidney. The SFA diet most significantly influenced the expression pattern of proteins related to energetic metabolism."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a8878c28a04739a10f","5e7093bb878c28a0473afeab"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea4","uid":"bdue8IYFHJjfPMqPlXSYxbA","uuid":"30312732-6777-4ca9-84e6-ad3f07bc18c2","name":"Instytut Fizjologii i Żywienia Zwierząt im.

However, further studies are needed to better assess their efficacy and safety. A promising base for research in the field of medicine and additional pharmacovigilance is social networks, in which experience and knowledge are exchanged between researchers, doctors, and patients, as well as information about the potential risks and benefits of using drugs for medical purposes is disseminated. The aim of this study was to investigate the reported efficiency and safety of medical use of cannabinoids in patients using posts on the social media Instagram and analyze the observed trends.\n\nMethods: Social media listening platform Apify was used to collect data with hashtags as of June 4, 2024, including posts from 2023 and 2024, with some data extending into later periods, in compliance with a systematic approach to data collection. The analysis of the data obtained from the research was conducted using the RStudio platform.\n\nResults: The analysis covered 1,466 posts containing hashtags related to cannabinoids. The posts studied were categorized as follows: 33.08% focused on advertising and commercialization, 25.58% on personal experience, 21.35% on other topics, and 19.99% contained educational content. An analysis of overall content relevance found that the majority of Instagram posts (81.79%) related to cannabis and cannabinoid hashtags are relevant. Most of the Instagram posts studied were posters, followed by personal photos and videos. The analysis shows that English dominates the studied category (70.74% of posts), while German, French, Spanish, and other languages also occupy a significant place, emphasizing the importance of a multilingual approach in content analysis. It has been revealed that organizations publish a larger percentage of posts under this study, with a higher percentage of relevance. Personal experience stories receive a significant number of “likes” indicating a strong emotional connection between audience and content. Instagram discussions about cannabinoid treatment support evidence from scientific studies about their effectiveness in treating a range of diseases, such as epilepsy with Lennox–Gastaut and Dravet syndromes, multiple sclerosis, cancer, and HIV-cachexia, nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. At the same time, they emphasize the need for further clinical studies to better assess safety, side effects, and optimal dosages. Advertising and commercial posts can contribute to increased cannabis use, highlighting the need to raise awareness of risks and strengthen preventive measures.\n\nConclusion: Analysis of content on the social media Instagram can complement traditional scientific research by providing information on the real use of cannabis and its derivatives, contributing to the development of safe and effective recommendations for its use."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","671610cdece39836623b1eff"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679b2bc4fdbe8318b4c8e655","679b2bc4fdbe8318b4c8e656","679b2bc4fdbe8318b4c8e657","671610cdece39836623b1eff","679b2bc4fdbe8318b4c8e658","679b2bc4fdbe8318b4c8e659","679b2bc4fdbe8318b4c8e65a","679b2bc4fdbe8318b4c8e65b","679b2bc4fdbe8318b4c8e65c","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1b6","mniswId":"6866","title":"Frontiers in Public Health","issn":"2296-2565","eissn":"2296-2565","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"85d71790-6ae8-4a4c-b282-0621a24b8f7b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66225d3e40970771cc9f3809","year":"2024","volume":"12","documentHash":"689aa25b-b816-480a-b6d2-83cce90cb89c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cannabidiol, cannabinoid, Epidiolex, Instagram, Marinol, Nabilone, Sativex, social media"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060774530"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679a1115fdbe831aedcabf5a","name":"Fabian Peter","lastName":"Hammerle","documentHash":"79325279-9da9-4f4b-b223-02e24e609886"},{"objectId":"679a1115fdbe831aedcabf59","name":"Dalibor","lastName":"Hrg","documentHash":"bc4b673a-110f-463a-80d0-797d88b84d08"},{"objectId":"679a1115fdbe831aedcabf58","name":"Sybille","lastName":"Behrens","documentHash":"c67b6f94-a0e9-4e22-8ce5-63d814de6b1f"},{"objectId":"679a1115fdbe831aedcabf57","name":"Andy Wai Kan","lastName":"Yeung","documentHash":"029aaba1-6608-4b61-8830-ea5f772419b0"},{"objectId":"671610cdece39836623b1eff","name":"Maima","lastName":"Matin","uuid":"028B8E8EDCF7D67A78E16C226F937DAAC626533E030CC2CD79DF049C5F6AC008ED2C671E37A5912CDF0CC34E742667D43D8854F7413AC6FB857EBF57B01E355C","documentHash":"52857f92-cb97-439c-860d-0d296c5467a7"},{"objectId":"612d94299543c7051ff01b28","name":"Michel ","lastName":"Mickael","uuid":"6C0F190719C006F28401303260F31EB975571B3A00976F324446353810A0BEBD070D7D62CAB7367E88BFD3385375A74E21C88497F33459BA7C60F5AA5C3267FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-4186-4900","documentHash":"93399ad0-db2d-4c58-b04e-476d4131aaa8"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"},{"objectId":"5e70933b878c28a0473a5603","name":"Michał","lastName":"Ławiński","uuid":"2DED7D2DB991F9E70EC3CFD116C9753DB94901B541E4EDCC0D64539D0AB2B3067286B6D90BEABC890CEA3F1E25F3FBDDEC7A8E9A52A4332DC40E4C250FAC0B74","orcidId":"0000-0001-6129-7723","documentHash":"1d1c31eb-3c16-4d10-8776-07c1232920ad"}],"objectId":"679a1115fdbe831aedcabf55","doi":"10.3390/publications12030022","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/12/3/22/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Bibliometric Analysis of Papers Dealing with Dental Videos on YouTube","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study was to perform a bibliometric analysis to discover what topics of dental YouTube videos have been investigated by the scientific literature, and evaluate how video characteristics were related to citation count.

Two-stage cluster sampling was applied to herds counting at least 20 adult goats (aged >1 year) and in each herd all males and 10–13 females were tested. At least one seropositive goat regardless of its sex was necessary to consider the herd as infected. HTP was estimated using the Bayesian approach with the Gibbs sampler in the EpiTools and reported as the median and 95 % credibility interval (95 % CrI). A total of 1282 adult goats from 86 herds were serologically tested using two commercial ELISAs (Cp-ELISA and Map-ELISA). At least 1 seropositive result of Cp-ELISA and Map-ELISA was obtained in 73/86 herds (84.9 %) and 40/86 herds (46.5 %), respectively. HTP of CLA was estimated at 73.3 % (95 % CrI: 65.0 %, 80.4 %) and HTP of PTB was estimated at 42.9 % (95 % CrI: 25.8 %, 58.0 %). There was a significant positive association between the occurrence of CLA and PTB in the herds (odds ratio 6.0, 95 % confidence interval: 1.2, 28.8; p = 0.010). Probability of the seropositive result for PTB was also significantly higher in Cp-seropositive goats than in Cp-seronegative goats (odds ratio 3.9, 95 % confidence interval: 2.4, 6.3; p < 0.001) which could indicate either a higher risk of co-infection or a higher rate of false positive results for PTB in Cp-positive goats. To investigate this issue, optical densities obtained in Map-ELISA were compared between Cp-positive and Cp-negative goats and results of Map-ELISA were adjusted accordingly. Map-negative sera from Cp-positive goats turned out to have significantly higher optical densities than Map-negative sera from Cp-negative goats (p < 0.001). After the adjustment, the herd-level apparent seroprevalence of PTB was 41.9 % (36/86 herds) so it still fell within the 95 % CrI of HTP of PTB calculated before the adjustment. Concluding, CLA appears to be widespread in the Polish goat population. In many of them it may be subclinical at the moment, however will likely emerge in the future as the disease follows cyclic pattern in Poland. On the other hand, given the total lack of clinical PTB in Polish goats, an explanation for a high HTP of PTB remains unclear and warrants further studies using tests of higher analytical specificity than ELISA."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923a878c28a0473920cf","6730eabefdbe83034937181b","6730eabefdbe830349371812","6730eabefdbe830349371811","6730eabefdbe830349371814","6730eabefdbe830349371813","6730eabefdbe830349371816","6730eabefdbe830349371815","6730eabefdbe830349371818","6730eabefdbe830349371817"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929f878c28a04739966f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"230","pagesFromTo":"1-9","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6730eabefdbe830349371811","6730eabefdbe830349371812","6730eabefdbe830349371813","6730eabefdbe830349371814","6730eabefdbe830349371815","6730eabefdbe830349371816","5e70923a878c28a0473920cf","6730eabefdbe830349371817","6730eabefdbe830349371818","6730eabefdbe830349371819","6730eabefdbe83034937181a","6730eabefdbe83034937181b","6730eabefdbe83034937181c","5e70929f878c28a04739966f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c28514547936d","mniswId":"16474","title":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","issn":"0167-5877","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c92471ff-caf5-4565-a7ba-88bb7a12841c"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis","Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis","Johne’s disease","CLA","iceberg diseases","Bayesian analysis","PTB"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060777786"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6756d7cffdbe833c07e75b0c","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Stokłosa","documentHash":"f58ce7c6-3df6-4a99-a537-0c79c3a9956c"},{"objectId":"6756d7cffdbe833c07e75b0b","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Słodkowski","documentHash":"e8e4c97c-f7e3-4335-ac41-b511d80e7361"},{"objectId":"6756d7cffdbe833c07e75b0a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Woźniak","documentHash":"a343d8d1-9c15-4120-bbef-682c3c65a5b3"},{"objectId":"6756d7cffdbe833c07e75b08","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Śliwczyński","documentHash":"37c15282-3cac-4286-bdda-eeef108b562c"},{"objectId":"6756d7cffdbe833c07e75b07","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Chmiel","documentHash":"29b39eda-44d0-433a-8ddc-d841e5269294"},{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b7584","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Kraj","uuid":"6B4FAB5B4E469EAC77112DE2CEE3684F19D09BEEAFF12D6B9CB8103391BE63C52E7FB31D181872B9A10946110649EBD5AC6C690BB0CBFC8DA25C6F4F31E623D7","documentHash":"1ddd2dfd-60da-4a20-88fc-557803050450"},{"objectId":"5e7093fb878c28a0473b458d","name":"Lucjan","lastName":"Wyrwicz","uuid":"1FA6D659E22940715FEB58E2425ABFA3C77D19D9113E38E51B62FF8523073EB2AFB1E60C848CF2ABF980407C5A1DA3BCDEDB71FCF82D62B4B5078903560FFA22","documentHash":"0a29283e-2d59-403b-a7ae-0c88ab733021"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"92D7C04F8AB3A7BAFDD427A486DDA8E51BB9EF910CE1748A4A41C1B5DD9D2FBC73939751C42B68AF9AB4431CFBC5570C935A57B7BE63B7045AA234AF1888672B","documentHash":"da59b83b-fda3-4817-8136-ba0e1298aa2f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6756d7cffdbe833c07e75b05","doi":"10.1007/s00432-024-05962-5","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00432-024-05962-5.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Synergistic effects of calcium channel blockers and renin-angiotensin inhibitors with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy on the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: Pancreatic cancer remains a significant public health challenge, with poor long-term outcomes due to the lack of effective treatment options. Repurposing commonly used clinical drugs, such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, CCBs, and metformin, may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy and offer a promising therapeutic strategy for improving patient outcomes.\n\nMethods: A retrospective analysis of concomitant treatment with ACE-Is, ARBs, CCBs, and metformin alongside gemcitabine chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer was conducted. Treatment responses were evaluated, with overall survival (OS) estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Additionally, the Cox proportional hazards model was employed to assess the impact of these specific agents on patient survival.\n\nResults: 4628 patients with various stages of pancreatic cancer were identified in the database between 2007 and 2016. The estimated overall survival (OS) in the analyzed group was 6.9 months (95% CI 6.4-7). The use of any of the analyzed drugs was associated with a significant improvement in mOS of 7.5 months (95% CI 6.8-7.8) vs. 6.7 months (95% CI 6.4-7.0) for patients who did not have additional treatment (p < 0.0001). ARBs, ACE-Is, CCBs, and metformin varied in their effectiveness in prolonging mOS among patients. The longest mOS of 8.9 months (95% CI 7.7-11.6) was observed in patients receiving additional therapy with ARBs, while the shortest mOS of 7.7 months (95% CI 6.5-8.9) was achieved by patients receiving metformin. In the adjusted Cox analysis, metformin was associated with a significantly weaker effect on mOS (p = 0.029). A particularly interesting trend in prolonging 5-year survival was demonstrated by ARBs and CCBs with 14.1% (95% CI 9-22%) and 14.8% (95% CI 11.1-19.6%), respectively, compared to patients not taking these drugs, who achieved a 5-year OS of 3.8% (95% CI 3.2-4.4%).\n\nConclusion: Our results demonstrate a significant positive impact of ARBs, ACE inhibitors, and CCBs on survival in patients with pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine. The addition of these inexpensive and relatively safe drugs in patients with additional comorbidities may represent a potential therapeutic option in this indication. However, prospective clinical trials to evaluate the optimal patient population and further studies to determine the potential impact of these agents on chemotherapy are necessary."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709428878c28a0473b7584","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"150","issue":"9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709428878c28a0473b7584","6756d7cffdbe833c07e75b07","6756d7cffdbe833c07e75b08","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","6756d7cffdbe833c07e75b0a","6756d7cffdbe833c07e75b0b","6756d7cffdbe833c07e75b0c","5e7093fb878c28a0473b458d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478518","mniswId":"10385","title":"Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology","issn":"0171-5216","eissn":"1432-1335","documentHash":"cb0eed60-e362-4cdd-9153-a01b7424e4ba"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6745bde7fdbe832eab944cb8","year":"2024","volume":"150","number":"9","documentHash":"f9c8a235-ac00-45ae-ad5d-eaeb5a6267ed"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060777794"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"672b69fbfdbe83748a7d2643","name":"Tomas","lastName":"Vanecek","documentHash":"c2dc2386-1392-4613-89ba-ca21c1743430"},{"objectId":"672b69fbfdbe83748a7d2642","name":"Michael","lastName":"Michal","documentHash":"3bcecd51-49fb-4dce-b1b9-e31d83a62476"},{"objectId":"672b69fbfdbe83748a7d2641","name":"Nikko","lastName":"Floretes","documentHash":"7e489d9e-142d-4eba-9cea-010c925951a6"},{"objectId":"672b69fbfdbe83748a7d2640","name":"Petr","lastName":"Martinek","documentHash":"dd58c8fb-6d83-4d70-8ba6-5a75ede3ae11"},{"objectId":"672b69fbfdbe83748a7d263f","name":"Norwin","lastName":"Kubick","documentHash":"520cef8d-d788-4140-9a30-e69495466ed5"},{"objectId":"612d94299543c7051ff01b28","name":"Michel ","lastName":"Mickael","uuid":"6C0F190719C006F28401303260F31EB975571B3A00976F324446353810A0BEBD070D7D62CAB7367E88BFD3385375A74E21C88497F33459BA7C60F5AA5C3267FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-4186-4900","documentHash":"93399ad0-db2d-4c58-b04e-476d4131aaa8"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b88f0","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"RELIGA","uuid":"4A8129FF0F6619E97E61063CBDF8E25F587C90BE1D75787A36ABF437AC995FA129B27FB6C8D3550F8BB02A5E062C9A27B924F9A2BC2077B6D82DCBAD3EA5E03E","documentHash":"8fcd021c-0e04-4fbd-a6a0-e50758140644"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Sacharczuk","uuid":"8E2CFC97D0176907FD3FDCC1CB83621D26B1BE05F486A6134D990E8B18DF3BF8E8F3AADDCDC1D73F10233B59A74445730E291963FD429C8698BFDF373BA38AEF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6309-5292","documentHash":"fc3da1d3-82af-4442-a191-158025188e29"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399193","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Horbańczuk","uuid":"976205AE9A3DD4FA85531EB44854AE0083FBAD6743C6797D800A9669BD6FAED38693031A6C16E0A03AAE6903DEB2CEF4B47FFF137CB5399DCB5BFBCFCFF25343","orcidId":"0000-0002-7561-0941","documentHash":"a9235661-fb2e-4102-b6a6-35060d6414c3"},{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a047395b29","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Paszkiewicz","uuid":"1E0F12385F9AD76A76EA403D6F117EF84B96E908EA501E09048179621B70445EE3762FD919D76049F1986ED7442F7B6BBFD20C030BBD521C99D626F2FF401F8A","orcidId":"0000-0002-3182-493X","documentHash":"b703ff0b-ac20-42ec-a8c8-e3ce0696110c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"672b69fbfdbe83748a7d263e","doi":"10.3390/cimb46080490","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/46/8/490","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Using Copy Number Variation Data and Neural Networks to Predict Cancer Metastasis Origin Achieves High Area under the Curve Value with a Trade-Off in Precision","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The accurate identification of the primary tumor origin in metastatic cancer cases is crucial for guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. Copy number alterations (CNAs) and copy number variation (CNV) have emerged as valuable genomic markers for predicting the origin of metastases. However, current models that predict cancer type based on CNV or CNA suffer from low AUC values. To address this challenge, we employed a cutting-edge neural network approach utilizing a dataset comprising CNA profiles from twenty different cancer types. We developed two workflows: the first evaluated the performance of two deep neural networks—one ReLU-based and the other a 2D convolutional network. In the second workflow, we stratified cancer types based on anatomical and physiological classifications, constructing shallow neural networks to differentiate between cancer types within the same cluster. Both approaches demonstrated high AUC values, with deep neural networks achieving a precision of 60%, suggesting a mathematical relationship between CNV type, location, and cancer type. Our findings highlight the potential of using CNA/CNV to aid pathologists in accurately identifying cancer origins with accessible clinical tests."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e70929c878c28a047399193"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","uid":"b8lEq4e8f8p1V09_nBsO4Ew","uuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","name":"Akademia Bialska im.

A hashtag analysis of #GlobalHealth disparities on X","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: X (Formerly known as Twitter) healthcare hashtags are a popular healthcare informatics and educational tool among medical professionals. #Globalhealth is one such widely used hashtag with extensive engagement. This study analyses #GlobalHealth to understand its pattern, global digital distribution, and other parameters during the COVID-19 pandemic on X.\n\nMethods: Data was collected by utilizing posts using #GlobalHealth on X from 1st December 2019 to 1st November 2022. The analysis was performed using Symplur Signals to assess several parameters, such as the cumulative number of posts, impressions, category of users, co-occurring hashtags, and geolocation. The Symplur Rank system was used to assess the impact of influencers using the hashtag.\n\nResults: A total of 843,762 posts were shared by 150,408 X users, with 4,639,144,304 impressions. Most posts (73.8%) were made by unclassified accounts, followed by doctors (4.2%), followed by other health workers. The #COVID19 was the most common co-occurring hashtag (43%). The top locations and the most influential X users came from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Among the top 25 most influential handles, a maximum (N = 09) were based in the United States—most profiles (N = 10) were categorized as international organizations followed by journals (N = 03).\n\nConclusion: The study gives a glimpse into the discrepancies in global distribution and stakeholders of #GlobalHealth. Most posts originated from the global north, which hints at how the trend to #GlobalHealth is not perhaps as global as it is thought to be, and it also reflects upon the real-world scenarios in the context of Global Health Equity.

However, clinical trials are yet to show any promising results,\nindicating the need for further research into the mechanisms behind Treg dysfunction. We used\nnext-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of five datasets comprising of bulk RNA-seq and\nsingle-cell RNA-seq data to explore our research question. Our results identified Acod1 (Aconitate\nDecarboxylase 1) as a primary mediator of Treg suppression of immune cells as well as various\nmetabolic pathways regulated by IL4 and IL10. scRNA-seq analysis showed that Acod1 and FoxP3\nwere localised in the same Treg-like cells. Further evidence from our study further suggests a mutual\npositive regulation loop between Acod1 and FoxP3 in sepsis. Additionally, CD36 was identified as\na downstream target of Acod1. CD36 is a known metabolite regulator in Tregs, where it functions\nas a transporter of long fatty chains (LCFA) and is regulated by IL4 and IL10. Taken together,\nour results indicate that the metabolic CD36/Acod1 axis could be responsible for the continuous\nactivation of Treg in sepsis. Thus, targeting this axis could prove valuable in improving the sepsis\nprognosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5e70933b878c28a0473a5603","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e70929c878c28a047399193"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"42","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"189-202","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28","6799f264fdbe831aedc8e811","6799f264fdbe831aedc8e812","5e70929c878c28a047399193","6799f264fdbe831aedc8e813","6799f264fdbe831aedc8e814","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e70933b878c28a0473a5603"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547703a","mniswId":"1152","title":"Animal Science Papers and Reports","issn":"0860-4037","eissn":"2300-8342","websiteLink":"http://www.ighz.edu.pl/?p0=5&p1=34","documentHash":"62bc8bc1-ac27-4424-b0f7-d62320584c68"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"668bcf1dfdbe8315e75393c8","year":"2024","volume":"42","number":"2","documentHash":"49d1836e-6f31-47fd-ab0a-6d1669fe2c99"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SEPSIS; Th17; Treg; inflammation; long fatty chains; CD36"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060787646"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679c8077fdbe830b35f67ba6","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Zadka","documentHash":"8ae82887-225b-4df5-b411-173bd11e997b"},{"objectId":"64c9bfa940e3ff494b566a65","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Ksepka","uuid":"35F8D256E1AA0C391C2649CD058CD4B617315655F1A763BEEFB8E5E746596133CDF768D4A9242CE6C872F2FBBEE7D89AAB7F3BD7FCB4D2B9B1CF9DD6B8DAE2E5","documentHash":"40c9e3b0-c7fe-4325-ab66-30d6cdea364e"},{"objectId":"612d94299543c7051ff01b28","name":"Michel ","lastName":"Mickael","uuid":"6C0F190719C006F28401303260F31EB975571B3A00976F324446353810A0BEBD070D7D62CAB7367E88BFD3385375A74E21C88497F33459BA7C60F5AA5C3267FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-4186-4900","documentHash":"93399ad0-db2d-4c58-b04e-476d4131aaa8"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"},{"objectId":"5e70933b878c28a0473a5603","name":"Michał","lastName":"Ławiński","uuid":"2DED7D2DB991F9E70EC3CFD116C9753DB94901B541E4EDCC0D64539D0AB2B3067286B6D90BEABC890CEA3F1E25F3FBDDEC7A8E9A52A4332DC40E4C250FAC0B74","orcidId":"0000-0001-6129-7723","documentHash":"1d1c31eb-3c16-4d10-8776-07c1232920ad"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399193","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Horbańczuk","uuid":"976205AE9A3DD4FA85531EB44854AE0083FBAD6743C6797D800A9669BD6FAED38693031A6C16E0A03AAE6903DEB2CEF4B47FFF137CB5399DCB5BFBCFCFF25343","orcidId":"0000-0002-7561-0941","documentHash":"a9235661-fb2e-4102-b6a6-35060d6414c3"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a0473975a3","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Słodkowski","uuid":"2993179E060C5C5365001D469EA4511205811C983F4723D65008DF8EAE0866C71702A4027C406E35DFA7A91AE563D5AF44D9845F763D0BD8691E6AE366CF24D8","documentHash":"e8f04876-e9fe-4258-80e8-b9b93c263545"}],"objectId":"679c8077fdbe830b35f67ba4","doi":"10.1016/j.nut.2024.112636","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0899900724002855?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Predictive equations in determining resting energy expenditure in patients with head and neck cancer receiving home enteral nutrition","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective\nIt is important to cover energy targets among patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) to minimize weight and skeletal muscles loss. This study aimed to assess the agreement between indirect calorimetry (IC) and predictive equations for determining resting energy expenditures (REE) in HNC patients receiving home enteral nutrition (HEN).\nResearch methods and procedures\nPatients included in the study had to be diagnosed with HNC, be adults, have artificial access to the digestive tract, and participate in HEN. All measurements were conducted in the morning after prior patient preparation. Body weight and height were measured using a scale with an integrated height meter. A phase-sensitive, single-frequency bioimpedance analyzer was utilized to conduct bioelectrical impedance analysis. REE was measured using IC with a canopy hood and calculated using 27 different equations. Differences between variables were analyzed using appropriate t-tests and their nonparametric counterparts. The Bland-Altman test was used to assess the types of differences between measured REE (mREE) and predicted REE (pREE).\nResults\nThe examined patients (n = 71, 73.2% male) had a mean age of 63.99 ± 11.42 years and a BMI of 22.84 ± 3.59 kg/m2. The most common diagnosis was malignant tongue cancer. Most patients had stage III cancer. Treatment included surgery combined with radiotherapy or only chemoradiotherapy in most cases. The median duration of treatment and HEN was 206 days and 97 days, respectively. Men had a significantly higher REE than women. The Owen, Fredrix, Ireton–Jones, Korth, Weijs–Kruizenga, and Marraw,h equations estimated REE without significant statistical differences from IC and showed the smallest percentage error between pREE and mREE. The Korth equation had the smallest average mean difference between pREE and mREE, reducing the REE value average by 7 ± 274 kcal/day. The highest percentage of individual accurate predictions for pREE was obtained with the Fredrix (48%), Weijs–Kruizenga (48%), Korth (45%), and MarraPhA (45%) equations.\nConclusion(s)\nThe predictive equations examined in this study cannot replace IC for determining REE in HNC patients at the individual level. When equations are used, special attention should be given to planning HEN to account for possible discrepancies between pREE and mREE."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5e70933b878c28a0473a5603","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e70929c878c28a047399193","64c9bfa940e3ff494b566a65","5e709288878c28a0473975a3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"131","pagesFromTo":"112636","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70933b878c28a0473a5603","64c9bfa940e3ff494b566a65","612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e709288878c28a0473975a3","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","679c8077fdbe830b35f67ba6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a3","mniswId":"15296","title":"Nutrition","issn":"0899-9007","documentHash":"aba0da59-a04c-4c8c-b9cc-b17c7d3ad858"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679c8077fdbe830b35f67ba5","year":"2025","volume":"131","documentHash":"53db614a-0309-4d38-9c8c-c55f93511d6b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Indirect calorimetry; Predictive equations; Head and neck cancer; Home enteral nutrition; Resting energy expenditure"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060787728"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"617e0db87523400564d62e5b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kostusiak","uuid":"E44C651AF7B112EF89210EF2A48E5CC9C383089C74D82AEE233509C82E8AA58C3915E7D60BEFD2E3E67EC9D083E059FA0B8E3108FF714EF603B8F2A2295C9065","documentHash":"5382c511-5114-44e2-87cd-d4dc35003a5e"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c1219","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Puppel","uuid":"DEFEB63897F4F677A6CACA13ABFD34912211F95BF6CE2238766912236D9783431A6B9E42EDC1245BBBA673896CBE70F00EA48A69C1CE2BD9C9854DCE4DC2AEF9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2909-2087","documentHash":"d972e1dc-9c57-4327-bd08-47b85900ff9f"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Sakowski","uuid":"C87300CD8C2E2C660E7BA7643D2648CA6260BCA2F36C89DE3CE9CA734753DCBC23AA717DC64FD468245A05CBE16B5C43FBA0570AE5ECA8CFC6CBF48252E899D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-2264-4638","documentHash":"cfaaf5aa-3854-4022-a3c5-b8e2e8624a3e"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739243e","name":"Jan","lastName":"Slósarz","uuid":"38B15DEE9EFDE400D2DBCC3E239D9097D02F1092EEFF364624F890250436AAC10C23D8B77C00A81FCC286F929669C3C98EB19C807812C0378E15C7BACEE3DFB7","orcidId":"0000-0002-5254-3993","documentHash":"6925a48d-0bcd-4d5a-93af-46e99a95477a"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739242b","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Gołębiewski","uuid":"E0571A2599BAA13E2D0F0789A64421D0D0CA49DE019A5BCAF3CB7ADE6F5D674058AFAA4560A9879B9BAB3B2B650B7B7C6F9346150BECF48A566D6F546E79A3B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-0645-433X","documentHash":"bf6f9482-28bb-4cc8-a602-916803d95c81"}],"objectId":"65621cb940970749a8ce2084","doi":"10.3390/ani13162603","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/16/2603","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Relationship between Beef Quality and Bull Breed","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The beef industry in Poland heavily relies on the Polish Holstein-Friesian (PHF) breed, known for its primary use in dairy production, but which also contributes significantly to the beef supply. In contrast, the Limousine (LM), Hereford (HH), and Charolaise (CH) breeds have gained popularity due to their ideal specialized characteristics for beef production. As PHF continues to dominate the beef market, a thorough comparison of its beef quality and nutritional attributes with the three most popular beef breeds in Poland is essential. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by conducting a rigorous comparison. The experiment was carried out on the beef from 67 bulls kept in a free-stall system with standardized feeding. The highest total antioxidant status (TAS) was found in CH and was 147.5% higher than that in PHF. Also, compared with PHF, a large difference of 70% was observed in LM, while in HH it was only 6.25%. For degree of antioxidant potential (DAP), the highest concentration was found in LM, while CH had a slightly lower score than LM. PHF had the lowest scores for each of the analyzed parameters of protein fraction. For anserine, taurine, creatinine, and creatine content, the highest results were found for LM. For carnosine and coenzyme Q10, the highest values were found for CH. Overall, these results highlight the impact of maturity and breed on carcass composition and quality. Late-maturing breeds, such as LM and CH, tend to exhibit leaner carcasses with superior fatty acid profiles and antioxidant properties. This knowledge is valuable for producers, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding breed selection and production strategies to meet specific market demands for beef with the desired composition and quality.

A total of 8354 adult goats (aged >1 year) from 165 herds located in various regions of Poland were serologically tested using a commercial ELISA. One hundred twenty eight herds were randomly selected while 37 were enrolled based on convenience non-random sampling. At least 1 seropositive result was obtained in 103 / 165 herds. For all these herds the probability that they were truly positive (herd-level positive predictive value) was calculated. It was ≥ 90% in 91 seropositive herds and 73% to < 90% in 12 herds in which only 1–4 goats were seropositive (22 goats in total). The seropositive goats in the latter herds were retested using a different commercial ELISA and 14 goats (9 males and 5 females) from 9 herds were confirmed to be seropositive (serial testing). The true herd-level seroprevalence was estimated at 61% (95% confidence interval [CI 95%]: 53%–68%). It differed significantly between herd size classes (p = 0.003): the highest prevalences were found in the medium (51 – 100 adult goats) and large herds (>100 adult goats) – 72% (CI 95%: 56–84%) and 86% (CI 95%: 67%–95%), respectively, while prevalences in very small (≤ 20 adult goats) and small herds (21 – 50 adult goats) were 46% (CI 95%: 34%–59%) and 57% (CI 95%: 43%–70%), respectively. The true herd-level seroprevalence differed significantly also between geographical regions of Poland (p = 0.003), with the highest values in the north-western and the lowest in the southern region of the country. The true within-herd seroprevalence estimated using a Bayesian approach ranged from 0.7% to 100% with the median (IQR) of 42% (17%–84%), and did not vary significantly between herd size classes (p = 0.393) or geographical regions of Poland (p = 0.570). Concluding, SRLV infection is widespread in the Polish goat population, the north-western region of Poland is most extensively infected, and herds counting > 50 adult goats are more often infected."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej

Sucrosomial® Iron (SI) is an oral iron formulation of ferric pyrophosphate with high\nbioavailability and tolerability. This research compared the iron status of preterm and full-term piglets and\nevaluated the effects of SI on iron homeostasis in the early postnatal period. Eighteen preterm piglets (born\nvia cesarean section on gestation day 109) and twelve full-term piglets (natural birth) were divided into five\ngroups (n = 6 piglets per group): full-term/preterm piglets without iron supplementation, full-term/preterm\npiglets supplemented with SI (2 mg Fe per piglet per day, days 4–10), and preterm piglets supplemented with\nferrous sulfate (2 mg Fe per piglet per day, days 4–10). Samples were collected on day 11. Preterm piglets\nshowed poor growth and low total body iron content, and they developed iron deficiency anemia, as indicated\nby decreased red blood cell indices and plasma iron parameters. The iron deficiency was partially\nimproved by SI supplementation. Interestingly, higher hepatic and splenic non-heme iron content,\naccompanied by increased tissue and plasma ferritin, were found in preterm piglets compared to full-term\npiglets. SI also contributed to tissue iron accumulation in preterm piglets. Functional iron deficiency and iron\naccumulation in tissues make the regulation of iron metabolism in preterm piglets different from that in fullterm\nones. SI can alleviate the negative effects of iron imbalances caused by premature birth by regulating the\nhepcidin–ferroportin axis. In addition, SI did not induce inflammatory or oxidative responses, and its effects\nare comparable to those of the classic iron supplement, ferrous sulfate. These results indicate that SI is a\npromising iron supplement for improving the iron status of premature infants."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67ff5e51fdbe83559c23b4a4","67ff5e51fdbe83559c23b4a3","67ff5e51fdbe83559c23b4a6","67ff5e51fdbe83559c23b4a5","67ff5e51fdbe83559c23b4ae","67ff5e51fdbe83559c23b4ab","67ff5e51fdbe83559c23b4aa"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea4","uid":"bdue8IYFHJjfPMqPlXSYxbA","uuid":"30312732-6777-4ca9-84e6-ad3f07bc18c2","name":"Instytut Fizjologii i Żywienia Zwierząt im.

Bregs were demonstrated to possess a regulatory effect on B cells. Various subsets of Bregs have been identified including T2-MZP, MZ, B10, IL10-producing plasma cells, IL10 producing plasmablasts, immature IL10 producing B cells, TIM1, and Br1. It is known that B cells have evolved during fish emergence. However, the origin of Bregs is still not known. Three main models have been previously proposed to describe the origin of Bregs, the first known as single–single (SS) suggests that each type of Bregs subpopulation has emerged from a single pre-Breg type. The second model (single–multi) (SM) assumes that a single Bregs gave rise to multiple types of Bregs that in turn differentiated to other Breg subpopulations. In the third model (multi–multi) (MM), it is hypothesized that Bregs arise from the nearest B cell phenotype. The link between the differentiation of cells and the evolution of novel types of cells is known to follow one of three evolutionary patterns (i.e., homology, convergence, or concerted evolution). Another aspect that controls differentiation and evolution processes is the principle of optimization of energy, which suggests that an organism will always use the choice that requires less energy expenditure for survival. In this review, we investigate the evolution of Breg subsets. We studied the feasibility of Breg origination models based on evolution and energy constraints. In conclusion, our review indicates that Bregs are likely to have evolved under a combination of SM–MM models. This combination ensured successful survival in harsh conditions by following the least costly differentiation pathway, as well as adapting to changing environmental conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt

study centered on detecting potentially anti-inflammatory active constituents in ethanolic extracts of Chinese Lonicera species by taking an UHPLC-HRMS-based metabolite profiling approach. Extracts from eight different Lonicera species were subjected to both UHPLC-HRMS analysis and to pharmacological testing in three different cellular inflammation-related assays. Compounds exhibiting high correlations in orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) of pharmacological and MS data served as potentially activity-related candidates. Of these candidates, 65 were tentatively or unambiguously annotated. 7-Hydroxy-5,3',4',5'-tetramethoxyflavone and three bioflavonoids, as well as three C32- and one C34-acetylated polyhydroxy fatty acid, were isolated from Lonicera hypoglauca leaves for the first time, and their structures were fully or partially elucidated. Of the potentially active candidate compounds, 15 were subsequently subjected to pharmacological testing. Their activities could be experimentally verified in part, emphasizing the relevance of Lonicera species as a source of anti-inflammatory active constituents. However, some compounds also impaired the cell viability. Overall, the approach was found useful to narrow down the number of potentially bioactive constituents in the complex extracts investigated. In the future, the application of more refined concepts, such as extract prefractionation combined with bio-chemometrics, may help to further enhance the reliability of candidate selection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"288","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646db6f4409707704047d3ea","646db6f4409707704047d3eb","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","646db6f4409707704047d3ec","646db6f4409707704047d3ed","646db6f4409707704047d3ee","646db6f4409707704047d3ef","646db6f4409707704047d3f0","646db6f4409707704047d3f1","646db6f4409707704047d3f2","646db6f4409707704047d3f3","646db6f4409707704047d3f4","646db6f4409707704047d3f5","646db6f4409707704047d3f6","646db6f4409707704047d3f7","646db6f4409707704047d3f8","646db6f4409707704047d3f9","646db6f4409707704047d3fa","646db6f4409707704047d3fb","646db6f4409707704047d3fc","646db6f4409707704047d3fd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cc94","mniswId":"14259","title":"Metabolites","doi":"","issn":"2218-1989","eissn":"2218-1989","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"464a3a73-a16a-4c16-8fb1-19b1307b8cf0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6336b89240970714162932dc","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"0cf1b23d-30c9-4b4a-b9c6-cfaa9577a84e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lonicera","OPLS-DA","UHPLC-HRMS","anti-inflammatory","honeysuckle","metabolite profiling","multivariate data analysis","traditional Chinese medicine"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747347496193"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658ecba24097076c145d3460","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Młodziński","documentHash":"723c46bf-8343-4164-8d57-bf740df11e30"},{"objectId":"60c348c19543c723365443ab","name":"Michał","lastName":"Świątczak","uuid":"A471D65D0FD39F918B931865C486363D09BACE402C2AF0D9A5DF7E878E49621C3FA5684DECF069F8BF4A724DE30B85FC8973B9F3607B93A77841AE22946773DC","documentHash":"18fa07ae-52a3-4524-ad37-639ef71db502"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bbf8d","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Raczak","uuid":"B9A90F62E388A73A7EB0E9FEE02BB6EB22ABEA92B264A4C666C4A434368DDBFB70CAF53F9422CDFF0C5516F9BC1F365ECCF3EE3E290A3099626669789DB8471D","orcidId":"0000-0001-8987-0210","documentHash":"b54ca7d9-843a-4c2f-9963-40d092ebc19c"},{"objectId":"5e70937c878c28a0473aacf4","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Sikorska","uuid":"3BB7A589A04F3F2D5EB882A90E1EA6BA5044C59245255D38FD9F62118EDAB4E906C92595F17C671E3F0AB1EEC2D9CF00C342E6D66D10E6692DF2DF6A7A107127","orcidId":"0000-0001-5678-5669","documentHash":"562ef819-d88a-4f18-9eb3-941733fb19f5"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aaae3","name":"Ludmiła","lastName":"Daniłowicz-Szymanowicz","uuid":"FDB75163F3530EDF244D0E0194A56F605DBD1F4DCFD4C10FF97D095427C85B13ED163E904B0458073F125A8ACC7B8DD47312B1728492D3080B7336D227344F8E","orcidId":"0000-0002-2269-1880","documentHash":"d4f8ab0e-fcc1-4eab-b20f-a6b44ae69e30"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a089","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Lipiński","uuid":"BCCC6B21A54FA315E0C3F05DC1D0C84CB0F385F3AF4E23DA6FFD956566D90DB89DEB2F844EC16D63080D453979A263B6FD3FEDF51BDD3920953F0EA76106A6BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-0121-4460","documentHash":"5def7195-da0a-4996-ae51-d628c0a7841d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646f5836409707768b5f6418","doi":"10.3390/diagnostics12092057","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/12/9/2057/htm","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Chronic fatigue syndrome in patients with deteriorated iron metabolism","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fatigue is a common, non-specific symptom that often impairs patients’ quality of life.

Thus, there has been much research activity aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms of regulating ABCA1 expression. In this review, we first discuss ABCA1 structure, tissue distribution, cellular localization, and trafficking, as well as its function. Furthermore, current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of ABCA1 expression is summarized. ABCA1 transcriptional regulation is mediated by a very complicated system, including nuclear receptor systems, factors binding to other sites in the ABCA1 promoter, cytokines, hormones, growth factors, lipid metabolites, enzymes, and other messengers/factors/pathways. In addition, ABCA1 posttranscriptional regulation is mediated by microRNA, long noncoding RNA, RNA-binding proteins, proteases, fatty acids, PDZ proteins, signaling proteins, and other factors. Compared to the transcriptional regulation of ABCA1, which is well established, the post-transcriptional regulation of ABCA1 expression is poorly understood."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"170-191","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646dcbe3409707704048faa8","646dcbe3409707704048faa9","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454778c5","mniswId":"4797","title":"Current Protein and Peptide Science","issn":"1389-2037","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"6bb76b98-fabc-483e-8a82-a70611b95aca"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Transporter","atherosclerosis","cardiovascular disease","mRNA","post-transcriptional regulation","transcriptional regulation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747347496209"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646f5677409707768b5f2094","name":"Alexandra L.","lastName":"Whittaker","documentHash":"46d48a76-4e02-4726-bea0-7977834183ad"},{"objectId":"646f5677409707768b5f2093","name":"Maria Camila","lastName":"Ceballos","documentHash":"5c5527bd-c1b3-42d6-9312-a41db6484560"},{"objectId":"646f5677409707768b5f2092","name":"Jen-Yun","lastName":"Chou","documentHash":"e47cefee-420b-4314-b35b-c5cbfb6c7003"},{"objectId":"646f5677409707768b5f2091","name":"Huw D.R.","lastName":"Golledge","documentHash":"edf74fbf-89b7-47f8-8406-281a8f27469d"},{"objectId":"646f5677409707768b5f2090","name":"Péter","lastName":"Pongrácz","documentHash":"11e8d8ee-985f-4faf-8875-b5f125e6168e"},{"objectId":"646f5677409707768b5f208f","name":"Birte L.","lastName":"Nielsen","documentHash":"3bbcd56b-7cef-4f9f-b03f-c9ed2c638c68"},{"objectId":"646f5677409707768b5f208e","name":"I.

Although ethics review mechanisms within institutions are long established in many regions, processes may be non-uniform across different cultures, institutions, and geographical contexts. Harmonisation need not be the ultimate goal; instead, attention should be directed towards ways of improving ethics assessment with an animal-centred focus. Moreover, applied animal behaviour and welfare research sometimes involves human subjects (e.g., animal owners, farmers, caretakers, and consumers), the ethics of which is scarcely discussed. The International Society for Applied Ethology (ISAE) has developed and revised its ethics guidelines to be applied to research articles submitted to the Society’s journal and conferences, and acknowledges the need to address this increasingly contentious issue from a global perspective. At the 2021 ISAE Annual Congress, a workshop on the ethical challenges in animal behaviour and welfare research was held twice. Participants (N ≈ 70) from several continents were presented with hypothetical research cases outlining different ethics scenarios. These scenarios were discussed in small groups, with each participant contributing experiences from their respective countries. More questions than answers were generated, and the mere action of involving researchers from different scientific cultures in a conversation is an important step towards greater insight and transparency. Significant variability in local ethics review requirements across jurisdictions was revealed. However, by focussing on improving transparency of reporting for both animal and human involvement in studies, particularly in the ethics statement and procedure description, ethics assessment by reviewers and editors can be enhanced. There is a need for continued dialogue on ethics within the animal behaviour and welfare research community."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"253","pagesFromTo":"105658","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646f5677409707768b5f208e","646f5677409707768b5f208f","5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","646f5677409707768b5f2090","646f5677409707768b5f2091","646f5677409707768b5f2092","646f5677409707768b5f2093","646f5677409707768b5f2094"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477110","mniswId":"1437","title":"APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE","issn":"0168-1591","eissn":"1872-9045","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3de7508a-a0a2-4ae7-b8f3-c5f835c11dde"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646f5677409707768b5f208d","year":"2022","volume":"253","documentHash":"cab5da49-6a20-4b1c-86f9-017d397a850b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Animal ethics","Animal experiments","Ethics review","Human ethics","invasive procedures"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747347496223"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646c8a0a409707691c4e3397","name":"Reena","lastName":"Gupta","documentHash":"36eb5a48-98b0-460c-b6e4-14571837529e"},{"objectId":"646c8a0a409707691c4e3396","name":"Qushmua","lastName":"Alzahrani","documentHash":"37bf9a5e-7be2-457f-9bb1-fa3976c969d0"},{"objectId":"646c8a0a409707691c4e3395","name":"Monica","lastName":"Gulati","documentHash":"12286293-6cbb-4736-b768-0bca179dc591"},{"objectId":"646c8a0a409707691c4e3394","name":"Bhupinder","lastName":"Kapoor","documentHash":"1079b3be-2bd5-4931-a4ad-f40baa3e9de1"},{"objectId":"646c8a0a409707691c4e3393","name":"Pooja","lastName":"Rani","documentHash":"510160da-6d6f-4ef6-a6fa-b42fb90ca76e"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"646c8a0a409707691c4e3391","doi":"10.1080/17460441.2022.2050693","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17460441.2022.2050693","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Antimicrobial peptides: A plausible approach for COVID-19 treatment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which emerged as a major public health threat, has affected >400 million people globally leading to >5 million mortalities to date. Treatments of COVID-19 are still to be developed as the available therapeutic approaches are not able to combat the virus causing the disease (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2; SARS-CoV-2) satisfactorily. However, antiviral peptides (AVPs) have demonstrated prophylactic and therapeutic effects against many coronaviruses (CoVs).\nAreas covered: This review critically discusses various types of AVPs evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 along with their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, the peptides inhibiting the entry of the virus by targeting its binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or integrins, fusion mechanism as well as activation of proteolytic enzymes (cathepsin L, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), or furin) are also discussed.\nExpert opinion: Although extensively investigated, successful treatment of COVID-19 is still a challenge due to emergence of virus mutants. Antiviral peptides are anticipated to be blockbuster drugs for the management of this serious infection because of their formulation and therapeutic advantages. Although they may act on different pathways, AVPs having a multi-targeted approach are considered to have the upper hand in the management of this infection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"473-487","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646c8a0a409707691c4e3393","646c8a0a409707691c4e3394","646c8a0a409707691c4e3395","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","646c8a0a409707691c4e3396","646c8a0a409707691c4e3397"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c73","mniswId":"6435","title":"Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery","doi":"10.1517/17460441","issn":"1746-0441","eissn":"1746-045X","websiteLink":"http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/iedc20","documentHash":"a05140ca-cb80-4d3f-bcc4-01af7c727c01"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646c8a0a409707691c4e3392","year":"2022","volume":"17","number":"5","documentHash":"094e1e67-f528-4c7e-9e5a-9521813eaa0e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2","antivirals","coronavirus","peptides"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747347496259"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3ddc40970762633a5a14","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Rozempolska-Rucińska","documentHash":"b9b68a06-2cb9-4006-8ad9-1d2b9b95ba3a"},{"objectId":"662a3ddc40970762633a5a11","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Zybala","documentHash":"95c9c158-7a6c-4abc-8a81-14a5a1abf563"},{"objectId":"662a3ddc40970762633a5a0f","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Woszczyło","documentHash":"e4399689-436e-418b-96f7-531e6964b672"},{"objectId":"662a3ddc40970762633a5a0e","name":"Agata","lastName":"Kokocińska","documentHash":"29c37113-c77c-4f93-907f-225181a1e5b9"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c02b2","name":"Silvestre","lastName":"Sampino","uuid":"EFD732A653FA6294DA27B1679EE8971F5DFF015918A3CD6C3748B7C230F52D5EAAF122B8D35EB8E4A5EE0B77FDD6334EB6146BF25D08575B7F634E49FAD8BDB3","orcidId":"0000-0001-8266-5062","documentHash":"6ce0ae10-7f1d-44b5-a9ba-f2e065516e42"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1bd0","name":"ANNA","lastName":"SZCZUKA","uuid":"C7FD163CD349AAE2C0737C68EE06F1FCB2329DA95032768FADB7F0A68F3DD97D0035F395E9752229EF903301FBF7C246805CB8ACF25D42974653CC9C6C9A3E2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-9788-3764","documentHash":"b0ee4e39-2943-4ea2-bd3a-089f58790a03"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a1488","name":"JULITA","lastName":"KORCZYŃSKA","uuid":"AE2B5B174ABFB2B49DF9A94A45722AF009D9E88CEA32A0881E8C3823DD173D295152F250AA98EAE3516746191986356790A9B3CA9088459C16C415AD9226FF41","orcidId":"0000-0002-9578-8798","documentHash":"dc356037-bd85-4144-ad8c-db81d14dca4a"},{"objectId":"5e709236878c28a047391c2a","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dzięcioł","uuid":"BD1DC0104A928D8CE2BE73CA65407CE3F8B253356593219928336DF37FB1061DAD8E62407232B7D1475C8B1B9259A53BE8A6537AB2530E9B48999F8B7019B885","orcidId":"0000-0002-5063-4306","documentHash":"9b068c8a-f0b0-4b8c-b1f8-ef3263a50f3f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62d7b2424097075e7c002a81","doi":"10.3390/ani12121488","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/12/1488/pdf?version=1655193344","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Canine Smell Preferences—Do Dogs Have Their Favorite Scents?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The available evidence on dogs’ scent preferences is quite limited. The purpose of this study was to verify the canine response to selected odors that may also be preferred by humans. The experiment was performed using 14 adult dogs (10 female and 4 male) of different breeds, body size, and age (1–14 years). During the experiment, dogs were exposed to 33 odor samples: a neutral sample containing pure dipropylene glycol (control) and 32 samples containing dipropylene glycol and fragrance oils. The dog was brought to the experimental area by its handler, who then stopped at the entrance, unleashed the dog, and remained in the starting position. The dog freely explored the area for 30 s. All dog movements and behavior were recorded and analyzed. The methodology of observing the dogs freely exploring the experimental area allowed us to determine the smells that were the most attractive to them (food, beaver clothing). Our study shows that dogs interacted more frequently with the scents of blueberries, blackberries, mint, rose, lavender, and linalol."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709236878c28a047391c2a","662a3ddc40970762633a5a0f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

Therefore, in HF patients, supplementation of iron is recommended. However, iron treatment may cause adverse effects by increasing iron-related apoptosis and the production of oxygen radicals, which may cause additional heart damage. Furthermore, many knowledge gaps exist regarding the complex interplay between iron deficiency and heart failure. Here, we describe the current, comprehensive knowledge about the role of the proteins involved in iron metabolism. We will focus on the molecular and clinical aspects of iron deficiency in HF.

CA, is the most ubiquitous compound among the phenolic acid group, is also present in tea and green coffee extracts. Its consumption reduces the risk of numerous diseases as validated by preclinical and clinical studies. CA possesses a wide range of pharmacological properties, such as hepatoprotective, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, and anticancer activities. It has been extensively used in the food, chemical, medicine, and health care industries. Available reports revealed that CA can exert anticancer activity by inhibiting the cell cycle, triggering apoptosis, and suppressing the proliferation of cancer cells. It upregulates the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells 2 (NFATC2) and NFATC3 genes involved in immune pathway and downregulates B cell-specific moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 protein and SRY-box transcription factor 2 gene expression to facilitate tumor cell destruction. It promotes intracellular DNA impairment and topoisomerase I- and topoisomerase-II-DNA complex formation that perform a key function in apoptosis. In addition, CA has been documented to be an effective natural anticancer drug and was approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. Several previously published reports have provided fragmented summary of various anticancer activities of CA. Therefore, this review aims to deliver up-to-date and comprehensive assessment about the natural sources of CA, its bioavailability, metabolism, and anticancer property with an emphasis on the molecular mechanisms associated with several signaling pathways in tumor

reduced surgery time, limited blood loss, easier tissue handling, and fewer postoperative complications. The safety and biocompatibility of surgical sealants are of paramount importance therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the biocompatibility of NE'X Glue Surgical Adhesive. Chemical characterization (VOC and elements), cytotoxicity (MEM elution), genotoxicity (AMES and MLA), endotoxin contamination, sensitization potential, intracutaneous reactivity, acute and subchronic systemic toxicity with implantation as well as pyrogenicity were evaluated to investigate the biocompatibility of the NE'X Glue Surgical Adhesive. Studies were conducted according to ISO 10993 standards. The biocompatibility requirements with accordance to ISO 10993-1 for NE'X Glue were met. In vitro studies showed that NE'X Glue surgical adhesive is non-cytotoxic and non-mutagenic. Also, in vivo studies demonstrated that NE'X Glue shows no signs of toxicity, has no pyrogenic potential, and is non-sensitizing and non-irritating. The chemical characterization showed that no compounds were identified above Analytical Evaluation Threshold (AET), and no elements with concentrations higher than element-specific PDE (µg/day) were detected. NE'X Glue Surgical Adhesive is a versatile and promising new surgical sealant with a wide range of potential applications and very good*0* biocompatibility."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646ca978409707691c512afe","646ca978409707691c512aff","646ca978409707691c512b00","646ca978409707691c512b01","646ca978409707691c512b02","646ca978409707691c512b03","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"10.1038/srep","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"http://www.nature.com/srep/index.html","documentHash":"e1ebe5e8-2f08-4d23-8dee-1c3570a46188"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6204e9a22467f04219d00aa3","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"1","documentHash":"6f277079-92a2-4906-a3fd-56acdd571480"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Albumins","Aldehydes","Humans","Injections","Postoperative Complications","Tissue Adhesives","pharmacology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747347496417"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63da61884097076b4a8de107","name":"Franciszek","lastName":"Brzóska","documentHash":"dbd7e632-60a7-4a4f-88aa-f415a58c254d"},{"objectId":"63da61884097076b4a8de106","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Krajewska","documentHash":"a08f9e97-3742-48c4-8cd2-7ed6e5191995"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc065","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Białek","uuid":"A12BED83F8856FC59408B83A3FFC3005CD00227E8B9E3CDD63E0018D69DF5C7B8C1F2654E374EDDF66FD5134B0EC82E6F1373ACB34865E1080732212F8D5A107","orcidId":"0000-0002-2003-8642","documentHash":"1acfc7d8-96a4-4f5a-ba27-a323a432cc3b"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b8752","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Śliwiński","uuid":"69A0838243329A2E67F277EC38BDE415BD5E7E0BC26992ED74467ADC20FDDCA2AFA0A7754742746EE5B2427F4E6B615CA257D66FC9969F495AA2645D99580288","orcidId":"0000-0003-0499-2513","documentHash":"8cc5e0a8-9552-4f1b-a8f7-c6b6cff210c9"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a5494","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"BIAŁEK","uuid":"0796556D3F097E043B0890A584AC21D9008E194C5308FB5D59B3A7D6F9F91BA9FB5B6C7DF8B24541EE7EEDE6DDFC1CE31324739305794793716ED945246521AE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7879-300X","documentHash":"b0d8e54b-02a7-4eb2-ac67-a4f9ce3439f8"},{"objectId":"5e709289878c28a047397801","name":"Marian","lastName":"Czauderna","uuid":"9D759197F4CC8A63445ECE6DCCDC399FA537A7395F579BEAB0787EB80D95EAA8F2110DA2F38C236E8F8579C85421EEDCD76607A67D50AB6379469AC70459224A","orcidId":"0000-0001-7475-5340","documentHash":"a7415d59-1347-4407-8fad-c16256989076"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-10-30","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6215e7342467f04ac0d9c5a0","doi":"10.1016/j.livsci.2021.104799","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871141321004078","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Different chemical forms of dietary selenium influence the fatty acid profile and the malondialdehyde content of selected edible organs in broiler chickens","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The main goal of the study was to determine the influence of the addition for 6 weeks of 0.25 ppm Se as selenate (SeVI) or selenised yeast (SeY) to an isoenergetic and isoproteinous basal diet containing 2% fish oil, 2% sunflower oil and 12 ppm lycopene on the concentrations of fatty acids (FA), especially mono- (MUFA) and poly-unsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids in the liver, spleen and patch of broiler chickens. The effects of these supplements on the yield of PUFA peroxidation in these internal organs of the chickens were also investigated. SeVI or SeY added to the diet decreased the total concentration of saturated FA (SFA), especially atherogenic- (A-SFA) and thrombogenic (T-SFA) SFA in the liver compared to the control group. The diet with SeVI reduced the concentration sum of MUFA, the yield of PUFA peroxidation and the capacity of ?9-desaturation of C16:0 and C18:0 in the liver of chickens compared to the control and SeY diets. The yield of PUFA peroxidation was higher in the liver and patch of chickens fed the diet with SeY than in the control and SeVI diet. SeVI or SeY added to the diet decreased the PUFAn-6 to PUFAn-3 ratio in the liver, spleen and patch of chickens. The diets with SeVI and SeY usually revealed a negligible influence on the content sum of A-SFA, T-SFA, SFA, MUFA and PUFA in the spleen and patch of chickens compared to the control diet.

In the present study, the influence of the deletion on transcript levels of MSYq genes (Ssty1, Ssty2, Sly, Srsy, Asty, Orly) and homologous to them X-linked genes (Sstx, Slx, Slxl1, Srsx) was assessed. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that in testes of B10.BR-Ydel males activity of Ssty1 is unchanged, but transcription from all other MSYq genes is highly reduced and reaches from 59 % to only 5 % of the control levels. The decrease in expression of MSYq genes is accompanied by the two-fold increase in expression of Slx and Slxl1 genes. This is the first functional characterization of the deletion in B10.BR-Ydel strain. Another aim of the study was to reveal the mechanism through which deleted Y chromosome of B10.BR-Ydel males could alter phenotype of their female progeny, what was documented in our previous works. Epigenetic inheritance hypothesis was tested by microarray analysis of DNA methylation in B10.BR-Ydel and control B10.BR sperm. The assessment revealed moderate differences and allowed concluding that the mutated Y chromosome can influence traits of females from the next generation partially through altering sperm DNA methylation, but probably some additional mechanisms are engaged here. Breeding data indicate that feminization of pre- and neonatal environment in which next generation females develop is one of such additional mechanisms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3d5c","5e7093d5878c28a0473b19a1","5e709312878c28a0473a24cd"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b0878c28a04739abad"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"2","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64cd3f054097077ac1df8aad","64cd3f054097077ac1df8aaf","64cd3f054097077ac1df8ab0","5e709312878c28a0473a24cd","5e709328878c28a0473a3d5c","5e7093d5878c28a0473b19a1","5e7092b0878c28a04739abad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479508","mniswId":"17197","title":"Reproductive Biology","issn":"1642-431X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"fc62aa62-e33b-4e1f-846b-c39a12bf1c46"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["transgenerational effects","sperm DNA methylation","spermiogenesis genes","X-Y conflict","Y chromosome long arm"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433575701"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3de740970762633a5a9a","name":"Wanda","lastName":"Olech","documentHash":"7543fb06-c556-445c-9af5-616f1aaf01a8"},{"objectId":"662a3de740970762633a5a99","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Gręda","documentHash":"643e333f-e9c2-403e-9a95-4134b0bcc3d8"},{"objectId":"662a3de740970762633a5a98","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Bielecki","documentHash":"31c65b52-8e37-4654-817c-536151201652"},{"objectId":"662a3de740970762633a5a96","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Wojdan","documentHash":"be7b4d10-37b9-451d-b21a-666b9a4466e3"},{"objectId":"662a3de740970762633a5a95","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Baraniewicz-Kołek","documentHash":"b0c29c0d-cbb5-4362-b948-da294880f1fe"},{"objectId":"662a3de740970762633a5a94","name":"Anna Maria","lastName":"Duszewska","documentHash":"518737c0-c3cc-4a93-85fc-4f6e99b24da0"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a5c","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Barłowska","uuid":"61307D215C740FA8D62B99FEFD1E82A1D86645AB8E6BC78F63A5252C8F2952C758C3E86466F1D9A4222D78B9FEBD61E119FEB0B0F8BB1841AA8664FC278FF6DE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6186-8730","documentHash":"5773d85b-0d07-4bf3-9244-9f36be99bd30"},{"objectId":"5e709236878c28a047391bac","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Niżański","uuid":"97F0DD63A6372913B43AC87F04E2E499D30C5440D494533BF3C45495DDB5FDE76E6376D5C05AD2F2FD6EF36ABC77E1B325B21C7D8638E9AF9B007D9CF3174EBB","orcidId":"0000-0003-1056-0784","documentHash":"f9b28beb-caf8-4ded-a228-55b8ec682ed1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62a170014097070cd36e5d70","doi":"10.3390/ani12101239","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/10/1239/pdf?version=1652274326","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Establishment of a Wisent (Bison bonasus) Germplasm Bank","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The wisent, or European bison (Bison bonasus), belongs to the same family (Bovidae) as the American bison and domestic cattle. The wisent is the largest mammal in Europe, and is called the “Forest Emperor”. The wisent is listed as “Vulnerable” on the IUCN Red List, and is protected by international law. Achievements in reproductive biotechnology have opened new possibilities for the cryoconservation of the wisent germplasm. Therefore, this research aimed to improve a strategy for the protection and preservation of the European bison through the creation of a wisent germplasm bank, based on the following procedures: isolation and in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes, in vitro fertilization (IVF) of matured oocytes, in vitro embryo culture (IVC), and embryo cryopreservation. Wisent ovaries were isolated from females outside the reproductive season, and eliminated from breeding for reasons other than infertility. Cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs) were isolated from follicles greater than 2 mm in diameter and matured for 24 h and 30 h. After IVM, COCs were fertilized in vitro with wisent sperm. The obtained wisent zygotes, based on oocytes matured for 24 h and 30 h, were cultured for 216 h. Embryos at the morula and early blastocyst stages were vitrified and then warmed and transferred to interspecies recipients (Bos taurus). USG and biochemical tests were used to monitor pregnancies. This study obtained embryos in the morula and early blastocyst stages only after oocytes were fertilized and matured for 30 h. On average, per oocyte donor, 12.33 ± 0.5 COCs were isolated, and only 9.33 ± 0.61 COCs were qualified for in vitro maturation (75.68%), while 9.16 ± 0.48 COCs were matured (84.32%). On average, per donor, 5.5 ± 0.34 embryos were cleaved (59.96%) after 48 h post-fertilization (hpf), and 3.33 ± 0.21 achieved the eight-cell stage (36.52%) after 96 hpf, while 1 ± 0.21 morula and early blastocyst stages (10.71%) were achieved after 216 hpf. A total of six embryos (one morula and five early blastocysts) were obtained and vitrified; after warming, five of them were interspecies transferred to cattle (Bos taurus). On day 41 after fertilization, 3 out of 5 pregnancies were detected based on USG, P4, and PAG tests. However, no pregnancy was observed on day 86 after fertilization, indicating embryo resorption. This study shows that obtaining wisent embryos in vitro, and subsequent cryopreservation to create a wisent embryo bank, can be applied and implemented for the wisent protection program."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709236878c28a047391bac"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a5c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709236878c28a047391bac","662a3de740970762633a5a94","662a3de740970762633a5a95","662a3de740970762633a5a96","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a5c","662a3de740970762633a5a98","662a3de740970762633a5a99","662a3de740970762633a5a9a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","eissn":"2076-2615","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"cf012089-3ed8-4dde-a05c-d5b280240cb4"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["wisent","European bison","oocytes","sperm","embryos","embryo transfer","germplasm bank","threatened species"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433576413"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658205824097076c14b7ef2b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Dziuda","documentHash":"576de830-ca26-43b4-808d-07e8497e6bd9"},{"objectId":"658205824097076c14b7ef2a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kowalczuk","documentHash":"1f17c885-16c1-40a4-a308-80761e0878aa"},{"objectId":"658205824097076c14b7ef29","name":"Agata","lastName":"Pabin","documentHash":"ac2b94f4-e8b1-4596-89b5-fa72e26e3e48"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a5fa8","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Maculewicz","uuid":"A16E25B84D56979731364ABF505DACDF21EFA4C88BD2D2507ABA1F9D741E597B4E03995F22CCF98A0354454D17C6F9E8C32A373C7AA5B08177020F11888D9787","orcidId":"0000-0002-3122-3085","documentHash":"b6b49af3-9a33-4330-b050-06cf9a76dd40"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a5494","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"BIAŁEK","uuid":"0796556D3F097E043B0890A584AC21D9008E194C5308FB5D59B3A7D6F9F91BA9FB5B6C7DF8B24541EE7EEDE6DDFC1CE31324739305794793716ED945246521AE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7879-300X","documentHash":"b0d8e54b-02a7-4eb2-ac67-a4f9ce3439f8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aca03240970772e83232e0","doi":"10.3390/jcm11154314","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/15/4314/htm","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Endogenous Risk Factors of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) in Military Professionals with a Special Emphasis on Military Pilots","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors can be categorized as non-modifiable and modifiable. Modifiable risk factors include some exogenous and behavioral factors that can be easily modified, whereas endogenous modifiable risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or obesity may be modified to a limited extend. An increased prevalence of CVDs as well as their risk factors have been observed in military personnel, as specific military-related stressors are highly correlated with acute cardiac disorders. Military pilots are a subpopulation with great CVD risk due to an accumulation of different psychological and physical stressors also considered to be CVD risk factors. This review presents data concerning CVD risk in military professionals, with a special emphasis on military pilots and crew members. We also discuss the usefulness of novel indicators related to oxidative stress, inflammation, or hormonal status as well as genetic factors as markers of CVD risk. For a correct and early estimation of CVD risk in asymptomatic soldiers, especially if no environmental risk factors coexist, the scope of performed tests should be increased with novel biomarkers. An indication of risk group among military professional, especially military pilots, enables the implementation the early preventive activities, which will prolong their state of health and military suitability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933a878c28a0473a5494"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709344878c28a0473a5fa8","658205824097076c14b7ef29","658205824097076c14b7ef2a","658205824097076c14b7ef2b","5e70933a878c28a0473a5494"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["atherosclerosis","crew members","diabetes","hyperlipidemia","hypertension","military pilots","obesity","oxidative stress","SNPs","soldiers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433576798"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646c8fa2409707691c4e6556","name":"Harald","lastName":"Willschke","documentHash":"aa579f58-e6c2-47b6-8f51-cf930da3e606"},{"objectId":"646c8fa2409707691c4e6555","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kletecka-Pulker","documentHash":"df547b0e-480a-4f3c-863e-4a9eecccddff"},{"objectId":"646c8fa2409707691c4e6554","name":"Oliver","lastName":"Kimberger","documentHash":"0b670840-bac7-4c73-b2e0-0690aeb929a1"},{"objectId":"646c8fa2409707691c4e6553","name":"Nikolay T.","lastName":"Tzvetkov","documentHash":"b4c636d9-a143-4a42-af5c-026f74aca152"},{"objectId":"646c8fa2409707691c4e6552","name":"Elisabeth","lastName":"Klager","documentHash":"dfef0425-75ea-4e65-87c4-e6a435027b53"},{"objectId":"646c8fa2409707691c4e6551","name":"Olena","lastName":"Litvinova","documentHash":"da81fa63-3f60-4999-884b-4121528c0c4c"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646c8fa2409707691c4e6550","doi":"10.3390/ph15081025","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/15/8/1025/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Digital Pills with Ingestible Sensors: Patent Landscape Analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The modern healthcare system is directly related to the development of digital health tools and solutions.

They are considered a biological clock, as they shorten in parallel with aging. Furthermore, short telomeres are associated with several age-related diseases. However, the variability in telomere shortening independent of chronological age suggests that it is a modifiable factor. In fact, it is regulated inter alia by genetic damage, cell division, aging, oxidative stress, and inflammation. A key question remains: how can we prevent accelerated telomere attrition and subsequent premature replicative senescence? A number of studies have explored the possible impact of omega-3 fatty acids on telomere shortening. This review summarizes published cross-sectional studies, randomized controlled trials, and rodent studies investigating the role of omega-3 fatty acids in telomere biology. It also covers a broad overview of the mechanism, currently favored in the field, that explains the impact of omega-3 fatty acids on telomeres-the food compound's ability to modulate oxidative stress and inflammation. Although the results of the studies performed to date are not consistent, the vast majority indicate a beneficial effect of omega-3 fatty acids on telomere length."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709442878c28a0473b91a0","5e7092ae878c28a04739a775","5e7092a8878c28a04739a089"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"3723","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709442878c28a0473b91a0","5e7092a8878c28a04739a089","5e7092ae878c28a04739a775"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","issn":"2072-6643","eissn":"2072-6643","documentHash":"66793415-2acd-4481-8264-119c658e1575"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"631f06d14097075c0bb7dc10","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"18","documentHash":"93eed4e8-1c7d-4109-950b-6cb231483b50"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["omega-3 fatty acid","oxidative stress","senescence","telomere"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433576809"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebed5ab752340254fc4038c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kowal","uuid":"22F87F55D1159A4018A81344FE4B5F4032F55D6E2CCC3B1B44C4C263373DC5B0663E7AF654766DABD3943ED15DCD69AAF07F1A805568AD4074AA060FD2FB19B0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4716-5040","documentHash":"55ed4a84-cc8d-4b18-9e6f-f18eabb8a667"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afeab","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Pierzchała","uuid":"B6A2D7789E13D203E2E915FF5425734EB014579E76ABB30A43AF618C47FD4A17C42DCE475CA59B2BA967596814D2CB409F900B85069A4FC95E78D7E6A0ED42A7","orcidId":"0000-0001-7001-1336","documentHash":"2da70898-1086-4509-a2be-569bad515bcc"},{"objectId":"5e7092cb878c28a04739cba8","name":"Angelika","lastName":"Tkaczyk-Wlizło","uuid":"1BA7C66353C6D8384F289228FC9D888DAFCC4D06808C6F770C997DF56873F0BA5F9CC7309A19AF7BD9B024B9D7FAE1C726E4C797DE4B51AAD0DED6F1CCCB628C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2261-6909","documentHash":"c8306bfd-4576-4ca3-a9ee-f44b91d7d407"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390a1a","name":"Brygida","lastName":"Ślaska","uuid":"DA5394636CA3B0B9FB00DE7E0520C0534141E3515EBAC12FE4F60E8B0A54D3A9FDF69BA9DFFC6A7D84B771596C702B103F0023C5EE1EDB07D6D22A1839700311","orcidId":"0000-0003-3933-2400","documentHash":"193a19f6-5922-45fa-a008-9833cab54d6d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62ea33fb4097075e7c33a4ec","doi":"10.2478/aoas-2022-0009","publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/aoas-2022-0009","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Evaluation of the tRNA-Leu (UUR) gene haplotype profile observed in canine mammary gland tumours based on comparative analysis with the MT-TL1 human gene","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"the aetiology and pathogenesis of many canine tumours are likely to be similar to cancers found in humans. this study aimed to evaluate a plausible link between changes in the tRNA-Leu (uuR) gene and the carcinogenesis process in dogs with mammary gland tumours. the whole mitochondrial dna (mtdna) isolated from blood and tumour tissues of 13 dogs with malignant mammary gland tumours was sequenced.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no bibliometric report to date has been published that analyzes this important literature set to reveal prevailing topics and trends and their impacts reflected in citation counts.\n\nObjective: We used a bibliometric approach to unveil and evaluate the scientific literature on digital teaching research in medical education, demonstrating recurring research topics, productive authors, research organizations, countries, and journals. We further aimed to discuss some of the topics and findings reported by specific highly cited works.\n\nMethods: The Web of Science electronic database was searched to identify relevant papers on digital teaching research in medical education. Basic bibliographic data were obtained by the \"Analyze\" and \"Create Citation Report\" functions of the database. Complete bibliographic data were exported to VOSviewer for further analyses. Visualization maps were generated to display the recurring author keywords and terms mentioned in the titles and abstracts of the publications.\n\nResults: The analysis was based on data from 3978 papers that were identified. The literature received worldwide contributions with the most productive countries being the United States and United Kingdom. Reviews were significantly more cited, but the citations between open access vs non-open access papers did not significantly differ. Some themes were cited more often, reflected by terms such as virtual reality, innovation, trial, effectiveness, and anatomy. Different aspects in medical education were experimented for digital teaching, such as gross anatomy education, histology, complementary medicine, medicinal chemistry, and basic life support. Some studies have shown that digital teaching could increase learning satisfaction, knowledge gain, and even cost-effectiveness. More studies were conducted on trainees than on undergraduate students.\n\nConclusions: Digital teaching in medical education is expected to flourish in the future, especially during this era of COVID-19 pandemic."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"e32747","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646ddc6f40970770404a4589","646ddc6f40970770404a458a","646ddc6f40970770404a458b","646ddc6f40970770404a458c","646ddc6f40970770404a458d","646ddc6f40970770404a458e","646ddc6f40970770404a458f","646ddc6f40970770404a4590","646ddc6f40970770404a4591","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","646ddc6f40970770404a4592"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850cc55","mniswId":"29677","title":"JMIR Medical Education","eissn":"2369-3762","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"97d524bb-f240-42bf-b279-f14b8e4f9299"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646ddc6f40970770404a4588","year":"2022","volume":"8","number":"1","documentHash":"311c4b04-5c5f-4a8e-a7a7-f685dd05a296"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["anatomy","augmented reality","basic life support","bibliometric","citation","digital teaching","life support","literature","medical education","medicine","online learning","satisfaction","trend","virtual reality"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433576847"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf1d1","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Gralak","uuid":"2C895A950CFE08CA20A86EF46A6C222664FC7420D4E98DF05F7D2209C106CFEA64EC2F8EB201CA8D2513DD3683D44C188AAD6C20055B410216EA9B9D8F56BEED","orcidId":"0000-0003-1902-4945","documentHash":"cbf60061-ec7d-4f29-bd2b-17a3921dd550"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bba","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Naczk","uuid":"6C1D3152D11773FD1052BB06BAE3CF9F573842625F4DB9FF2FE57F11285F23D7C660EEE1AE51D5B56EB46E10283DAB26B5784C3D88CE02F4D52ACD7809B91800","orcidId":"0000-0001-7731-4487","documentHash":"d6ff6a00-5e55-49bf-8355-72fc085e34ca"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ad7f","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Głażewska","uuid":"CAC59F4BDA2E19198D4AAC7B00518363F6F668013DE68B9410958ABC70F0707B0907C4EDBFD6AABA90116F07E17B7F6DF92BA9DFC51A0E2D10306F6666DFE72F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0107-7742","documentHash":"38b8be4d-a819-4076-908b-11c7038e26e3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"646cc26d409707691c537fc0","doi":"10.2478/aoas-2022-0033","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Differences and changes: an evaluation of the genetic diversity of Arabian mares from Polish state studs born between 1996 and 2013","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The goal of our study was to estimate genetic diversity of Arabian horses from Polish state studs which could have changed due to the extensive use of foreign sires in Polish breeding after 1989. The analysis focused on 1,388 Arabian mares born from 1996 to 2013 in the Białka, Janów Podlaski and Michałów studs. Basic parameters of pedigree, mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite analyses were considered in the study. In the pedigree analysis, changes in the gene pool over the years were noted through the considerable increase of contribution of new founders’ genes and the considerable decrease of inbreeding level. The microsatellite analysis confirmed progressive changes in the gene pool but, contrary to expectations, only three new microsatellite alleles were detected, and a decreased level of heterozygosity was observed. In turn, mtDNA analysis showed a stable genetic situation in the studs throughout the period analysed. The results of the analyses present a diverse picture of the population, which is clearly divided into the three subpopulations of Białka, Janów Podlaski and Michałów, although the pictures presented differed depending on the analytical methods used. Genetic differences among the studs should be considered a positive feature of the Polish population. In order to preserve the present level of population genetic diversity, changes in breeding policy are needed that aim to stop the loss of genes of the historical ancestors of Polish Arabian horses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bba","5e7092b1878c28a04739ad7f"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709489878c28a0473bf1d1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1225-1233","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ad7f","5e709411878c28a0473b5bba","5e709489878c28a0473bf1d1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547705d","mniswId":"1208","title":"Annals of Animal Science","issn":"1642-3402","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e9d5cce1-c361-423f-b07d-f938aa6a284b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["genetic diversity","mtDNA","pedigree analysis","microsatellite","Arabian horse"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433576862"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67e146bbfdbe831b59821a74","name":"J.","lastName":"Paszkiewicz","documentHash":"91a0e636-ac95-422c-a0f5-447b01e5e779"},{"objectId":"67e146bbfdbe831b59821a73","name":"O.","lastName":"Ak","documentHash":"1424e72f-f36a-4e7b-9161-acea17f3267b"},{"objectId":"612d94299543c7051ff01b28","name":"Michel ","lastName":"Mickael","uuid":"6C0F190719C006F28401303260F31EB975571B3A00976F324446353810A0BEBD070D7D62CAB7367E88BFD3385375A74E21C88497F33459BA7C60F5AA5C3267FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-4186-4900","documentHash":"93399ad0-db2d-4c58-b04e-476d4131aaa8"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2bce","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"CF88F9E6AE6F6D4688EFFE7E353C506F0FC2CCFDDC5A25F1E27728F4BBC1A65A2D3C8BBEC398E42DE41F78A277DF11B575D1F6E04A389CFAD5118469EFCBDA87","orcidId":"0000-0001-7451-7887","documentHash":"8ad3afc2-78d5-478b-8e2b-c8672e7a0255"},{"objectId":"5e7093db878c28a0473b1fea","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Kulik","uuid":"96E7E7F520A06151CAFE11FC7328FD1012BF9DB32B5400D6F8688588116D4EDEFD6EEC03CC75D6A0C573DE59B2949ABEFE6084DC753AC3521FFA8C21EFCBB5AF","orcidId":"0000-0001-8229-4097","documentHash":"98299cd9-d1ae-4bff-bbe5-f7ab7947b9b0"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Sacharczuk","uuid":"8E2CFC97D0176907FD3FDCC1CB83621D26B1BE05F486A6134D990E8B18DF3BF8E8F3AADDCDC1D73F10233B59A74445730E291963FD429C8698BFDF373BA38AEF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6309-5292","documentHash":"fc3da1d3-82af-4442-a191-158025188e29"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399193","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Horbańczuk","uuid":"976205AE9A3DD4FA85531EB44854AE0083FBAD6743C6797D800A9669BD6FAED38693031A6C16E0A03AAE6903DEB2CEF4B47FFF137CB5399DCB5BFBCFCFF25343","orcidId":"0000-0002-7561-0941","documentHash":"a9235661-fb2e-4102-b6a6-35060d6414c3"},{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a047396795","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Łazarczyk","uuid":"369328E12328DEE0206F2C624EE21B973B0B2800A60CD812B75FDB990144F34BFAE348EE320986F32944D1A1C08BDB0AAE62D1B956217A77A0F0B74452C172B4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1938-8143","documentHash":"c64c3c59-9c7d-4953-b6cb-4fa4cbd2a832"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"638de37c4097076e0f7112f3","doi":"10.3390/molecules27196453","publicUri":"http://www.mdpi.com/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Adera2.0: A Drug Repurposing Workflow for Neuroimmunological Investigations Using Neural Networks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Drug repurposing in the context of neuroimmunological (NI) investigations is still in its primary stages. Drug repurposing is an important method that bypasses lengthy drug discovery procedures and focuses on discovering new usages for known medications. Neuroimmunological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, and depression, include various pathologies that result from the interaction between the central nervous system and the immune system. However, the repurposing of NI medications is hindered by the vast amount of information that needs mining. We previously presented Adera1.0, which was capable of text mining PubMed for answering query-based questions. However, Adera1.0 was not able to automatically identify chemical compounds within relevant sentences. To challenge the need for repurposing known medications for neuroimmunological diseases, we built a deep neural network named Adera2.0 to perform drug repurposing. The workflow uses three deep learning networks. The first network is an encoder and its main task is to embed text into matrices. The second network uses a mean squared error (MSE) loss function to predict answers in the form of embedded matrices. The third network, which constitutes the main novelty in our updated workflow, also uses a MSE loss function. Its main usage is to extract compound names from relevant sentences resulting from the previous network. To optimize the network function, we compared eight different designs. We found that a deep neural network consisting of an RNN neural network and a leaky ReLU could achieve 0.0001 loss and 67% sensitivity. Additionally, we validated Adera2.0’s ability to predict NI drug usage against the DRUG Repurposing Hub database. These results establish the ability of Adera2.0 to repurpose drug candidates that can shorten the development of the drug cycle. The workflow could be download online."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e70927a878c28a047396795"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e7093db878c28a0473b1fea","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2bce","67e146bbfdbe831b59821a73","67e146bbfdbe831b59821a74","612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e70927a878c28a047396795"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["drug repurposing","neuro-immunology","deep neural network"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433576864"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"640731f440970770355d41a9","name":"Ton","lastName":"Baars","documentHash":"b594965d-17cc-4d2d-b7c2-5c05cf57a0da"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a647a","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szwaczkowski","uuid":"56391EE9B1484B850AA90C92545CB684BE992CAD1C4D316FA3C84D19A6DC7C1082797B31A2F7BFC8577935BA945057467214C9F129C0FBC518F8F82141B4BFCF","orcidId":"0000-0003-4233-8803","documentHash":"6e497679-4692-45e8-bab5-e66bc4e45f89"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6476","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Tomaszyk","uuid":"FC637D6FC0F86F920D228DEB5A06E7571CD471C240D616DC40BEB499C7238C7FDD20621BB44B340DA9DCFDFC6420A4DC37DA5CBACA67DEB05AC97C4FAB031B18","orcidId":"0000-0001-6297-1580","documentHash":"a338f324-d1e9-4b0d-9ce3-54266d30090f"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6398","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Mueller","uuid":"D96A7A22583D8BED781A5FFB097423EB38FB60A0298AA98EC5DC01B7A78E80404CB10AB58A73D9240E7C3E8D4A5D98FF4CBBD78EBCC6F5E67B9534CB3A7E918B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3038-5805","documentHash":"4dd642bb-07b2-4d3a-a349-3b1b78e8d011"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62f8","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Koszela","uuid":"CC158A173EAACF611F05F15CDA1A7EBFE73E3B6F7233F465ABF4F7D20D93BA28EBE7C1A4EA66F305AEA7A2B3761C68326E65847A3C01FB2776BDA8877F89A351","orcidId":"0000-0002-8244-2763","documentHash":"3abeccb2-c35c-40f8-a41c-add526a8654b"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bbad","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Grodkowski","uuid":"72FBB18F86C85BE1CBEAD356FAF8043E8D36F7FC5B5A8B558556B3F60582FFE6C76E3894D90A46AA91518934931833FC1FBC658BD97C3872EB51FCD22CF13954","orcidId":"0000-0001-5715-6514","documentHash":"64f577bd-f1f2-4d18-8a69-b2b2dd67aa62"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Sakowski","uuid":"C87300CD8C2E2C660E7BA7643D2648CA6260BCA2F36C89DE3CE9CA734753DCBC23AA717DC64FD468245A05CBE16B5C43FBA0570AE5ECA8CFC6CBF48252E899D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-2264-4638","documentHash":"cfaaf5aa-3854-4022-a3c5-b8e2e8624a3e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63adc5654097070d11c35e25","doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-25275-2","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25275-2","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Early detection of mastitis in cows using the system based on 3D motions detectors","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mastitis is one of the major health problems in dairy herds leading to a reduction in the leading to a reduction in the quality of milk and economic losses. The research aimed to present the system, which uses electronic 3D motion detectors to detect the early symptoms of mastitis. The system would allow more effective prevention of this illness. The experiment was carried out on 118 cows (64 Holstein Friesian and 54 Brown Swiss). The animals were kept in free-stall barn with access to pasture. The occurrence of mastitis cases was noticed in veterinary register. Microbiological culture was taken from milk in order to confirm the development of infection. Data from motion detectors were defined as time spent by animals on feed intake, ruminating, physical activity and rest, and were expanded by adding information about feeding group, breed type and lactation number. During analyses, two approaches were used to process the same dataset: artificial neural networks (ANN) and logistic regression. The obtained ANN and the logistic regression models proved to be satisfactory from the perspective of applied criteria of goodness of fit (area under curve—exceed 0.8). Quality parameters (accuracy, sensitivity and specifity) of logistic regression are relatively high (larger than 0.73), whereas the ranks of significance of the studied variables varied across datasets. These proposed models can be useful for automating the detection of mastitis once integrated into the farm’s IT

apple pomace (DAP) as a feed additive on the enzymatic activity and non-enzymatic compounds belonging to the antioxidant system in cattle rumen fluid. The experiment included 4 Polish Holstein–Friesian cannulated dairy cows and lasted 52 days. The control group was fed with the standard diet, while in the experimental group, 6% of the feedstuff was replaced by dried apple pomace. After the feeding period, ruminal fluid was collected. The spectrophotometric technique for the activity of lysosomal enzymes, the content of vitamin C, polyphenols, and the potential to scavenge the free DPPH radical was used. The enzyme immunoassay tests (ELISA) were used to establish the activity of antioxidants enzymes and MDA. Among the rumen aminopeptidases, a significant reduction (p < 0.01) from 164.00 to 142.00 was observed for leucyl-aminopeptidase. The activity of glycosidases was decreased for HEX (from 231.00 to 194.00) and β-Glu (from 1294.00 to 1136.00), while a significant statistically increase was noticed for BGRD (from 31.10 to 42.40), α-Glu (from 245.00 to 327.00), and MAN (from 29.70 to 36.70). Furthermore, the activity of catalase and GSH (p < 0.01) was inhibited. In turn, the level of vitamin C (from 22.90 to 24.10) and MDA (from 0.36 to 0.45) was statistically higher (p < 0.01). The most positive correlations were observed between AlaAP and LeuAP (r = 0.897) in the aminopeptidases group and between β-Gal and MAN (r = 0.880) in the glycosidases group. Furthermore, one of the most significant correlations were perceived between SOD and AlaAP (r = 0.505) and AcP (r = 0.450). The most negative correlation was noticed between α-Gal and DPPH (r = −0.533) based on these observations. Apple pomace as a feed additive has an influence on lysosomal degradation processes and modifies oxidation–reduction potential in the rumen fluid. Polyphenols and other low-weight antioxidant compounds are sufficient to maintain redox balance in the rumen.\nKeywords: rumen fluid; dried apple pomace; enzymes; antioxidants; polyphenols; dairy

of higher plasma growth hormone levels on subclinical ketosis in postpartum Holstein cows","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ketosis is a major metabolic disorder that can lead to huge economic losses in postpartum dairy cows by influencing milk production and reproduction performance. Therefore, it is very important to understand the characteristics and significance of plasma GH levels and dynamic changes in postpartum dairy cows for finding pathogenesis of subclinical ketosis (SK). The present study aimed to determine the role of growth hormone (GH) from the onset of SK to the fifth week postpartum and to explain the variations in GH, and metabolic markers namely, β-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA), non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and glucose (GLU) at early and later SK stages in postpartum Holstein cows. A 5-wk test and an intraday 12-h test were conducted in postpartum Holstein cows. Both tests were carried out every three hours from 10:00–22:00 for 7–14 days postpartum (12-h test: n = 16) to determine plasma concentrations of GH, BHBA, NEFA and GLU. The 5-wk test results showed that GH, BHBA and NEFA concentrations were significantly higher in the SK group during the five-weeks postpartum (p &lt; 0.01); GLU concentration was significantly lower in the SK group (p &lt; 0.01). Intraday 12-h test results revealed that the feeding time affected the plasma concentrations of GH, BHBA, NEFA and GLU. After 1-h of feeding time, GH concentrations decreased, while BHBA, NEFA and GLU concentrations increased. After 4-h of feeding time GH, BHBA and NEFA had the highest plasma concentrations, and GLU the lowest. In both experiments, GH was positively correlated with BHBA, NEFA, and negatively correlated with GLU. It can be suggested that GH has a potential role in development and aetiology of subclinical ketosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afeab"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1265-1272","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["660fe96d4097076263f8b1f1","660fe96d4097076263f8b1f2","660fe96d4097076263f8b1f3","660fe96d4097076263f8b1f4","660fe96d4097076263f8b1f5","660fe96d4097076263f8b1f6","5e7093bb878c28a0473afeab","660fe96d4097076263f8b1f8","660fe96d4097076263f8b1f9","5e7092c1878c28a04739c18c","660fe96d4097076263f8b1fa","660fe96d4097076263f8b1fb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547705d","mniswId":"1208","title":"Annals of Animal Science","issn":"1642-3402","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e9d5cce1-c361-423f-b07d-f938aa6a284b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["growth hormone","ketosis","Holstein","BHBA","NEFA","GLU","dynamic changes","plasma"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433576886"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"660fe96b4097076263f8b1cc","name":"Bao Xiang","lastName":"He","documentHash":"deae11c3-bd79-4273-bce3-b7b2dfc7fb0f"},{"objectId":"660fe96b4097076263f8b1cb","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Miętkiewska","documentHash":"068337f9-a91c-455d-81e3-5a052560ebdb"},{"objectId":"660fe96b4097076263f8b1ca","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Sobiech","documentHash":"2599f71c-1901-4c75-b8c5-cb4632d06c21"},{"objectId":"660fe96b4097076263f8b1c8","name":"Sarmad","lastName":"Sohaib","documentHash":"3bb7cfe7-cf6d-4b83-832d-eee7bfd58283"},{"objectId":"660fe96b4097076263f8b1c7","name":"Muhammad Bakhsh","lastName":"Abro","documentHash":"0d86537b-da88-4791-b349-5bc37a7f4adb"},{"objectId":"660fe96b4097076263f8b1c6","name":"Yunfei","lastName":"Huang","documentHash":"ccf444b4-4e4a-4852-ba55-4ec7bbc88765"},{"objectId":"660fe96b4097076263f8b1c5","name":"Yulan","lastName":"Du","documentHash":"ff4e478c-b928-4e35-92ab-edda25619030"},{"objectId":"660fe96b4097076263f8b1c4","name":"Linli","lastName":"Gan","documentHash":"9a81636b-508a-4a14-8ffe-73b8decaccdf"},{"objectId":"660fe96b4097076263f8b1c3","name":"Peng","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"d0be51a8-6c79-4872-b582-d05f0fd89af4"},{"objectId":"660fe96b4097076263f8b1c2","name":"Rongze","lastName":"He","documentHash":"a1ed63a1-57b4-44cc-affe-e8baccca14d0"},{"objectId":"660fe96b4097076263f8b1c1","name":"Huiru","lastName":"Yu","documentHash":"4495defa-5e1b-4a17-9c78-bc4b181e97a3"},{"objectId":"660fe96b4097076263f8b1c0","name":"Muhammad Ali","lastName":"Mohsin","documentHash":"f5eec32c-a2ca-49e2-b955-d1ab16e20308"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afeab","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Pierzchała","uuid":"B6A2D7789E13D203E2E915FF5425734EB014579E76ABB30A43AF618C47FD4A17C42DCE475CA59B2BA967596814D2CB409F900B85069A4FC95E78D7E6A0ED42A7","orcidId":"0000-0001-7001-1336","documentHash":"2da70898-1086-4509-a2be-569bad515bcc"},{"objectId":"5e7092c1878c28a04739c18c","name":"Chandra","lastName":"Pareek","uuid":"6B5719D042B6FAE6A44D7746B9C2E64F813BE1F966A8AE1F0AEF25D3DF26D9E316E2A29674E19A80817941835FD23BC91C3F7ACB56DE9DEDC47B058742E83B37","documentHash":"3b7eee45-6b39-4312-82b5-4bedddb40107"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646f3155409707768b5bd2e4","doi":"10.3389/fvets.2021.796494","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2021.796494/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Differentiation of subclinical ketosis and liver function test indices in adipose tissues associated with hyperketonemia in postpartum dairy cattle","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Past studies suggested that during early lactation and the transition period, higher plasma growth hormone (GH) levels in subclinical ketosis (SCK) might involve the initiation of body adipose tissues mobilization, resulting in metabolic disorders in ruminants particularly hyperketonemia. The upregulated GH mRNA expression in adipose tissue may take part in the adipolysis process in SCK-affected cows that paves a way for study further. This study aimed to characterize the plasma levels of GH, β-hydroxybutyrate acid (BHBA) and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and glucose (GLu) in ketotic cows and healthy control (CON) cows; to measure the liver function test (LFT) indices in ketotic and healthy CON cows, and finally the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay of candidate genes expressed in adipose tissues of ketotic and healthy CON cows during 0 to 7 week postpartum. Three experiments were conducted. Experiment-1 involved 21 Holstein cows weighing 500–600 kg with 2–5 parities. Results showed that GH, BHBA, and NEFA levels in ketotic cows were significantly higher and the GLu level significantly lower. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation of GH with BHBA, NEFA, and GLu in ketotic and healthy CON cows. In experiment-2, dynamic monitoring of LFT indices namely, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), globulin (GLOB) and albumin/globulin (A/G) were examined. The TBIL, DBIL, and GGT indices were significantly higher in ketotic cows and TP was significantly lower. In experiment-3, mRNA expression levels of GHR and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) genes in adipose tissue were significantly upregulated in ketotic cows. However, the mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-1R), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) genes in adipose tissue were downregulated in ketotic cows. Our study concluded that during postpartum, higher plasma GH levels in SCK cows might involve the initiation of body adipose tissue mobilization, resulting in hyperketonemia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afeab"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","pagesFromTo":"1-14","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["660fe96b4097076263f8b1c0","660fe96b4097076263f8b1c1","660fe96b4097076263f8b1c2","660fe96b4097076263f8b1c3","660fe96b4097076263f8b1c4","660fe96b4097076263f8b1c5","660fe96b4097076263f8b1c6","660fe96b4097076263f8b1c7","660fe96b4097076263f8b1c8","5e7093bb878c28a0473afeab","660fe96b4097076263f8b1ca","660fe96b4097076263f8b1cb","5e7092c1878c28a04739c18c","660fe96b4097076263f8b1cc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb3","mniswId":"22511","title":"Frontiers in Veterinary Science","eissn":"2297-1769","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b55ea41a-42fc-4944-8655-5f96bf0a9101"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dairy cow","subclinical ketosis","hyperketonemia","growth hormone","adipose tissue"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433576961"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63da617d4097076b4a8de0e5","name":"Paul S.","lastName":"Rose","documentHash":"5dbb90bd-2cb3-4bdb-b15e-d7140a41638b"},{"objectId":"63da617d4097076b4a8de0e4","name":"Stephen","lastName":"Mansbridge","documentHash":"f0de9cd3-bd85-413e-b329-b8a8fd0c7d5b"},{"objectId":"63da617d4097076b4a8de0e3","name":"Vasil","lastName":"Pirgozliev","documentHash":"01b8f271-ae5d-49a4-8c85-7c0f2a5ebf92"},{"objectId":"63da617d4097076b4a8de0e2","name":"Kristina","lastName":"Kijak","documentHash":"11f29cd7-9311-498d-8be2-b203da5f9c7e"},{"objectId":"63da617d4097076b4a8de0e1","name":"Isobel M.","lastName":"Whiting","documentHash":"31bd0f2f-8f49-4a8d-bd02-7a71d0e5b88f"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"},{"objectId":"5e7094ac878c28a0473c169c","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Orczewska-Dudek","uuid":"77C4D25ED8FC90F0A83FCBBE29B0FA2FE7EBB9ED89B406D4606D759B82CBDA187A91B0C087C3B44930A7325D2CC22412C8FD3D662F0EDF960A3D2F1002AA1880","orcidId":"0000-0001-6726-923X","documentHash":"ade872c5-e274-49c7-a102-8388ede8fa03"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"63da617d4097076b4a8de0df","doi":"10.1080/00071668.2022.2090229","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00071668.2022.2090229","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Feeding dihydroquercetin in wheat-based diets to laying hens: impact on egg production and quality of fresh and stored eggs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"1. This study assessed the impact of dietary dihydroquercetin (DHQ) in wheat-based diets on egg production, composition and quality when fed to laying hens. A total of 80 Hy-Line Brown hens were allocated to 20 enriched layer cages, over two tiers, in groups of four birds.2. Two wheat-based diets were used in the study. A basal diet, meeting the nutrient requirement of the hens, containing 11.56 MJ/kg AME and 172 g/kg crude protein, was mixed and split into two parts. One part was fed as prepared to the control group of birds. The second diet was made by adding 1.5 g DHQ per kg basal diet and fed to the treatment group of birds. This level was relatively high and extended the data on levels normally fed. The diets were fed in a meal form and did not contain any coccidiostat, antimicrobial growth promoters or other similar additives. Each diet was fed to hens in 10 replicate cages for 4 weeks, from 22 to 26 weeks of age, following randomisation.3. Subsequently, eggs were investigated to determine the impact of dietary DHQ on the quality variables of fresh and 28-d stored eggs.4. Overall, feeding 1.5 g/kg dietary DHQ for 4 weeks did not affect (P > 0.05) egg production or the quality of fresh and stored eggs. Any observed egg quality changes (P < 0.05) confirmed the expected effects of egg storage."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","uid":"biMkjldDwyEilXl7rx-ushQ","uuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","name":"Instytut Zootechniki - Państwowy Instytut

in aviary flocks using 3 approaches: 1) A novel Aviary Transect method, 2) AssureWel, and 3) the Norwegian farm advisors' NorWel method. The Aviary Transect time requirement, interobserver reliability, and within- and across-house sensitivity to detect welfare indicators were also evaluated. The study was conducted on 6 randomly chosen commercial white-strain layer flocks of similar age and flock size, kept in multitiered aviaries. The Aviary Transect method comprised standardized walks along each aisle while screening the whole flock for 12 welfare indicators: feather loss (FL) on head, back, breast, and tail, wounds on head, back, tail, and feet, dirty birds, enlarged crop, sick birds, and dead birds. AssureWel involved scoring FL on head and back, and dirtiness of 50 random birds, and flock-level evaluation of beak trimming, antagonistic behavior, flightiness, birds needing further care, and mortality. NorWel involved scoring 8 welfare indicators on 50 random birds: FL on head, back, breast, and tail, dirtiness, and wounds on head, back, and tail. The AssureWel detected flock differences in both minor and major FL on the back (P < 0.01) as well as somewhat dirty birds (P < 0.01). The NorWel method detected flock differences in both minor and major FL on the head (P < 0.01), back (P < 0.001), breast (P < 0.001), and tail (P < 0.001) and somewhat (score 1) dirty birds (P < 0.05). The Aviary Transect method detected flock differences in FL on head, back, breast, and tail (all P < 0.001), dirty birds (P < 0.05) and enlarged crop (P < 0.001). More birds with FL on breast, and more dirty birds, were found in wall vs. central transects (P < 0.05). There was good interobserver agreement, except for dirty birds (P < 0.01), and positive correlations (P < 0.05) were identified between the Aviary Transect method and the other sampling methods for FL on head and back, and dirtiness. The three methods took similar time to complete (about 20 min/flock). In conclusion, all 3 methods detected significant differences in welfare indicator prevalence between flocks. The new Aviary Transect method provides egg producers with an efficient and sensitive whole-flock assessment of hen welfare status in multitiered aviaries."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"101","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"101533","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646c8203409707691c4dae66","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","646c8203409707691c4dae67","646c8203409707691c4dae68","646c8203409707691c4dae69"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547934f","mniswId":"16421","title":"POULTRY SCIENCE","issn":"0032-5791","documentHash":"811483b7-60e4-4554-a4b1-68c7cbbfdd17"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646c8203409707691c4dae65","year":"2022","volume":"101","number":"1","documentHash":"c724667e-4139-457f-9148-fc4f1c25d3ce"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["animal welfare","aviary housing","laying hen","transect sampling","welfare assessment methodology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433576992"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6655d30f40970762c87ec477","name":"Emil D.

shaping balance between health\nand disease. Until now, the course of pregnancy was believed to be a sterile environment. However,\nrecent studies have suggested that microbial populations are present in the fetus also prior to birth.\nPresent study for the first time looked at the origin of fetal gut microbiota in mice model, and\nindicated its exact route of transmission. Our data was able to report for the first time signature\nof microbial presence during fetal development, by identifying commensal microbiota as early as\nfew days after implantation, including both bacterial and fungi species. Interestingly, we detected\nfew species specifically related to gestation period. This strongly indicates that the first colonization\noccurs prenatally with species specificity manner. In conclusion, the study provides a great basis\nfor tests on possible modulation properties of detected key-players microbes. The promising results\ncould become a potential for future biotherapies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709392878c28a0473ad00f","5e70933b878c28a0473a5603","5e7092b0878c28a04739abd3","5e7092bc878c28a04739bb91","63881fb975234052dad4666e","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e709499878c28a0473c02b2","5e70946f878c28a0473bcf1b","5e709383878c28a0473ab9a6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602f5d909543c7410626f3b2"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"40","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"99-110","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709499878c28a0473c02b2","5e70933b878c28a0473a5603","63881fb975234052dad4666e","5e709392878c28a0473ad00f","5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b02","602f5d909543c7410626f3b2","5e7092b0878c28a04739abd3","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e70946f878c28a0473bcf1b","5e709383878c28a0473ab9a6","5e7092bc878c28a04739bb91"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547703a","mniswId":"1152","title":"Animal Science Papers and Reports","issn":"0860-4037","eissn":"2300-8342","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"fe90747c-1196-49b0-9210-8098e8db0aa8"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fetal development","genomics","gut microbiome","microbiota","NGS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433577037"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d1e7504097071d34b9dc4f","name":"Daria M.","lastName":"Urbańska","documentHash":"3a82e5df-71f1-460c-bcdc-1fe010b64f73"},{"objectId":"63d1e7504097071d34b9dc4e","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Kawecka-Grochocka","documentHash":"a8e97a4c-6819-4aea-897f-c091f2ead8cb"},{"objectId":"619325b87523400e6371e270","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Brzozowska","uuid":"057B6AFC4F640953DD990B297E8313A0E7BA226ACB46399EB5796F96651573E5ADB4AEAB1C3A3C49E6DE22712A390F18CD2754C2CA5E69DEF70F931FF7C5E17B","documentHash":"10d20b59-8c3a-4a91-b5c0-f8c6e21cf1aa"},{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b95f6","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zalewska","uuid":"F873D6D30C9FD57AAC837183D68DB7C44938598F0EE95F6428FD3FF3F512CD39129230A9105725E9B92802874574D7D36791DF64D8A528FEC6B7AAFD6A881C8C","orcidId":"0000-0001-5547-4607","documentHash":"322847e4-2550-40ec-96e2-58b1bba4a1ef"},{"objectId":"5e7093e7878c28a0473b2ff8","name":"Michał","lastName":"Czopowicz","uuid":"0936C2FBA4790C73089172B48BE3F9E44080C07C90BA7BC6D824E01283087DA0299466B1805A061C195494C5E63040C00B92CF33E1C30D1FC5C6851AAF3633BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-4238-8360","documentHash":"949489ca-ee7c-4eb9-8f3e-acd3c56852f9"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bb64","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kapusta","uuid":"25FAE2F4508327A630DFA7768613CD934A1F514C62A4B559D8D84C0228945BCBD7DF82A64C3315212A3531F995410C44618BCDD0987A68B8EB277AF6922F1C21","orcidId":"0000-0003-0597-4077","documentHash":"45b1681d-5f88-4983-9e1f-e2ab87000e23"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a04739966f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Bagnicka","uuid":"0D37A8BCF2F4D93F59FC1D87DBDADCE868EF14AFD99EBF96C877CC86963C73AE2E470CED6B83A3F731B3B08724BDCE11D9A8CE8A0CE7E36513995F6A5C4D000D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7193-2006","documentHash":"a42098e0-b6d5-4d75-b67b-2d9b112c9c92"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a0473920d8","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Kaba","uuid":"36E319611AD5EC867447F61242DBDE4D84C68C0B2FD400A709FAE4ADDB6E1680D6DCA67F81FD2C5C9CCADC94CE74B1B22FF8FF156DEB14A3A25FEB4C5B9F1CD6","orcidId":"0000-0002-7977-9875","documentHash":"23924290-37ae-47fe-ba29-5405814dd86a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63d1e7504097071d34b9dc4b","doi":"10.3390/ani12212948","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of Supplementation with Organic Selenium or Turmeric and Rosemary Mixture on Beta-Defensin Content in Goat Milk","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>The present study examines the effects of diet supplementation with an organic selenium or herb-spice mixture on beta-defensin1 (GBD-1) and beta-defensin2 (GBD-2) concentrations in goat milk.

The Herd I control group demonstrated higher fat, free fatty acid, and somatic cell levels and lower protein and lactose contents than Herd II controls. The GBD-1 concentration was below the detection limit in both herds. Herd I controls demonstrated higher GBD-2 concentrations in milk than Herd II controls. In addition, lower GBD-2 concentrations were noted in PWI goat milk. Organic selenium or rosemary-turmeric mixture supplementation had no effect on the GBD-2 content in the milk of healthy goats.

of Polysaccharide–Peptide Conjugates Containing the RGD Motif for Potential Use in Muscle Tissue Regeneration","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"New scaffold materials composed of biodegradable components are of great interest in regenerative medicine. These materials should be: stable, nontoxic, and biodegrade slowly and steadily, allowing the stable release of biodegradable and biologically active substances. We analyzed peptide-polysaccharide conjugates derived from peptides containing RGD motif (H-RGDS-OH (1), H-GRGDS-NH2 (2), and cyclo(RGDfC) (3)) and polysaccharides as scaffolds to select the most appropriate biomaterials for application in regenerative medicine. Based on the results of MTT and Ki-67 assays, we can state that the conjugates containing calcium alginate and the ternary nonwoven material were the most supportive of muscle tissue regeneration. Scanning electron microscopy imaging and light microscopy studies with hematoxylin–eosin staining showed that C2C12 cells were able to interact with the tested peptide–polysaccharide conjugates. The release factor (Q) varied depending on both the peptide and the structure of the polysaccharide matrix. LDH, Alamarblue®, Ki-67, and cell cycle assays indicated that peptides 1 and 2 were characterized by the best biological properties.

Little is known about the changes in iron-related proteins in the human HF myocardium. The purpose of this study was to assess iron-related proteins in non-failing (NFH) vs. failing (FH) human myocardium. The study group consisted of 58 explanted FHs; control consisted of 31 NFHs unsuitable for transplantation. Myocardial proteins expressions: divalent metal transporter (DMT-1); L-type calcium channel (L-CH); transferrin receptors (TfR-1/TfR-2); ferritins: heavy (FT-H) or light (FT-L) chain, mitochondrial (FT-MT); ferroportin (FPN), regulatory factors and oxidative stress marker: 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). In FH, the expression in almost all proteins responsible for iron transport: DMT-1, TfR-1, L-CH, except TfR-2, and storage: FT-H/-L/-MT were reduced, with no changes in FPN. Moreover, 4-HNE expression (pg/mg; NFH 10.6 ± 8.4 vs. FH 55.7 ± 33.7; p < 0.0001) in FH was increased. HNE-4 significantly correlated with DMT-1 (r = −0.377, p = 0.036), L-CH (r = −0.571, p = 0.001), FT-H (r = −0.379, p = 0.036), also FPN (r = 0.422, p = 0.018). Reducing iron-gathering proteins and elevated oxidative stress in failing hearts is very unfavorable for myocardiocytes. It should be taken into consideration before treatment with drugs or supplements that elevate free oxygen radicals in the heart."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6651","5e709400878c28a0473b4a63","5e709428878c28a0473b7584","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded2","uid":"bhtjxujYsJBDWqZPLXLXOmg","uuid":"30b10b1f-ec48-467e-961f-2ac6fcbeee11","name":"Instytut Chemii i Techniki Jądrowej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c64","5e709453878c28a0473ba6cc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded2","parentUuid":"30b10b1f-ec48-467e-961f-2ac6fcbeee11","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded2","rootUuid":"30b10b1f-ec48-467e-961f-2ac6fcbeee11","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1-17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709428878c28a0473b7584","67e11c87fdbe831b597ed6f5","5e709453878c28a0473ba6cc","5e709347878c28a0473a6651","67e11c87fdbe831b597ed6f8","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","67e11c87fdbe831b597ed6fb","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c64","67e11c87fdbe831b597ed6fd","5e709400878c28a0473b4a63"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","eissn":"2077-0383","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"11fb906d-8d54-4e42-be05-fb426fe7219b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["heart failure","myocardial iron metabolism","oxidative stress;","myocardial gathering proteins expression","human model"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433577087"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63881fb975234052dad46665","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Jaszczyk","uuid":"6F9183570EEF8A13FFB3B0980E4D63BFC38B702A6DDB1148D723147AA7EF55E20F6E47A486E2BB561878F690F45AF99E21F6ABCC770BCC05FD6A6162F5D7653C","documentHash":"d1dffe61-20d1-4db0-9ca0-4bb793f13190"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c02a5","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Stankiewicz","uuid":"2DECC35439ECF87D059D42D92296066E05C0AA8DE7B8FFD4F09DA8B0E0A253149F6136C34EA33D1CACE7ED7C3F7B831E38C27543932B195CB25E4D00CA1D9854","orcidId":"0000-0002-2719-6205","documentHash":"c3212fb5-ce3c-4e8e-a524-18b6b2434a50"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a047399816","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Juszczak","uuid":"FB152F95AA9FDF3EA1252BAC1246F50E008E79910F6D1C008E29CE496FB3C201327F63D7E16E442C7A57255989F45467E859FD5D5F70935449D9EE12F5374E47","orcidId":"0000-0002-0976-6905","documentHash":"e74e1445-37b1-4c71-9e67-0b2491d57755"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646dc4a84097077040489332","doi":"10.3390/brainsci12060799","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/6/799/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Dissection of Mouse Hippocampus with Its Dorsal, Intermediate and Ventral Subdivisions Combined with Molecular Validation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Many research methods applied in molecular neuroscience require the collection of hippocampal samples, but a still poorly recognized problem is contamination with the choroid plexus during brain dissection. Because of a distinct pattern of gene expression, its inclusion in brain samples can obscure or even confound conclusions drawn from molecular studies. Therefore, we tested our dissection method designed for removal of tissue contamination using expression of the transthyretin gene (Ttr) as a marker of the choroid plexus. Additionally, we also validated dissection of the entire hippocampus into its dorsal, intermediate and ventral subdivisions using the expression of Trhr and Lct genes as molecular markers of anatomical subdivisions. The PCR analysis showed that Ttr is expressed at a residual level in hippocampal samples that display an mRNA level several hundred lower than the adjacent control tissue colocalized with the choroid plexus. This indicates that the applied method for dissecting the hippocampus from a fresh brain allows for replicable removal of the majority of choroid plexus from hippocampal samples. In turn, differences in expression of Lct and Trhr confirmed the proper dissection of dorsal, intermediate and ventral subdivisions from fresh brain tissue. Therefore, a special emphasis on the removal of tissue contamination and avoidance of tissue distortions makes our protocol especially suitable for molecular experiments performed either on the entire hippocampus or its subdivisions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a047399816","63881fb975234052dad46665","5e709499878c28a0473c02a5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"799","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63881fb975234052dad46665","5e709499878c28a0473c02a5","5e7092a1878c28a047399816"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bbc1","mniswId":"2760","title":"Brain Sciences","issn":"2076-3425","eissn":"2076-3425","documentHash":"c358e032-ec0f-4775-aa68-25c4f2bc5b7b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"638ca2ed409707231d9f89c0","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"6","documentHash":"19bd345c-0a01-4c52-9514-b25ce7edcc07"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dissection","dorsal","hippocampus","intermediate","mice","ventral"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433577095"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646c7f0d409707691c4d97aa","name":"Harald","lastName":"Willschke","documentHash":"025de962-89a4-4613-8c6a-252a576c0fed"},{"objectId":"646c7f0d409707691c4d97a9","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kletecka-Pulker","documentHash":"cf728bfc-e420-4efe-9c1e-b2cdaf4dba4b"},{"objectId":"646c7f0d409707691c4d97a8","name":"Rehab A.","lastName":"Rayan","documentHash":"1030cf84-5902-4393-917f-1aa9fce308b8"},{"objectId":"646c7f0d409707691c4d97a7","name":"Faisal A.","lastName":"Nawaz","documentHash":"2d03e4d9-3a8a-4c48-9d10-1502b2851bac"},{"objectId":"646c7f0d409707691c4d97a6","name":"Emil D.","lastName":"Parvanov","documentHash":"664314e9-1e75-4a8f-a8d3-196e6bda5006"},{"objectId":"646c7f0d409707691c4d97a5","name":"Andy Wai Kan","lastName":"Yeung","documentHash":"241090e8-3966-4588-a290-ac364575581d"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646c7f0d409707691c4d97a4","doi":"10.3390/ijerph191912493","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/19/12493/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Tests: Bibliometric Analysis of the Scientific Literature","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt health systems worldwide, conducting Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) at specified intervals has become an essential part of many people's lives around the world. We identified and analyzed the academic literature on COVID-19 RAT. The Web of Science electronic database was queried on 6 July 2022 to find relevant publications. Publication and citation data were retrieved directly from the database. VOSviewer, a bibliometric software, was then used to relate these data to the semantic content from the titles, abstracts, and keywords. The analysis was based on data from 1000 publications. The most productive authors were from Japan and the United States, led by Dr. Koji Nakamura from Japan (n = 10, 1.0%). The most academically productive countries were in the North America, Europe and Asia, led by the United States of America (n = 266, 26.6%). Sensitivity (n = 32, 3.2%) and specificity (n = 23, 2.3%) were among the most frequently recurring author keywords. Regarding sampling methods, \"saliva\" (n = 54, 5.4%) was mentioned more frequently than \"nasal swab\" (n = 32, 3.2%) and \"nasopharyngeal swab\" (n = 22, 2.2%). Recurring scenarios that required RAT were identified: emergency department, healthcare worker, mass screening, airport, traveler, and workplace. Our bibliometric analysis revealed that COVID-19 RAT has been utilized in a range of studies. RAT results were cross-checked with RT-PCR tests for sensitivity and specificity. These results are consistent with comparable exchanges of methods, results or discussions among laboratorians, authors, institutions and publishers in the involved countries of the world."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"12493","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646c7f0d409707691c4d97a5","646c7f0d409707691c4d97a6","646c7f0d409707691c4d97a7","646c7f0d409707691c4d97a8","646c7f0d409707691c4d97a9","646c7f0d409707691c4d97aa","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","issn":"1660-4601","eissn":"1660-4601","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"bad4d5e4-600e-403a-9e35-0edb9dd89452"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632c318b4097076d6d4097e6","year":"2022","volume":"19","number":"19","documentHash":"0fc9355f-eb39-4312-8d13-c2c37c3ec2a3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","ARS-CoV-2","coronavirus","lateral flow test","nasal swab","nasopharyngeal swab","pandemic","public health surveillance","rapid antigen test","saliva"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433577099"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094e9878c28a0473c6c0a","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Tomasiuk","uuid":"926D61F8B15BC1322822A42302DF7AD31931B9FDE8DFEE76E0C9F3D086C646878A56F7868E3B2105784C7655151A0594DCD2B7205A3866A9C2AD18395793B9FC","documentHash":"1c7487ab-7559-4b08-b0ae-e73a243ac4f9"},{"objectId":"5e709466878c28a0473bc249","name":"Marta","lastName":"Ogorzałek","uuid":"752EA926DFE6C168CC4215E8439A7E379A071A8B40D02E9385C52AE1BED3BDD9EA038DA0A565E5A99E4AB2D33D0CB74A981AE617544CBC0A26B4909C65BF214B","orcidId":"0000-0002-1896-1876","documentHash":"c0cab8f3-d63a-43ed-962b-fe61fe98727c"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b633a","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Markuszewski","uuid":"F83FD4288A4F9F9656BDD7148DE4F835BF5BA621E41F455B92647BA3D357A8933E90B9785CFD2DFAA1A3FC99EA1D947C166D4E5932BCBDA37D66568A8832B64E","documentHash":"6c333987-a851-433d-8be5-c5ca08969963"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a63","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Lewicki","uuid":"B90CF686103E1B1C6A43B2B48DF9445471E971741F9FEE62AD82AB04CF07C8D5E669352FED8A72279F83B28CEFE41F2B89D4E1A814514D3B03BD970250CE91BF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0539-0680","documentHash":"b3e5410d-c6e6-42f2-a407-b5005f052984"},{"objectId":"5e7093d0878c28a0473b12a6","name":"EMILIA","lastName":"KLIMASZEWSKA","uuid":"28BDA8E947C933D9A8E86914D591D33E2029B9B39C70B866FBFB52467A9F8B8931A3FBE900773C69061BF4E98E83100819CA5EDE7FF79613991E53D26D57AAC2","orcidId":"0000-0002-5621-5911","documentHash":"d35d61d8-4a5b-4d98-92c4-a4d0c8f48413"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abe86","name":"Marta","lastName":"Stelmasiak","uuid":"0F8AF02037213210BAA257897CE8ABB198EDAE1EEFF298BEE6FDC87644ED90506B369BEBE66A3A012C0D321ABCD422C4EFA5EA16906943FFF34D798021FE1D6E","documentHash":"649c73d1-51e2-4f06-ac3a-21fbff3680d4"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"92D7C04F8AB3A7BAFDD427A486DDA8E51BB9EF910CE1748A4A41C1B5DD9D2FBC73939751C42B68AF9AB4431CFBC5570C935A57B7BE63B7045AA234AF1888672B","documentHash":"da59b83b-fda3-4817-8136-ba0e1298aa2f"},{"objectId":"5e709250878c28a047393964","name":"Daria","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"6D270270F28000E7D2AE143E2C550EA6E31AA68D44B695FB413C48055C6631F2B61DB9FA7E9F17B7E34F00DC968D98E6BF4479CEDDAD3012F3753FCE2C591692","orcidId":"0000-0003-1628-7379","documentHash":"28810139-6d9d-425d-b1b9-fe2e668e5ea8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"636a2e394097073ba7110694","doi":"10.3390/molecules27175425","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/17/5425/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of New Surfactants on Biological Properties of Liquid Soaps","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Liquid soaps are the basic cosmetics used to clean the skin of the hands. Frequent hand washing prevents viral contamination but may damage the skin’s hydro-lipid layer, leading to various types of irritation. Therefore, four liquid soap formulas were developed with three amphoteric surfactants: Cocamidopropyl Betaine (LS II), CocamidopropylHydroxysultaine (LS III), and newly synthesized Evening PrimroseaamidopropylSulfobetaine (LS IV). We evaluated the skin irritating potential (zein number, bovine albumin test) and cytotoxicity (AlamarBlue™, Cell viability, and Cell cycle assays) on HaCaT cell line. We observed lower values of the zein number and bovine albumin tests after adding soaps with surfactants (the highest differences in LS IV) compared to the base soap (LS I). However, LS I and LS II did not differ in cytotoxic assays. Therefore, adding LS III and LS IV seems potentially more dangerous to the cells. However, it should be noted that cells were continuously exposed to liquid soaps for more than 24 h, so its cytotoxic effects after dermal use in humans may be unnoticeable. Concluding, results suggest that the newly synthesized LS IV should improve the safety of liquid hand washing soaps"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709400878c28a0473b4a63","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

I suggest multilevel chemopreventive and anticancer mechanisms of action, which are shared by multiple dietary natural phenols. Specifically, I cite evidence that curcumin and resveratrol have multilevel anti-cancer effects through: (1) inducing either p53-dependent or p53-independent apoptosis in cancer cell lines, (2) acting as potent regulators of expression of oncogenic and anti-oncogenic microRNAs, and (3) inducing complex epigenetic changes that can switch off oncogenes/switch on anti-oncogenes. There is no simple reductionist explanation for anti-cancer effects of curcumin and resveratrol. More generally, multilevel models of chemoprevention are suggested for related natural phenols and flavonoids such as genistein, quercetin, or luteolin."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c0878c28a0473c3159"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"14957","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094c0878c28a0473c3159"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6384739340970732086c26b4","year":"2022","volume":"23","number":"23","documentHash":"44b1dee3-77bc-4dae-9d8c-ed7adc3af6f9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["chemoprevention","cancer","curcumin","resveratrol","genistein","quercetin","luteolin","genomics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433577113"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646dc15d4097077040485b3d","name":"Pooja","lastName":"Chawla","documentHash":"a696e8ae-3b70-43d3-a25b-7d44323978ad"},{"objectId":"646dc15d4097077040485b3c","name":"Reena","lastName":"Gupta","documentHash":"a159a6d8-c6ad-4841-a3e4-a02cdddd3114"},{"objectId":"646dc15d4097077040485b3b","name":"Qushmua","lastName":"Alzahrani","documentHash":"213637aa-8a10-4501-85ac-ce8e55708362"},{"objectId":"646dc15d4097077040485b3a","name":"Pooja","lastName":"Rani","documentHash":"19ac06cc-256d-46a8-85ea-5851402dc683"},{"objectId":"646dc15d4097077040485b39","name":"Ravleen","lastName":"Kaur","documentHash":"c9f7da33-a224-436e-9f48-e306c96829a6"},{"objectId":"646dc15d4097077040485b38","name":"Monica","lastName":"Gulati","documentHash":"352579b3-60a8-4b08-84c9-10a26d555a9f"},{"objectId":"646dc15d4097077040485b37","name":"Bhupinder","lastName":"Kapoor","documentHash":"97a29d3c-768a-4693-ba18-e34092686e38"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"646dc15d4097077040485b35","doi":"10.2174/1570193x19666211221150119","publicUri":"https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/download?doi=10.2174/1570193X19666211221150119","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Discovery and Development of Antibacterial Agents: Fortuitous and Designed","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Today, antibacterial drug resistance has turned into a significant public health issue. Repeated intake, suboptimal and/or unnecessary use of antibiotics, and, additionally, the transfer of resistance genes are the critical elements that make microorganisms resistant to conventional antibiotics. A substantial number of antibacterials that were successfully utilized earlier for prophylaxis and therapeutic purposes have been rendered inadequate due to this phenomenon. Therefore, the exploration of new molecules has become a continuous endeavour. Many such molecules are at various stages of the investigation. A surprisingly high number of new molecules are currently in the stage of phase 3 clinical trials. A few new agents have been commercialized in the last decade. These include solithromycin, plazomicin, lefamulin, omadacycline, eravacycline, delafloxacin, zabofloxacin, finafloxacin, nemonoxacin, gepotidacin, zoliflodacin, cefiderocol, BAL30072, avycaz, zerbaxa, vabomere, relebactam, tedizolid, cadazolid, sutezolid, triclosan, and afabiacin. This article aims to review the investigational and recently approved antibacterials with a focus on their structure, mechanisms of action/resistance, and spectrum of activity. Delving deep, their success or otherwise in various phases of clinical trials is also discussed while attributing the same to various causal

complex neurodegenerative disease with multifactorial etiology, unsatisfactory treatment, and a necessity for broad-spectrum active substances for cure. The mucus from Helix aspersa snail is a mixture of bioactive molecules with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects. So far there are no data concerning the capacity of snail extract (SE) to affect neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nObjective: The effects of SE from Helix aspersa on learning and memory deficits in Alzheimer's type dementia (ATD) induced by scopolamine (Sco) in male Wistar rats were examined and some mechanisms of action underlying these effects were evaluated.\n\nMethods: SE (0.5 mL/100 g) was applied orally through a food tube for 16 consecutive days: 5 days before and 11 days simultaneously with Sco (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). At the end of Sco treatment, using behavioral methods, we evaluated memory performance. Additionally, in cortex and hippocampus the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, acetylcholine and monoamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) content, levels of main oxidative stress markers, and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were determined.\n\nResults: We demonstrated that, according to all behavioral tests used, SE significantly improved the cognitive deficits induced by Sco. Furthermore, SE possessed AChE inhibitory activity, moderate antioxidant properties and the ability to modulate monoamines content in two brain structures. Moreover, multiple SE applications not only restored the depressed by Sco expression of CREB and BDNF, but significantly upregulated it.\n\nConclusion: Summarizing results, we conclude that complex mechanisms underlie the beneficial effects of SE on impaired memory in Alzheimer's type dementia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"88","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"155-175","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646dbbbc4097077040480472","646dbbbc4097077040480473","646dbbbc4097077040480474","646dbbbc4097077040480475","646dbbbc4097077040480476","646dbbbc4097077040480477","646dbbbc4097077040480478","646dbbbc4097077040480479","646dbbbc409707704048047a","646dbbbc409707704048047b","646dbbbc409707704048047c","646dbbbc409707704048047d","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","646dbbbc409707704048047e","646dbbbc409707704048047f","646dbbbc4097077040480480","646dbbbc4097077040480481","646dbbbc4097077040480482","646dbbbc4097077040480483"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478449","mniswId":"10088","title":"Journal of Alzheimer's Disease","issn":"1387-2877","eissn":"1875-8908","documentHash":"9d2b6957-0c42-4ebd-bb03-5b084b8a42fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646dbbbc4097077040480471","year":"2022","volume":"88","number":"1","documentHash":"8b6c5b9d-075a-4cde-913c-ee44410c1b7c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Antioxidant system","BDNF","CREB","cholinergic function","scopolamine","snail Helix aspersa"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654797702"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663b37a54097070c4ce19b51","name":"Damian","lastName":"Matak","documentHash":"a326da27-2722-4562-8797-7ca7ed299c95"},{"objectId":"663b37a54097070c4ce19b50","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Gromadka","documentHash":"49e10766-b247-43f9-907b-c18536d408a4"},{"objectId":"663b37a54097070c4ce19b4f","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Gołębiewska","documentHash":"6f0ccf1f-fc40-4e80-9a14-5583e5b82a49"},{"objectId":"663b37a54097070c4ce19b4e","name":"Judyta","lastName":"Kaczyńska","documentHash":"2491a5f2-4fde-4f01-9a74-e4a753f54da3"},{"objectId":"663b37a54097070c4ce19b4d","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Małkowska","documentHash":"5b371676-b3d9-4820-8c48-8f7f14af699b"},{"objectId":"663b37a54097070c4ce19b4c","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Gołaszewska","documentHash":"d08aa78b-79e3-452a-b2cf-d92b43507a29"},{"objectId":"663b37a54097070c4ce19b4b","name":"Lukasz","lastName":"Szymanski","documentHash":"e7022b8f-94bc-44e2-a790-66df4abf3d89"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"92D7C04F8AB3A7BAFDD427A486DDA8E51BB9EF910CE1748A4A41C1B5DD9D2FBC73939751C42B68AF9AB4431CFBC5570C935A57B7BE63B7045AA234AF1888672B","documentHash":"da59b83b-fda3-4817-8136-ba0e1298aa2f"}],"objectId":"663b37a54097070c4ce19b49","doi":"10.2147/mder.s407838","publicUri":"https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=90307","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Safety and Performance of Hemostatic Powders","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Hemorrhage, a sudden and severe leakage of blood due to the disruption of blood vessels, is one of the most common causes of death from injuries worldwide. Severe bleeding accounts for more than 35% of pre-hospital deaths and about 40% of deaths recorded within 24 hours of injury. One of the methods for achieving homeostasis is the use of hemostatic powders. This study compares the basic safety and performance of the most popular hemostatic powders.\nMethods: Basic safety of commercially available products were evaluated using MTT, MEM elution assay, and endotoxin testing. The in vitro performance was evaluated using water absorption capacity, water absorption rate, and adhesion strength assays.\nResults: 4Seal, Starsil, and 4DryField extracts did not cause cytotoxicity in MTT and MEM elution assays. PerClot and SuperClot extracts demonstrated cytotoxic potential in MTT assay, while Arista extract was cytotoxic in both MEM elution and MTT assays. 4Seal has the lowest endotoxin contamination, followed by PerClot, 4DryField, SuperClot, Arista, and Starsil. 4Seal and Starsil showed significantly highest WAR among the tested samples, followed by 4DryField, Arista, PerClot, and SuperClot. Adhesion force is highest for 4Seal, followed by Starsil, PerClot, 4DryField Arista, and SuperClot.\nConclusion: 4Seal is the most versatile in terms of safety and functional properties compared to 4DryField, Arista, PerClot, Starsil, and SuperClot."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"Volume 16","pagesFromTo":"133-144","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663b37a54097070c4ce19b4b","663b37a54097070c4ce19b4c","663b37a54097070c4ce19b4d","663b37a54097070c4ce19b4e","663b37a54097070c4ce19b4f","663b37a54097070c4ce19b50","663b37a54097070c4ce19b51","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cc64","mniswId":"14135","title":"Medical Devices-Evidence and Research","issn":"1179-1470","eissn":"1179-1470","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"df36e111-e57a-4b5d-b542-695c9cb50fba"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"663b37a54097070c4ce19b4a","year":"2023","volume":"Volume 16","documentHash":"76635277-4af0-414c-938f-afd291aeef3e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hemostasis, hemostatic powder, bleeding, 4DryField, 4Seal, Arista, PerClot, Starsil, SuperClot"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654944837"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b54f4fdbe8318b4cb1d09","name":"Talha B.","lastName":"Emran","documentHash":"40dacb55-c7c1-434e-b70a-a120dd186da2"},{"objectId":"679b54f4fdbe8318b4cb1d08","name":"Priyanka","lastName":"V","documentHash":"564ead82-74c4-4367-80fe-1d5aaf67a43a"},{"objectId":"679b54f4fdbe8318b4cb1d07","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Mofatteh","documentHash":"3e2e7613-fca9-4eba-a324-92c47ee70c38"},{"objectId":"679b54f4fdbe8318b4cb1d06","name":"Ramesh","lastName":"Kandimalla","documentHash":"bc5d6edd-f9e7-41b3-8b70-050bbff8c772"},{"objectId":"679b54f4fdbe8318b4cb1d05","name":"Vishnu P.","lastName":"Prasad","documentHash":"03644494-9a7c-44ae-9f91-036c1d9824bb"},{"objectId":"679b54f4fdbe8318b4cb1d04","name":"Maudlyn O.","lastName":"Etekochay","documentHash":"96396be0-5e15-4652-b6b9-de21d50734a0"},{"objectId":"679b54f4fdbe8318b4cb1d03","name":"Saad","lastName":"Irfan","documentHash":"add83d6c-7617-4129-a99e-e1b13f0c2e60"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"679b54f4fdbe8318b4cb1d01","doi":"10.1097/js9.0000000000001460","publicUri":"https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/JS9.0000000000001460","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Human olfactory neurosphere-derived cells: a unified tool for neurological disease modelling and neurotherapeutic applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"As one of the leading causes of global mortality and morbidity, various neurological diseases cause social and economic burdens.

Furthermore, the collection of postmortem brain tissues limits their usage in cultured cell lines. Overcoming such limitations has prompted the usage of stem cells derived from the peripheral nervous system, such as the cells of the olfactory mucosa as a preferred choice. These cells can be easily cultured in vitro and retain the receptors of neuronal cells life-long. Such cells have various advantages over embryonic or induced stem cells, including homology, and ease of culture and can be conveniently obtained from diseased individuals through either biopsies or exfoliation. They have continuously helped in understanding the genetic and developmental mechanisms of degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

The past few decades have witnessed significant strides in comprehending the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and developing diagnostic methodologies for AD, such as neuroimaging approaches. Neuroimaging techniques, including positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, have revolutionized the field by providing valuable insights into the structural and functional alterations in the brains of individuals with AD. These imaging modalities enable the detection of early biomarkers such as amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles, facilitating early and precise diagnosis. Furthermore, the emerging technologies encompassing blood-based biomarkers and neurochemical profiling exhibit promising results in the identification of specific molecular signatures for AD. The integration of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence has enhanced the predictive capacity of these diagnostic tools when analyzing complex datasets. In this review article, we will highlight not only some of the most used diagnostic imaging approaches in neurodegeneration research but focus much more on new tools like artificial intelligence, emphasizing their application in the realm of AD. These advancements hold immense potential for early detection and intervention, thereby paving the way for personalized therapeutic strategies and ultimately augmenting the quality of life for individuals affected by AD."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"99","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-20","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67a1c1a6fdbe83433d28f445","67a1c1a6fdbe83433d28f446","67a1c1a6fdbe83433d28f447","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","67a1c1a6fdbe83433d28f448","67a1c1a6fdbe83433d28f449","67a1c1a6fdbe83433d28f44a","67a1c1a6fdbe83433d28f44b","67a1c1a6fdbe83433d28f44c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478449","mniswId":"10088","title":"Journal of Alzheimer's Disease","issn":"1387-2877","eissn":"1875-8908","documentHash":"9d2b6957-0c42-4ebd-bb03-5b084b8a42fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67a1c1a6fdbe83433d28f444","year":"2024","volume":"99","number":"1","documentHash":"2789069e-e715-4537-9585-c84e45a303d8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Alzheimer’s disease; artificial intelligence; biomarker; machine learning; neuroimaging"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654958478"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66b5c77efdbe836dd0c44de1","name":"Raúl David","lastName":"Guevara","documentHash":"122c2d2d-d3b6-4c14-a010-583e6db53353"},{"objectId":"66b5c77efdbe836dd0c44de0","name":"Pol","lastName":"Llonch","documentHash":"e7d4e164-33e9-4cac-ad9b-d384ff7a87e6"},{"objectId":"5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","name":"Irene","lastName":"Camerlink","uuid":"63511C46590F3B7E26AA60526C552EED8D9F0549F8DEE5333E681582883DA44BB38FF69E2CB85D2955FD7C17DC6CFA4F35E7BE97ABD84CE52B2422233F186398","documentHash":"21f3e447-93d1-4634-92b3-8aae9343fdc4"}],"objectId":"66b5c77efdbe836dd0c44ddf","doi":"10.1016/b978-0-323-85676-8.00024-9","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:B9780323856768000249?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Effects of climate change on pig welfare","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Climate projections estimate an increase in global temperature and a higher occurrence of extreme climate events in the near future, which may impact pig husbandry on a global scale. The resilience of pig production systems has a limit over which adaptation will not be possible. This will affect the welfare of pigs but also the productive capacity of pig farming, especially in those systems with less technological and financial capacity to react to climate change. This chapter recognises the main risks associated with climate change, including heat stress, exposure to extreme climate events, and the appearance of new diseases. Heat stress is the most obvious consequence. However, research and innovation has revealed strategies capable of reducing its negative consequences, including building insulation, ventilation, breeding for resilience, and nutritional strategies. Extreme climate events (e.g. droughts, fires, floods, hurricanes, etc.) can also impose significant risks for pig welfare. This risk has been scarcely investigated, but existent research agrees that collaboration between veterinarians and governmental bodies is crucial to design and implement effective evacuation protocols. The arrival of new diseases may also be a consequence of climate change, mediated by parasitic, microbial, and viral pathogens. Strategies to overcome the appearance of new diseases should focus on anticipating their arrival so the relevant preventative strategies can be implemented. Climate change brings a number of threats to pig farming, especially for animal welfare. However, innovative solutions may help to offset its negative effects and research should focus on helping to predict these risks and find the most cost-effective mitigating strategies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"557-576","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66b5c77efdbe836dd0c44de0","66b5c77efdbe836dd0c44de1","5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"66b5b493fdbe836dd0c35a49","title":"Advances in Pig Welfare","year":2023,"isbn":"978-0-323-85676-8","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780323856768/advances-in-pig-welfare?via=ihub=#book-info","translation":false,"documentHash":"01319901-f198-40db-b0c1-3becf0c2d102","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb923","mniswId":"64600","name":"Woodhead Publishing","documentHash":"0ff30de7-da8a-4b09-9034-ab1678636d20"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pigs, animal welfare, climate change, husbandry"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654974609"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66b5b7cbfdbe836dd0c38105","name":"Emma M.","lastName":"Baxter","documentHash":"4f1bc565-2e72-4bb7-b8f1-f6387132c946"},{"objectId":"5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","name":"Irene","lastName":"Camerlink","uuid":"63511C46590F3B7E26AA60526C552EED8D9F0549F8DEE5333E681582883DA44BB38FF69E2CB85D2955FD7C17DC6CFA4F35E7BE97ABD84CE52B2422233F186398","documentHash":"21f3e447-93d1-4634-92b3-8aae9343fdc4"}],"objectId":"66b5b7cbfdbe836dd0c38104","doi":"10.1016/b978-0-323-85676-8.00019-5","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:B9780323856768000195?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Pigs’ needs and wants","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Animal welfare is inherently related to animals’ needs and wants.

Yet despite their acceptance as the basis for minimal welfare standards, it can be argued that many of the freedoms, and thus animals’ needs, are not actually met for pigs kept under commercially intensive conditions. This is particularly the case regarding the ‘Freedom to express normal behaviour’. In many cases, normal behaviour is not merely a desire but innate and needs to be performed in order to remain physically or psychologically healthy or to produce healthy offspring.

However, there is a common misconception that just adding items into animals’ housing can be called enrichment, without careful consideration if the environmental modification is biologically meaningful for the animals and if their welfare has indeed improved. This chapter takes a reflective approach, introduces the background, and discusses some issues with enrichment studies and practical enrichment provision for pigs. Furthermore, we discuss suitable enrichment provisions for different age categories of pigs, e.g. piglets, weaners, finishers, sows, boars, etc., considering their biological needs at various stages. We do not provide a comprehensive literature review but focus on the most recent advances of the past 5 years since the last version of this book was published."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"289-308","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66b5b8d6fdbe836dd0c382fb","66b5b8d6fdbe836dd0c382fc","5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"66b5b493fdbe836dd0c35a49","title":"Advances in Pig Welfare","year":2023,"isbn":"978-0-323-85676-8","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780323856768/advances-in-pig-welfare?via=ihub=#book-info","translation":false,"documentHash":"01319901-f198-40db-b0c1-3becf0c2d102","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb923","mniswId":"64600","name":"Woodhead Publishing","documentHash":"0ff30de7-da8a-4b09-9034-ab1678636d20"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pigs, animal welfare, environmental enrichment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655004057"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3da540970762633a57e0","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Zbroja","documentHash":"4fa34b47-4aa0-4cd5-b9fc-fd5a400fb2f6"},{"objectId":"662a3da540970762633a57de","name":"Mirosław P.","lastName":"Polak","documentHash":"0650222c-eac1-4c7c-8391-9cac6be7a7c2"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5eb","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Klimowicz-Bodys","uuid":"DB1668B32E832FB7ACAD278A84179674D359FF05BA6150FA66C685008888C8B4B80F2B3A9BBCEB1626378F2957B2683744A81A0A89161C0D1FB9CEB38F0F2141","orcidId":"0000-0002-8596-0822","documentHash":"fdf8a59a-aa45-4a65-8a12-1676bc8eea31"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a04739966f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Bagnicka","uuid":"0D37A8BCF2F4D93F59FC1D87DBDADCE868EF14AFD99EBF96C877CC86963C73AE2E470CED6B83A3F731B3B08724BDCE11D9A8CE8A0CE7E36513995F6A5C4D000D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7193-2006","documentHash":"a42098e0-b6d5-4d75-b67b-2d9b112c9c92"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a0473927ee","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Płoneczka-Janeczko","uuid":"8D26F5ECE7C6FE0E212193D34FDC79212A28B20ACACB401D7DE5BB54E8EF7031E9A8A0EF6183A8C126A9D2C79F256196A838C0C6719D9D6E5D59AC48F8CFC195","orcidId":"0000-0002-7621-4449","documentHash":"cfd2d5d0-d31c-4f7a-803a-e57b47e043f1"},{"objectId":"5e709239878c28a047391f19","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Rypuła","uuid":"82E888157F268E11A9D73ADA116055388CA4AE6ED7530C4BC41FC4D789093BFAFB951E2BFA446F1802EF7491AB24378CAAC26A146AE053286D5FA70263E56CC7","orcidId":"0000-0003-3884-4834","documentHash":"82857c23-5562-4300-b5b8-808967bde737"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"625927b52467f037448199f3","doi":"10.3390/v14020311","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/2/311/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Lack of Fetal Protection against Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus in a Vaccinated Heifer","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the report was to present the circulation of BVDV (bovine viral diarrhea virus) in the cattle population and determine the cause of the failure of vaccination failure leading to the birth of the PI (persistently infected) calf. The case study was carried out at the BVDV-free animal breeding center and cattle farm, where the vaccination program against BVDV was implemented in 2012, and each newly introduced animal was serologically and virologically tested for BVDV. In this case, a blood sample was taken from a 9-month-old breeding bull. Positive RT-PCR and negative ELISA serology results were obtained. The tests were repeated at 2-week intervals, and the results confirmed the presence of the virus and the absence of specific antibodies, i.e., persistent infection. Additionally, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed, and the BVDV-1d subgenotype was detected. The results of this study showed that pregnant heifers and cows that are vaccinated multiple times with the killed vaccine containing BVDV-1a may not be fully protected against infection with other subgenotypes of BVDV, including their fetuses, which can become PI calves."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["662a3da540970762633a57e0","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5eb","5e709241878c28a0473927ee","5e709239878c28a047391f19"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929f878c28a04739966f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"1-9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5eb","5e709241878c28a0473927ee","5e709239878c28a047391f19","662a3da540970762633a57de","5e70929f878c28a04739966f","662a3da540970762633a57e0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a80","mniswId":"20156","title":"Viruses","issn":"1999-4915","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"7ad9ba09-e398-4059-b4b5-0a7a8c6e09d3"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["BVDV","persistently infected","vaccination"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747779467981"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63afb4c9409707109be18623","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Gunnarsson","documentHash":"230a18f9-bcae-40c5-9d4a-8f08e2e1a995"},{"objectId":"63afb4c9409707109be18622","name":"Anja Brinch","lastName":"Riber","documentHash":"eefbf85b-7be3-4ab5-9762-bf942610baa7"},{"objectId":"60c334699543c723365440d7","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Sztandarski","uuid":"DB121ECB1867DCEE6DCDFE72BBFCB495A3B8319D29FC1110A9E66DA325C15BD3E61BC3DA535901104DB03EB52A2F9FAB2EC0DA3171D22CA03C987336A1169A15","orcidId":"0000-0003-1304-6780","documentHash":"d8d49d3c-0d8c-4213-a679-29abd438b564"},{"objectId":"5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Marchewka","uuid":"EC0F04392DD656A21DC052B59B1A2D8E5A03749BA0461B4AFF6E8CCF5C15DE33EA901A402324204CF8155923E33B80BE4DC420B7AA2054A864B93FC416AA4F24","orcidId":"0000-0002-9571-8677","documentHash":"77dd006d-9494-445c-b9e3-36c4addbec89"},{"objectId":"5e709483878c28a0473becbe","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Konieczka","uuid":"8EABCC2EFDE8C5F924F284A0F3A7BAEA9A366A5DF2F1D3EDABD7B26FC32628CEB32B230A9EEEB4520D4E93B3F0C76E38836BB1BE44A1EF3B4022642535AFB7AB","orcidId":"0000-0002-2054-5636","documentHash":"ae2ba6bc-58d8-4eac-8b8b-4c82684eee7d"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc092","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Damaziak","uuid":"0C671D8D8F846EFC78895109024F2C4A56D5CADF242B40E1A686DD7CF463622B6CA5101B4BAB885E498A6B6A3FC0BDEE42B86F72555F9327F4D5B4259CD9BF89","orcidId":"0000-0001-5940-266X","documentHash":"b0f72f45-c0e3-4ac6-a1e5-77bd9e5e752e"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7ce9","name":"Żaneta","lastName":"Zdanowska-Sąsiadek","uuid":"D7E27058B96EA2C03154818663BDF5A496B6FA4F1DAF1E633BFA8DF1FE968619F0A398F1B424856547EB5F730747382F8ED41F90AD8DE76D0A642A3A921667EF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2593-8479","documentHash":"2efd1674-0fee-43b3-8411-455363561000"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399193","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Horbańczuk","uuid":"976205AE9A3DD4FA85531EB44854AE0083FBAD6743C6797D800A9669BD6FAED38693031A6C16E0A03AAE6903DEB2CEF4B47FFF137CB5399DCB5BFBCFCFF25343","orcidId":"0000-0002-7561-0941","documentHash":"a9235661-fb2e-4102-b6a6-35060d6414c3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62f4ceee40970737355c219b","doi":"10.1016/j.psj.2022.102039","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579122003303","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Gut microbiota activity in chickens from two genetic lines and with outdoor-preferring, moderate-preferring, and indoor-preferring ranging profiles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Despite the existing research into the gut microbiome of meat chickens, the associations between gut microbiome composition, its activity and chicken outdoor ranging frequency remain unexplored. The aim of this study was to determine the gut microbiota composition, activity and metabolic products in chickens of 2 different lines and 3 ranging profiles. Sixty non-beak trimmed birds, either Sasso or Green-legged Partridge were housed with access to outdoor ranges from wk. 5 to 10 of age. Outdoor ranges were video recorded to obtain frequencies of the birds’ range use. The information about relative abundance of selected bacterial groups in the ceca including Lactobacillus spp., E. coli, Bifidobacterium spp., and Clostridium spp. was obtained with the PCR method. Gut microbiota activity was assessed based on the glycolytic activity of bacterial enzymes including, α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, and β-glucuronidase as well as based on the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the caecal digesta. Statistical analysis was conducted by generalized linear mixed models, applying the breed and ranging profile as fixed effects and pen as a random factor. The lowest relative abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. was found in the cecal content of indoor-preferring Sasso birds (0.01 ± 0.001), as compared to all other birds in the experiment (ranging from 0.03 ± 0.01 to 0.11 ± 0.07; P = 0.0002). The lowest relative abundance of E. coli was identified for all outdoor-preferring birds and indoor- preferring Sasso birds (0.01 ± 0.001; P = 0.0087). Cecal activity of: α-glucosidase, β-glucuronidase and β-galactosidase was higher in Green-legged Partridges, as compared to Sasso (P = 0.013; P = 0.008; P = 0.004).

This study tested the hypothesis that a period of captivity during the juvenile period and human-controlled reproduction may potentially be involved in the disruption of the development of incestuous mating avoidance behavior in sanctuary-reintroduced male Konik polski horses. Between 1986 and 2000, cases of incestuous behavior in harem stallions born and reared until weaning in the sanctuary were studied. Eight males lived in the sanctuary's feral herd for the rest of their lives (the non-captive group; nC). They gained their own harem of mares without human intervention (no human-controlled reproductive activity, nHC). Another five stallions were removed as weanlings, reared in captivity and then reintroduced as adults (captive, C). Three of these C stallions were used as in-hand breeding stallions, one as a “teaser” (human-controlled reproductive activity, HC) and one was not used for reproduction in captivity (nHC). Reproductive records for 46 mares, daughters of all 13 harem stallions, were scrutinized and cases of incestuous breeding were recorded by interrogation of foal parentage records. C stallions failed to expel more daughters than nC stallions (33% vs. 18%, P = 0.045), and mated with significantly more of them (28% vs. 11%, P = 0.025). Interestingly, HC stallions expelled fewer (60%) and successfully mated with more (33%) daughters that nHC stallions (84% expelled, P = 0.013, and 10% successful mating with daughters, P = 0.010). All HC stallions bred incestuously at least once.\n\nWe propose that human intervention during a critical period of development of social and reproductive behavior in young stallions, by enforced separation from their natal herd and in-hand breeding, may contribute to their later aberrant behavior and disruption of inbreeding avoidance mechanisms in these stallions. The previous occurrence of human-controlled breeding may be one of the factors promoting incestuous behavior of stallions in natural conditions. The uninterrupted presence of stallions in their harems and herd member recognition may also play important roles in inbreeding avoidance in horses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a047399792"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fc6c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b3878c28a0473af64a","5e7093b2878c28a0473af55c","5e70945e878c28a0473bb92a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"180","pagesFromTo":"82-86","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a1878c28a047399792","5e70945e878c28a0473bb92a","5e7093b3878c28a0473af64a","5e709217878c28a04738fc6c","61d2d3752467f0718b04ad7d","5e7093b2878c28a0473af55c","61d2d3752467f0718b04ad7f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479934","mniswId":"19490","title":"Theriogenology","issn":"0093-691X","eissn":"1879-3231","documentHash":"5a895e76-bf91-415f-9ad3-e560a5ae5bdf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d2d3752467f0718b04ad81","year":"2022","volume":"180","documentHash":"890d3d2c-5445-44f9-9947-975a828b9e64"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Feral horse","Incest","Reproductive behavior","Inbreeding avoidance","Koniks"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747779468019"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6819e4a1fdbe8364f519c365","name":"Beata","lastName":"Burzynska","documentHash":"c1ebb8b5-b193-4dc9-81ae-d8d93d64f5d9"},{"objectId":"6819b946fdbe8359b32e36f1","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Pierzchala-Koziec","documentHash":"aa1c1618-89c0-4f61-8234-613d84e45821"},{"objectId":"6819b946fdbe8359b32e36f0","name":"Roksana","lastName":"Iwanicka-Nowicka","documentHash":"8dc22080-1588-42c5-afc2-2c680a3bfd4a"},{"objectId":"6819b946fdbe8359b32e36ee","name":"Monika","lastName":"Gora","documentHash":"99c6f79a-f49d-40a0-a6db-5f6eeaf14edc"},{"objectId":"6819b946fdbe8359b32e36ed","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Goscik","documentHash":"27baddad-13fb-4996-b844-5e9befe3af9b"},{"objectId":"634e0faa7523402e34134875","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kobrzycka","uuid":"B9D30E245ADD7269FF09F1DC70801E580338753595B46222CB7E7393C1519DB56FFBA0F67547C65631A9AE2F2D4948AD3049C4A9F54625136A07F3A7B133297D","documentHash":"51e94648-f7da-4462-b2e4-f71da12729cd"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c02a5","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Stankiewicz","uuid":"2DECC35439ECF87D059D42D92296066E05C0AA8DE7B8FFD4F09DA8B0E0A253149F6136C34EA33D1CACE7ED7C3F7B831E38C27543932B195CB25E4D00CA1D9854","orcidId":"0000-0002-2719-6205","documentHash":"c3212fb5-ce3c-4e8e-a524-18b6b2434a50"},{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa777","name":"Marek","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"CB94691AF7CB1183A1061167E5C440C78BF73E47FDC5BF0D36D696040443479354FF7FC37A620C1ADE0B5D47568164FBE600ABE41DDAF7D9BFD26039C8B877A7","orcidId":"0000-0002-0862-8076","documentHash":"86f0e8e5-3d8e-4d8c-a33d-d492edc4883d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62d8076a409707188cab8c97","doi":"10.3389/fnbeh.2022.869526","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2022.869526","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Hypothalamic Neurochemical Changes in Long-Term Recovered Bilateral Subdiaphragmatic Vagotomized Rats.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Vagus nerve is one of the crucial routes in communication between the immune and central nervous systems.

vagotomized rats, 1 month after surgery.\nResults: Our results show that, in the long term, vagotomy affects hypothalamic amino acids concentration but not mRNA expression of tested genes.\nDiscussion: We propose an alternative pathway of immune to CNS communication after vagotomy, leading to activation of the HPA axis, by influencing central amino acids and subsequent monoaminergic neurotransmission."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df62","uid":"bsq32O8WjxMhkpQii6EvcZw","uuid":"6700d816-d124-4a54-9d44-4f1b7f01494b","name":"Wydział Biologii i Ochrony

of the study was to identify differences in the expression of splice variants of the PRMT2, LTF and C4A genes in the mammary glands of healthy dairy cows and those infected with staphylococci. An expression study was conducted on 38 Polish Holstein-Friesian dairy cows who were removed from the herd owing to subclinical and chronic mastitic or reproductive issues. Two days before slaughter, milk samples were taken for microbiological analysis and examined for the presence of bacteria. The mammary gland parenchyma samples with a predominance of secretory tissue were taken; these were divided into three groups according to the health status of the mammary gland: H (without pathogenic bacteria in milk), CoNS (with coagulase-negative staphylococci in milk), and CoPS (with coagulasepositive staphylococci in milk). Two of the investigated genes, LTF and C4A, demonstrated variants unequivocally expressed in infected tissue. Two LTF gene variants were found to be associated with cow health status, and with the type of bacteria causing mastitis (CoPS\nor CoNS). In addition, the expression of C4A isoforms differed with regard to mastitis etiology groups. The comprehensive evaluation of PRMT2 transcript suggested that the gene may also be involved in course of mastitis: two of four PRMT2 transcripts showed increased expression in the mammary gland of the CoPS group compared to controls. The obtained results are important for the knowledge on the etiology of bovine mastitis. The effects of the identified mastitis-relevant splice variants need to be further explored on the protein level to verify the suitability of splice variants and recognize their contribution towards the disease phenotypes and course."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","uid":"biMkjldDwyEilXl7rx-ushQ","uuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","name":"Instytut Zootechniki - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739adb8","5e709409878c28a0473b5471","5e70940f878c28a0473b5983"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","parentUuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","rootUuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63da60af4097076b4a8dde83","5e70929f878c28a04739966f","5e7092a8878c28a04739a0c2","5e7092a1878c28a047399894","5e709489878c28a0473bf236"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"903-913","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709409878c28a0473b5471","5e70940f878c28a0473b5983","5e7092b1878c28a04739adb8","5e7092a8878c28a04739a0c2","63da60af4097076b4a8dde83","5e709489878c28a0473bf236","5e70929f878c28a04739966f","5e7092a1878c28a047399894"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547705d","mniswId":"1208","title":"Annals of Animal Science","issn":"1642-3402","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e9d5cce1-c361-423f-b07d-f938aa6a284b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6319d4064097073416d670e6","year":"2022","volume":"22","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"131a3742-de14-477f-bbdd-c9e26e22cb17"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["inflammation","lactoferrin","splice variants","staphylococci","milk production"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747779468223"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d1d91e4097071d34b9d81e","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Puchała","documentHash":"654ca33f-fd08-40e4-a1f2-79db7b1d5fa0"},{"objectId":"63d1d91e4097071d34b9d81d","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Markowska-Daniel","documentHash":"3e65d134-f670-4d85-a45c-d62e32c4eccf"},{"objectId":"63d1d91e4097071d34b9d81c","name":"Lucjan","lastName":"Witkowski","documentHash":"12e3ae0d-4206-4c54-92b1-a47375f4f74b"},{"objectId":"63d1d91e4097071d34b9d81b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Czopowicz","documentHash":"a4c0547d-4caf-4922-bfc9-49d9b80ebf2e"},{"objectId":"63d1d91e4097071d34b9d81a","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Kaba","documentHash":"0b79a489-e873-48b1-96d1-206df2b230b5"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abe4b","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Mickiewicz","uuid":"D7228D0AD9CD61072008F17DB7AC021B3716A893C2C4BD9525934E0B59DCD39991F7A860AA39E7C4C99F39863995E167B1F6F9946E617F146AA5770D946D4B10","orcidId":"0000-0001-9747-6803","documentHash":"8c5c15de-c414-4ff6-906b-0c4c25ca5cc1"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a04739966f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Bagnicka","uuid":"0D37A8BCF2F4D93F59FC1D87DBDADCE868EF14AFD99EBF96C877CC86963C73AE2E470CED6B83A3F731B3B08724BDCE11D9A8CE8A0CE7E36513995F6A5C4D000D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7193-2006","documentHash":"a42098e0-b6d5-4d75-b67b-2d9b112c9c92"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a0473920cf","name":"Olga","lastName":"Szaluś-Jordanow","uuid":"17E0C2E907F83BE9A5EBDFD3E673036778FDDB294F8757BD18958138EAF5901F661CBD36D72D64A6AB7AEF74143CFA6D95A76A556B4BA82F55938028F549E63D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2532-3338","documentHash":"f0073e54-14b3-4f8b-8264-80992aea8b6f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-12-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63d1d91e4097071d34b9d819","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2022-0071","publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/jvetres-2022-0071","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Longitudinal study on seroreactivity of goats exposed to colostrum and milk of small ruminant lentivirus–infected dams","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction\nSmall ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) causes caprine arthritis-encephalitis in goats and maedi-visna disease in sheep. Transmission is via ingestion of colostrum and milk from infected dams or long-term direct contact between animals. Lifelong seroconversion can occur several weeks after infection via ingestion. However, sub-yearling lambs that ingest contaminated colostrum may be able to clear the infection and become seronegative. Whether a similar phenomenon occurs in goats remains unknown. Therefore, the serological status of goats was studied longitudinally from the moment of natural exposure to colostrum and milk of SRLV-positive dams through the age of 24 months.\nMaterial and Methods\nBetween February 2014 and March 2017 a dairy goat herd was studied which had been infected with SRLV for more than 20 years and carried maedi-visna virus-like genotype A subtype A17. Thirty-one kids born to dams seropositive for SRLV for at least a year beforehand were followed. They ingested colostrum immediately after birth and then remained with their dams for three weeks. The goats were tested serologically every month using two commercial ELISAs. The clinical condition of the goats was also regularly assessed.\nResults\nOut of 31 goats, 13 (42%) seroconverted at the age ranging from 3 to 22 months with a median of 5 months. Two goats seroconverted in the second year of life. The other eleven did so before the age of one year; two of these reverted to seronegative status. Only 9 out of 31 goats (29%) seroconverted in the first year of life and remained seropositive. They were early and stable seroreactors to which SRLV was transmitted lactogenically. The age at which they seroconverted ranged from 3 to 10 months with a median of 5 months. In 8 of the 18 persistently seronegative goats, a single isolated positive result occurred. No goats showed any clinical signs of arthritis. The level of maternal antibodies at the age of one week did not differ significantly between the stable seroreactors and the remainder.\nConclusion\nSeroconversion appears to occur in less than 50% of goats exposed to heterologous SRLV genotype A via ingestion of colostrum and milk from infected dams and is delayed by 3–10 months. The natural lactogenic route of transmission of SRLV genotype A in goats appears to be less effective than this route of genotype B transmission reported in earlier studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929f878c28a04739966f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"511-521","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d1d91e4097071d34b9d81a","63d1d91e4097071d34b9d81b","63d1d91e4097071d34b9d81c","5e70923a878c28a0473920cf","5e709386878c28a0473abe4b","63d1d91e4097071d34b9d81d","63d1d91e4097071d34b9d81e","5e70929f878c28a04739966f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research (Poland)","issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-8608","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5a3ef30a-e992-42a0-a40a-ad7662219310"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["caprine arthritis-encephalitis","colostral antibodies","humoral immunity","maternal antibodies","seroconversion"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747779468271"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6659a0534097072ea48c4e8b","name":"Pavel","lastName":"Uhrin","documentHash":"1397881b-9054-4125-a6ca-340a359bca36"},{"objectId":"66599fc64097072ea48c486f","name":"Barbora","lastName":"Belakova","documentHash":"5566841d-2566-4510-8baa-1f77fef0d16c"},{"objectId":"66599f824097072ea48c4535","name":"Nikolay T.","lastName":"Tzvetkov","documentHash":"9ae28afd-35c3-4a9f-81b8-b4ca6ee1921b"},{"objectId":"66599f4d4097072ea48c41bb","name":"Kiril","lastName":"Kirilov","documentHash":"1ae20f51-1cd1-4268-9047-8f7825255559"},{"objectId":"66599f384097072ea48c411f","name":"Bhupinder","lastName":"Kapoor","documentHash":"0abf991e-568f-4b48-aa26-879aa0d05ae8"},{"objectId":"66599f1e4097072ea48c2c2d","name":"Chandragiri Siva","lastName":"Sai","documentHash":"5f381a49-d6bc-41d5-95c8-7a1e09a630cd"},{"objectId":"66599ed24097072ea48c27f9","name":"Merisa","lastName":"Cenanovic","documentHash":"9e1abb6a-4963-41b5-80fe-a4ba9c86e7ff"},{"objectId":"66599eac4097072ea48c25e6","name":"Ronita","lastName":"De","documentHash":"a3e1daa1-a13b-4f1f-ade6-529ef8303b0b"},{"objectId":"66599e904097072ea48c2446","name":"Reni E.","lastName":"Kalfin","documentHash":"5cf34445-6f6a-4e0d-ad99-1c85613efa99"},{"objectId":"66599e714097072ea48c2333","name":"Mladen","lastName":"Brncić","documentHash":"b912ea75-ab22-4946-94f5-042258bd5c6b"},{"objectId":"66599e454097072ea48c1f81","name":"Ren-You","lastName":"Gan","documentHash":"853d06cb-de89-46e4-94cb-69a21fc8c2a1"},{"objectId":"66599dd64097072ea48c1e60","name":"Javier","lastName":"Echeverria","documentHash":"e16fe56b-17af-417e-9fdc-df8c12d8024f"},{"objectId":"66599db24097072ea48c1d38","name":"Md.

POU Domain Mutations Found in Japanese Liver Cancer Patients Cause Downregulation of HNF4A Promoter Activity with Possible Disruption in Transcription Networks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A) is the master regulator of liver homeostasis and organogenesis and regulates many aspects of hepatocyte functions. It acts as a tumor suppressor in the liver, evidenced by the increased proliferation in HNF1A knockout (KO) hepatocytes. Hence, we postulated that any loss-of-function variation in the gene structure or composition (mutation) could trigger dysfunction, including disrupted transcriptional networks in liver cells. From the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) database of cancer genomes, we identified several HNF1A mutations located in the functional Pit-Oct-Unc (POU) domain. In our biochemical analysis, we found that the HNF1A POU-domain mutations Y122C, R229Q and V259F suppressed HNF4A promoter activity and disrupted the binding of HNF1A to its target HNF4A promoter without any effect on the nuclear localization. Our results suggest that the decreased transcriptional activity of HNF1A mutants is due to impaired DNA binding. Through structural simulation analysis, we found that a V259F mutation was likely to affect DNA interaction by inducing large conformational changes in the N-terminal region of HNF1A. The results suggest that POU-domain mutations of HNF1A downregulate HNF4A gene expression. Therefore, to mimic the HNF1A mutation phenotype in transcription networks, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of HNF4A. Through RNA-Seq data analysis for the HNF4A KD, we found 748 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 311 genes were downregulated (e.g., HNF1A, ApoB and SOAT2) and 437 genes were upregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) mapping revealed that the DEGs were involved in several signaling pathways (e.g., lipid and cholesterol metabolic pathways). Protein-protein network analysis suggested that the downregulated genes were related to lipid and cholesterol metabolism pathways, which are implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Our study demonstrates that mutations of HNF1A in the POU domain result in the downregulation of HNF1A target genes, including HNF4A, and this may trigger HCC development through the disruption of HNF4A-HNF1A transcriptional networks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c5878c28a0473c35de","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1abd","5e7093bb878c28a0473afeab","6462eaab40e3ff38f8b6b4d2","5e7094af878c28a0473c1ab9","646dbc854097077040480d5e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"413","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646dbc854097077040480d5e","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1abd","646dbc854097077040480d5f","646dbc854097077040480d60","646dbc854097077040480d61","5e7093bb878c28a0473afeab","5e7094c5878c28a0473c35de","6462eaab40e3ff38f8b6b4d2","5e7094af878c28a0473c1ab9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477dc4","mniswId":"7014","title":"Genes","issn":"2073-4425","eissn":"2073-4425","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"56f20fcc-0115-4eb8-abc9-6ae7a75aef55"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63aac2de40970732a0a18ba7","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"3","documentHash":"27a052f4-4b6c-455f-a1c7-1ab36081ad34"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["HNF1A","HNF4A","POU domain","hepatocellular carcinoma","mutation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747779468388"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646c9e97409707691c505720","name":"Damian","lastName":"Matak","documentHash":"69b6f6cc-d234-417e-8b17-e25e675e4be6"},{"objectId":"646c9e97409707691c50571f","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Wierzchowska","documentHash":"b659fde0-7dd0-4758-87f1-ef1554298800"},{"objectId":"646c9e97409707691c50571e","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Krakowiak","documentHash":"d9cda148-8756-4e1f-9bb4-25ac001e2e48"},{"objectId":"646c9e97409707691c50571d","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Gromadka","documentHash":"71d63d3c-8292-40de-a3cd-ee8b2b9430b2"},{"objectId":"646c9e97409707691c50571c","name":"Pawel","lastName":"Szymanski","documentHash":"94398b88-ca4f-46df-a801-204a8daebcef"},{"objectId":"646c9e97409707691c50571b","name":"Monika","lastName":"Dropik","documentHash":"586586b8-498e-42de-babe-3fab497d26ea"},{"objectId":"646c9e97409707691c50571a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wiatrowska","documentHash":"c4ff973f-143b-440d-8d81-ddd66dba13e7"},{"objectId":"646c9e97409707691c505719","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Golaszewska","documentHash":"913ecad9-ce4a-4330-a4c3-f67559121670"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"92D7C04F8AB3A7BAFDD427A486DDA8E51BB9EF910CE1748A4A41C1B5DD9D2FBC73939751C42B68AF9AB4431CFBC5570C935A57B7BE63B7045AA234AF1888672B","documentHash":"da59b83b-fda3-4817-8136-ba0e1298aa2f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646c9e97409707691c505716","doi":"10.1186/s40824-022-00258-6","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40824-022-00258-6.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"ISO 10993 biological evaluation of novel hemostatic powder – 4SEAL®","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Hemostasis plays a crucial role during every surgery allowing for a bloodless operating field. Fast and effective surgery leads to a reduced risk of postoperative complications. One of the latest methods for achieving homeostasis is using natural polysaccharide-based hemostatic powders.

Despite numerous publications on these raw materials or their active substances, their mechanism of action in various pathological states has not been recognized yet, nor has the safety of their simultaneous use been evaluated. The study aimed to assess how dietary supplementation with either PSO, with BME, or both, affects fatty acids’ profiles and their metabolism in hepatic microsomes, as well as the activity of selected microsomal enzymes (COX-2 and CYP1B1). Experimental animals (Sprague-Dawley rats) were divided into eight parallel experimental groups, differing in applied dietary modifications (control, PSO, BME and both PSO and BME) and introduction of chemical carcinogen—7,12-dimethylbenz[a]nthracene. Obtained results indicated the pronounced effect of the cancerous process on lipid metabolism and demonstrated the antagonistic effect of applied dietary supplements on the content of individual fatty acids and the activity of CYP1B1 and COX-2. The applied broad analytical approach and chemometric data analysis confirmed that raw materials, for which potential cancer prevention has been previously demonstrated, may differ in effects depending on the coexisting pathological state."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea4","uid":"bdue8IYFHJjfPMqPlXSYxbA","uuid":"30312732-6777-4ca9-84e6-ad3f07bc18c2","name":"Instytut Fizjologii i Żywienia Zwierząt im.

More than 1100 types of carotenoids are found naturally, out of which only around 50 are absorbed and metabolized in human body. Lycopene is one of the most commonly ingested members of fat-soluble carotenoid family that gives vegetables and fruits their red, yellow, or orange color. Lycopene has established itself as a promising therapy for AD owing to its neuroprotective activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiamyloidogenic properties. In this review, we highlight the various in vitro and preclinical studies demonstrating the neuroprotective effect of lycopene. Also, some epidemiological and interventional studies investigating the protective effect of lycopene in AD have been discussed. Diving deeper, we also discuss various significant mechanisms, through which lycopene exerts its remissive effects in AD. Finally, to overcome the issue of poor chemical stability and bioavailability of lycopene, some of the novel delivery systems developed for lycopene have also been briefly highlighted."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"49","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"208-227","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646ca115409707691c509262","646ca115409707691c509263","646ca115409707691c509264","646ca115409707691c509265","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","646ca115409707691c509266","646ca115409707691c509267","646ca115409707691c509268"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477331","mniswId":"2411","title":"BIOFACTORS","issn":"0951-6433","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"2995f3e1-fc63-4dbb-a17f-a1417345df1f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646ca115409707691c509261","year":"2022","volume":"49","number":"2","documentHash":"82d02eae-844a-4fc2-8f76-c530e9244a09"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Alzheimer's disease","lycopene","neuroinflammation","neuroprotective","oxidative stress"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747779468421"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6388936e40970777167c5070","name":"Marta","lastName":"Stelmasiak","documentHash":"5d42f94d-cc6a-4f22-a9ab-7dfd90dcd38d"},{"objectId":"6388936e40970777167c506f","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Lewicka","documentHash":"6e7d3366-0516-431d-a342-95eb42a57167"},{"objectId":"6388936e40970777167c506d","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Lieto","documentHash":"2d4ede03-a9fd-4801-807e-01b3c7af7ecf"},{"objectId":"5ed5cda37523404d1000e898","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Skopek","uuid":"0AE3B047D8E7BC1914123C976AF2B98EA7E2ACD71221339E8C330A680FA5A592C1CB541F5F6D900A300C91F783FE1B05BD6CED2CE9EACB5648A3AADA378CE528","orcidId":"0000-0002-8669-3359","documentHash":"179efcd0-da33-4a49-8ccf-9abd1184d7fa"},{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7b57","name":"Artur","lastName":"Zelent","uuid":"CE00BA5E249ADE8E21AB91CCA3B5C74221AD6C1CDA96BFC193212A8EFF1502AE0D6BC448AD14453FCA14C4B0EBB73D1E49A97FE100692C0E3B22F1B4EB2D728C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7968-9888","documentHash":"9c74bd28-fe98-4bcc-9ad8-a6da6ae1d62b"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a63","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Lewicki","uuid":"B90CF686103E1B1C6A43B2B48DF9445471E971741F9FEE62AD82AB04CF07C8D5E669352FED8A72279F83B28CEFE41F2B89D4E1A814514D3B03BD970250CE91BF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0539-0680","documentHash":"b3e5410d-c6e6-42f2-a407-b5005f052984"},{"objectId":"5e7093d0878c28a0473b12a6","name":"EMILIA","lastName":"KLIMASZEWSKA","uuid":"28BDA8E947C933D9A8E86914D591D33E2029B9B39C70B866FBFB52467A9F8B8931A3FBE900773C69061BF4E98E83100819CA5EDE7FF79613991E53D26D57AAC2","orcidId":"0000-0002-5621-5911","documentHash":"d35d61d8-4a5b-4d98-92c4-a4d0c8f48413"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"92D7C04F8AB3A7BAFDD427A486DDA8E51BB9EF910CE1748A4A41C1B5DD9D2FBC73939751C42B68AF9AB4431CFBC5570C935A57B7BE63B7045AA234AF1888672B","documentHash":"da59b83b-fda3-4817-8136-ba0e1298aa2f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6388936e40970777167c506c","doi":"10.3390/ijms23169158","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Looking into the Eyes—In Vitro Models for Ocular Research","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Animal research undoubtedly provides scientists with virtually unlimited data but inflicts pain and suffering on animals.

Even though this test was considered the gold standard for around 50 years, the Draize test fails to mimic human response mainly due to human and rabbit eye physiological differences. Therefore, many alternative assays were developed to evaluate ocular toxicity and drug effectiveness accurately.

The main purposes of this study were to estimate the current status of genetic diversity of the approved genetic resources (GRs) in indigenous Czech Red (CR) and Czech Spotted (CS) cattle and assess the impact of diversifying selection on two CR subpopulations based on genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. The main within-breed genetic diversity indicators of CR and CS (share of polymorphic SNPs, observed heterozygosity, and minor allele frequency) are intermediate or high, and the inbreeding coefficients are below zero. The small degree of genetic differentiation (maximum FST = 0.088) suggests a low divergence between the breeds and populations. Principal component analysis (PCA) shows a less genetic variation in CS and, in contrast, larger variability within and genetic similarity between the two analysed CR subpopulations. Putative selection signatures based on FST revealed that the ten most differentiated genomic regions between the two CR subpopulations were located on chromosomes 1, 3, 11, 12, 18, and 22, encompassing only 7 Mb of sequence and 69 protein-coding genes. Selection differences are low and probably attributed to the influence of the CS genome exploited in CR cattle revitalization. The majority of the candidate genes are involved in the immune system response, fertility, and neuronal and brain function. Gene Ontology enrichment and quantitative trait loci database analyses show that the genes act in milk and meat production and reproductive performance. These findings expand our knowledge about the genomic diversity of endangered Czech indigenous cattle and provide helpful information to organize their breeding programmes and preservation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"256","pagesFromTo":"104825","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646db5d1409707704047c77d","646db5d1409707704047c77e","646db5d1409707704047c77f","646db5d1409707704047c780","646db5d1409707704047c781","646db5d1409707704047c782","646db5d1409707704047c783","646db5d1409707704047c784","646db5d1409707704047c785","646db5d1409707704047c786","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d0f","mniswId":"13726","title":"Livestock Science","issn":"1871-1413","eissn":"1878-0490","documentHash":"02fff2c1-dbd2-4330-9520-3cd219e7025b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646db5d1409707704047c77c","year":"2022","volume":"256","documentHash":"de719ecc-266e-4d86-b69a-91155adf9bde"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Endangered native breed","Functional annotation","Genetic variability","Genomic difference","Preservation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747779468454"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67e12a81fdbe831b59802390","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Fichna","documentHash":"53e0943c-6b45-4bcd-a397-d4e2b02f4964"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b082a","name":"Agata","lastName":"Gurba","uuid":"28A7763319036B10E9BCF634775BE5ED4D3FE0DD6132726213BC8F70C08881BE8B289F12710B4C1B760C5DFDB1CDE9FD8F8A800425EE818C79BC532A68EC34AE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2874-8056","documentHash":"d1e21b06-a4c5-418c-ab0c-95f2ccd8d940"},{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a6941","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Taciak","uuid":"64E6F5F301C88E222B15929994C4AA581B7147C238B4CC7AACCA5F4078C0A2F75CB89BBD54F2261C0634CA6438B8AD4B808A2495EECB73928C2874189C8CB629","documentHash":"41616153-6e6d-4092-8476-0658c37f38d0"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a5433","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bujalska-Zadrożny","uuid":"3F24D7EB371C64C21C421A1BF8B0EF21F483219D5092F0F79C56921A9F4E3E146C7B09B9EF820DF16EFC7EB7D61D651AC0D1CFAAFF6CFE65B3E7D136C256622E","documentHash":"c070d99e-e556-4c28-962b-2ce464072e02"},{"objectId":"5e709333878c28a0473a4b40","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Młynarczuk-Biały","uuid":"E8003B50985E6249C20BAFF77C06DDA947ECC31147673D743A9D4AB78F5091033E47C98796CB0F112528F258FD4B960446B826AE01F37B4446B9D80529FD1107","orcidId":"0000-0002-5192-6415","documentHash":"6a04927b-33c9-456d-b363-55d2faf50448"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Sacharczuk","uuid":"8E2CFC97D0176907FD3FDCC1CB83621D26B1BE05F486A6134D990E8B18DF3BF8E8F3AADDCDC1D73F10233B59A74445730E291963FD429C8698BFDF373BA38AEF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6309-5292","documentHash":"fc3da1d3-82af-4442-a191-158025188e29"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"646c7828409707691c4d15e1","doi":"10.3390/ijms23020724","publicUri":"http://www.mdpi.com/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Gold (III) Derivatives in Colon Cancer Treatment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequently diagnosed cancer in men and the second in women. Standard patterns of antitumor therapy, including cisplatin, are ineffective due to their lack of specificity for tumor cells, development of drug resistance, and severe side effects. For this reason, new methods and strategies for CRC treatment are urgently needed. Current research includes novel platinum (Pt)- and other metal-based drugs such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), iridium (Ir), or ruthenium (Ru). Au(III) compounds are promising drug candidates for CRC treatment due to their structural similarity to Pt(II). Their advantage is their relatively good solubility in water, but their disadvantage is an unsatisfactory stability under physiological conditions. Due to these limitations, work is still underway to improve the formula of Au(III) complexes by combining with various types of ligands capable of stabilizing the Au(III) cation and preventing its reduction under physiological conditions. This review summarizes the achievements in the field of stable Au(III) complexes with potential cytotoxic activity restricted to cancer cells. Moreover, it has been shown that not nucleic acids but various protein structures such as thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) mediate the antitumor effects of Au derivatives. The state of the art of the in vivo studies so far conducted is also described."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"1-20","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e7093c5878c28a0473b082a","5e70934a878c28a0473a6941","5e709333878c28a0473a4b40","5e70933a878c28a0473a5433","67e12a81fdbe831b59802390"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gold","Au(III) complex","colorectal cancer","anticancer drugs","organometallic","cancer therapy","cytotoxicity","metallodrugs"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747779468482"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646f4921409707768b5dd5e3","name":"Jean-Loup","lastName":"Rault","documentHash":"176f25d3-8f28-4150-b715-d189201954fb"},{"objectId":"646f4921409707768b5dd5e2","name":"Tasha","lastName":"Cadman","documentHash":"4d36309f-935c-4bf9-b4e4-ea13d5bb8b34"},{"objectId":"646f4921409707768b5dd5e1","name":"Katharina","lastName":"Scheck","documentHash":"c38d91f4-7b61-462c-a380-97d7d2f4c597"},{"objectId":"5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","name":"Irene","lastName":"Camerlink","uuid":"63511C46590F3B7E26AA60526C552EED8D9F0549F8DEE5333E681582883DA44BB38FF69E2CB85D2955FD7C17DC6CFA4F35E7BE97ABD84CE52B2422233F186398","documentHash":"21f3e447-93d1-4634-92b3-8aae9343fdc4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646f4921409707768b5dd5e0","doi":"10.1016/j.applanim.2021.105540","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0168159121003270?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Lying in spatial proximity and active social behaviours capture different information when analysed at group level in indoor-housed pigs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Social preferences, and long-term social associations in the form of social bonds, are commonly assessed through observation of affiliative behaviour and spatial proximity between group members. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between active social behaviours and lying in proximity in indoor-housed pigs in order to evaluate their suitability as indicators of social preferences. Social behaviours were recorded by scan sampling over five weeks (75 scans per pig pre-weaning and 240 scans per pig post-weaning), and spatial proximity was recorded while pigs were lying (over six weeks; ≥10 observations per pig per week) with 23 groups pre-weaning and 12 groups post-weaning. At weaning, pigs were mixed with unfamiliar conspecifics, thus causing social instability, which was compared to the socially stable weeks pre-weaning and 3 weeks post-weaning. Behaviour and spatial proximity were statistically analysed at group level using mixed models, with as predictor variables observation week (age) and group size (8–15 pigs); and ambient temperature in the model for spatial proximity. Nose-to-nose contact (1.3% of scans), allogrooming (0.5%) and agonistic behaviour (1.4%) were observed infrequently, whereas ‘other non-agonistic social behaviour’ was observed in 8.2% of the scan samples. Nose-to-nose contact, agonistic behaviour and other non-agonistic social behaviour peaked in the week after regrouping (all p < 0.001). Allogrooming increased from the 3rd week of life until around 1% (of scans); and occurred more frequently in larger groups (p = 0.03). For spatial proximity, pigs were observed in 48.2% of the observations lying in full body contact, in 42.8% partly in body contact, and only in 9% of cases lying alone. They were lying in 57.8% of the cases head-to-head. Pigs were less frequently observed lying in full body contact and head-to-head at higher temperatures, while lying more in part body contact (p < 0.05); and at 7 weeks of age they were lying more at distance from each other than when younger (p < 0.001). Active social behaviours all significantly correlated with each other (r = 0.67–0.84) but did not correlate with lying in proximity or lying orientation. Various methods have been proposed by others to aggregate affiliative behaviour and spatial proximity into an index, but the biological relevance of this in indoor-housed pigs is questionable as active social behaviours and lying in proximity appear to capture different and uncorrelated information when analyzed at group level."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"246","pagesFromTo":"105540","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","646f4921409707768b5dd5e1","646f4921409707768b5dd5e2","646f4921409707768b5dd5e3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477110","mniswId":"1437","title":"APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE","issn":"0168-1591","eissn":"1872-9045","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3de7508a-a0a2-4ae7-b8f3-c5f835c11dde"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ad63fe40970728ba32340c","year":"2022","volume":"246","documentHash":"fa132315-9cfb-4802-a193-e904fc062d9e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Social behaviour","Allogrooming","Social bonds","Affiliation","Sociality index","Preferential association"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747779468490"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646dbad5409707704047fe9b","name":"Michael","lastName":"Schnürch","documentHash":"092f7c37-c82c-4c31-a5a3-80fb776be34a"},{"objectId":"646dbad5409707704047fe9a","name":"Verena M.","lastName":"Dirsch","documentHash":"76908f88-e176-4ec3-a0d0-e446ebddc426"},{"objectId":"646dbad5409707704047fe99","name":"Marko D.","lastName":"Mihovilovic","documentHash":"77da77b3-0d34-42ca-8990-91d774074a88"},{"objectId":"646dbad5409707704047fe98","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Schachner","documentHash":"2eedd7cc-3323-4c0a-b3c4-a97df1f70691"},{"objectId":"646dbad5409707704047fe97","name":"Scarlet","lastName":"Hummelbrunner","documentHash":"2e548644-b763-4557-832b-9e6db5f4424f"},{"objectId":"646dbad5409707704047fe96","name":"Sophie","lastName":"Geyrhofer","documentHash":"aed529b0-a374-4fd9-91f2-398abd7d47bc"},{"objectId":"646dbad5409707704047fe95","name":"Diyana","lastName":"Ogurlu","documentHash":"9257c70a-260a-4635-816f-f9ec5851f622"},{"objectId":"646dbad5409707704047fe94","name":"Eleni","lastName":"Papaplioura","documentHash":"4093dafa-20b8-4b43-a451-7f981c624f40"},{"objectId":"646dbad5409707704047fe93","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Linder","documentHash":"6c2e7a2e-f3d5-4fe2-ab71-1ef9fa666798"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646dbad5409707704047fe91","doi":"10.3390/biomedicines10010062","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/1/62/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Investigation of Leoligin Derivatives as NF-κΒ Inhibitory Agents","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The transcription factor NF-κB is an essential mediator of inflammation; thus, the identification of compounds that interfere with the NF-κB signaling pathway is an important topic.

Using our modular total synthesis method of leoligin, modifications at two positions were undertaken and the effects of these modifications on the biological activity were investigated. The first modification concerned the ester functionality, where it was found that variations in this position have a significant influence, with bulky esters lacking Michael-acceptor properties being favored. Additionally, the substituents on the aryl group in position 2 of the tetrahydrofuran scaffold can vary to some extent, where it was found that a 3,4-dimethoxy and a 4-fluoro substitution pattern show comparable inhibitory efficiency."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"62","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646dbad5409707704047fe93","646dbad5409707704047fe94","646dbad5409707704047fe95","646dbad5409707704047fe96","646dbad5409707704047fe97","646dbad5409707704047fe98","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","646dbad5409707704047fe99","646dbad5409707704047fe9a","646dbad5409707704047fe9b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bb72","mniswId":"2502","title":"Biomedicines","issn":"2227-9059","eissn":"2227-9059","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0606c349-3dc9-452c-99fd-bb4e4300270c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646dbad5409707704047fe92","year":"2021","volume":"10","number":"1","documentHash":"5c342fa4-30bc-42e7-825e-316f52dfdeb3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["NF-κB inhibition","inflammation","lignans","natural product synthesis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747779468522"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6630bfab4097071c38a707f6","name":"Alessandro","lastName":"Prigione","documentHash":"195f3bda-2ad0-4c40-8a04-bbff9da841ff"},{"objectId":"6630bfab4097071c38a707f5","name":"Josef","lastName":"Priller","documentHash":"e40b1f34-74cb-42e4-9224-a3ffdb07b922"},{"objectId":"6630bfab4097071c38a707f4","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Diecke","documentHash":"4a15cf3d-be2a-43eb-b54c-d483ba267519"},{"objectId":"6630bfab4097071c38a707f3","name":"Erich E.","lastName":"Wanker","documentHash":"2ab3398d-9f19-4a1f-a4bb-f0d13fef1092"},{"objectId":"6630bfab4097071c38a707f2","name":"Claas","lastName":"Ulrich","documentHash":"bfedb2a0-cfb5-42c8-bfba-21b9955984c1"},{"objectId":"6630bfab4097071c38a707f1","name":"Carolin","lastName":"Genehr","documentHash":"acd7615c-733f-4275-8d11-bdfbcd90ef0b"},{"objectId":"6630bfab4097071c38a707f0","name":"Miriam","lastName":"Bünning","documentHash":"43c177ef-db6b-4b7a-a6c5-6133134daa3d"},{"objectId":"6630bfab4097071c38a707ef","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Mlody","documentHash":"49f38961-2f04-4fb1-a072-a20ad3dcec55"},{"objectId":"6630bfab4097071c38a707ee","name":"Selene","lastName":"Lickfett","documentHash":"f96d2f2d-ed09-489e-bcf3-f516e08ebc8f"},{"objectId":"6630bfab4097071c38a707ed","name":"Duncan C.","lastName":"Miller","documentHash":"884c3733-23da-47b5-9193-72c9f5529af9"},{"objectId":"5e7092b0878c28a04739abad","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Lisowski","uuid":"28B515A985372713BCEF4B16FC54C00181E04448CBAF00EC703A81AEDCE112E772310F3D4545F83DFBCD0E886E9F08C66F2AF00EF052C8F198753BE1F7E01A7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3634-1072","documentHash":"bf6a35c7-926d-4db5-9470-f4ad44cbabd0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6630bfab4097071c38a707eb","doi":"10.1016/j.scr.2022.102976","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1873506122003257?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from three individuals with Huntington‘s disease","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by abnormal glutamine (Q) expansion in the huntingtin protein due to elongated CAG repeats in the gene HTT.

A functional in silico analysis of their target genes was also conducted. MiR-93-5p and miR-30e-5p were expressed only in BL, while miR-144 was expressed only in MSC, regardless of SRLV infection. In the SRLV-SP goats, higher miR-214-3p and miR-221-5p levels were found in the MSC than in the BL. Only miR-30e-5p was influenced by the lactation stage in BL in both groups, while only miR-93-5p was altered in BL of SRLV-SN goats. The target gene protein products exhibited contradictory functions, protecting the host from virus on the one hand and assisting viruses in their life cycle on the other. The differential expression of the miRNAs observed between the MSC and BL of SRLV-SP goats may suggest that the local immune response to the infection in the udder differs from the systemic response, and acts independently. Some miRNAs demonstrated different expression between lactation stages. It may be influenced by the metabolic burden occurring in early lactation and its peak.

With the use of the NGS technology, we sequenced 27 samples of mtDNA isolated from blood and tumours obtained from 13 dogs with mammary gland tumours. The total number of mutations and polymorphisms in the analysed mitochondrialgenomes was 557. We identified 383 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), 32 indels (or length polymorphisms), 4 mutations, 137 heteroplasmic positions and 1 indel muta-tion. The highest variability (132 changes) was observed in the variable number oftandem repeats (VNTR) region. The heteroplasmy rate in VNTR varied among individ-uals and even between two tumours in one organism. Our previous study resulted indetermination of a probable CpG island in this region, thus it is not excluded that thesechanges might alter mtDNA methylation.

Mice received intraplantar injections of 5% formalin and the intensity of nocifensive behaviours was scored. To assess the contribution of the endocannabinoid system, mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with rimonabant (0.3–3 mg/kg) prior to formalin. Minocycline (45 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to investigate microglial activation. The possible involvement of the endogenous opioid system was investigated with naloxone (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Cannabinoid receptor types 1 and 2 (Cnr1, Cnr2) and opioid receptor subtype (Oprm1, Oprd1, Oprk1) mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR in the structures of the central nociceptive circuit. Levels of anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) were measured by liquid chromatography coupled with the mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS). In the interphase, higher pain thresholds in the HA mice correlated with increased spinal anandamide and 2-AG release and higher Cnr1 transcription. Downregulation of Oprd1 and Oprm1 mRNA was noted in HA and LA mice, respectively, however no differences in naloxone sensitivity were observed in either line. As opposed to the LA mice, inflammatory pain sensitivity in the HA mice in the tonic phase was attributed to enhanced microglial activation, as evidenced by enhanced Aif1 and Il-1β mRNA levels. To conclude, Cnr1 inhibitory signaling is one mechanism responsible for decreased pain sensitivity in HA mice in the interphase, while increased microglial activation corresponds to decreased pain thresholds in the tonic inflammatory phase."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","67e11d0efdbe831b597edb69"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70933a878c28a0473a54c8","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e70933a878c28a0473a5433","5e70940b878c28a0473b552c","67e11d0efdbe831b597edb69","67e11d0efdbe831b597edb6a","67e11d0efdbe831b597edb6b","5e709422878c28a0473b6d30"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["anandamide","2-arachidonoylglycerol;","HA/LA mice","microglia","receptor expression"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747865978685"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646c7533409707691c4cf128","name":"Harald","lastName":"Willschke","documentHash":"801b8aa6-6e56-4199-86d5-8ab37e56dd29"},{"objectId":"646c7533409707691c4cf127","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kletecka-Pulker","documentHash":"72dc2f05-6362-4f54-9e19-98e855258d72"},{"objectId":"646c7533409707691c4cf126","name":"Eva","lastName":"Schaden","documentHash":"ea7b5c2f-1107-4260-91db-fdc6242f52d7"},{"objectId":"646c7533409707691c4cf125","name":"Sabine","lastName":"Völkl-Kernstock","documentHash":"17866e4c-c0c7-4d05-8d9d-becc53ab12d4"},{"objectId":"646c7533409707691c4cf124","name":"Faisal A","lastName":"Nawaz","documentHash":"6724c0fd-c348-4ab4-b1ce-6815540f2433"},{"objectId":"646c7533409707691c4cf123","name":"Emil D","lastName":"Parvanov","documentHash":"a51e063f-b9df-4083-8613-e29e3e020ae6"},{"objectId":"646c7533409707691c4cf122","name":"Christos","lastName":"Tsagkaris","documentHash":"516f6b76-bfe9-4842-a44d-902a68b4761e"},{"objectId":"646c7533409707691c4cf121","name":"Fabian","lastName":"Eibensteiner","documentHash":"bc5ab60a-c52d-4bf9-81a6-60fb7ee790e1"},{"objectId":"646c7533409707691c4cf120","name":"Elisabeth","lastName":"Klager","documentHash":"d7627723-bb8f-4c24-99fb-341d7a255a24"},{"objectId":"646c7533409707691c4cf11f","name":"Anela","lastName":"Tosevska","documentHash":"12ef67cf-a8ad-4831-84ba-739615ceb5c0"},{"objectId":"646c7533409707691c4cf11e","name":"Andy Wai Kan","lastName":"Yeung","documentHash":"f2c99eb4-7544-498b-b7f1-82dcc2b75158"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646c7533409707691c4cf11d","doi":"10.2196/28152","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/28152","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Medical and Health-Related Misinformation on Social Media: Bibliometric Study of the Scientific Literature","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Social media has been extensively used for the communication of health-related information and consecutively for the potential spread of medical misinformation. Conventional systematic reviews have been published on this topic to identify original articles and to summarize their methodological approaches and themes. A bibliometric study could complement their findings, for instance, by evaluating the geographical distribution of the publications and determining if they were well cited and disseminated in high-impact journals.\n\nObjective: The aim of this study was to perform a bibliometric analysis of the current literature to discover the prevalent trends and topics related to medical misinformation on social media.\n\nMethods: The Web of Science Core Collection electronic database was accessed to identify relevant papers with the following search string: ALL=(misinformati* OR \"wrong informati*\" OR disinformati* OR \"misleading informati*\" OR \"fake news*\") AND ALL=(medic* OR illness* OR disease* OR health* OR pharma* OR drug* OR therap*) AND ALL=(\"social media*\" OR Facebook* OR Twitter* OR Instagram* OR YouTube* OR Weibo* OR Whatsapp* OR Reddit* OR TikTok* OR WeChat*). Full records were exported to a bibliometric software, VOSviewer, to link bibliographic information with citation data. Term and keyword maps were created to illustrate recurring terms and keywords.\n\nResults: Based on an analysis of 529 papers on medical and health-related misinformation on social media, we found that the most popularly investigated social media platforms were Twitter (n=90), YouTube (n=67), and Facebook (n=57). Articles targeting these 3 platforms had higher citations per paper (>13.7) than articles covering other social media platforms (Instagram, Weibo, WhatsApp, Reddit, and WeChat; citations per paper <8.7). Moreover, social media platform-specific papers accounted for 44.1% (233/529) of all identified publications. Investigations on these platforms had different foci. Twitter-based research explored cyberchondria and hypochondriasis, YouTube-based research explored tobacco smoking, and Facebook-based research studied vaccine hesitancy related to autism. COVID-19 was a common topic investigated across all platforms. Overall, the United States contributed to half of all identified papers, and 80% of the top 10 most productive institutions were based in this country. The identified papers were mostly published in journals of the categories public environmental and occupational health, communication, health care sciences services, medical informatics, and medicine general internal, with the top journal being the Journal of Medical Internet Research.\n\nConclusions: There is a significant platform-specific topic preference for social media investigations on medical misinformation. With a large population of internet users from China, it may be reasonably expected that Weibo, WeChat, and TikTok (and its Chinese version Douyin) would be more investigated in future studies. Currently, these platforms present research gaps that leave their usage and information dissemination warranting further evaluation. Future studies should also include social platforms targeting non-English users to provide a wider global perspective."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"e28152","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646c7533409707691c4cf11e","646c7533409707691c4cf11f","646c7533409707691c4cf120","646c7533409707691c4cf121","646c7533409707691c4cf122","646c7533409707691c4cf123","646c7533409707691c4cf124","646c7533409707691c4cf125","646c7533409707691c4cf126","646c7533409707691c4cf127","646c7533409707691c4cf128","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478875","mniswId":"11826","title":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","issn":"1439-4456","eissn":"1438-8871","documentHash":"9d7080b4-460f-47e1-8a19-44e246a62f55"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61ec0eb42467f079a093a448","year":"2022","volume":"24","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"75dbda71-260f-4225-bcee-ff1f1251a8c2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","Twitter","bibliometric","dissemination","health","knowledge exchange","social media"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747865978722"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3de","name":"Kathrin C.","lastName":"Meyer","documentHash":"8f8daf2d-4701-46d4-ae01-ef9fca7fd7cc"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3dd","name":"Paul C.","lastName":"Marcogliese","documentHash":"ef157c3e-2a34-461a-ad3e-9612967a0867"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3dc","name":"Shibi","lastName":"Likhite","documentHash":"54c8428f-434a-495e-ae83-d3743ef17bbd"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3db","name":"Hugo J.","lastName":"Bellen","documentHash":"5c77e3fb-7c83-4dcb-9482-dea44b71331d"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3da","name":"Nicolas","lastName":"Wein","documentHash":"543f20e8-8aaa-4dcd-89b9-b03011c9d982"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3d9","name":"Marc","lastName":"Bickle","documentHash":"7a3e86a9-6205-4e00-a726-ca52381220de"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3d8","name":"Nikolaus","lastName":"Rajewsky","documentHash":"a93e1029-037d-41cb-b2bf-5f178c5a0ebb"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3d7","name":"Joseph R.","lastName":"Caporale","documentHash":"56054024-c223-414c-a0d9-1487e6d6a2da"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3d6","name":"Pipasha","lastName":"Biswas","documentHash":"a76a5ec9-d674-4fdd-88fe-8bf46a0882ca"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3d5","name":"Xiaojin","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"15750415-bc87-4eca-8521-a2656918a8f5"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3d4","name":"Petar","lastName":"Glažar","documentHash":"a7d0636d-5cbb-4514-865b-e88dbbf0a624"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3d3","name":"Florence","lastName":"Roussel","documentHash":"2813824b-2bce-45b8-98d6-9a8477c48476"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3d2","name":"Samantha","lastName":"Powers","documentHash":"328a5d09-ad93-4fa1-bc17-040cb143687d"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3d1","name":"Cassandra","lastName":"Dennys","documentHash":"a2a795fb-ee7d-4f6a-8ad2-a38d65080aba"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3d0","name":"Debdeep","lastName":"Dutta","documentHash":"31bab200-914e-412c-904b-fe45e685d0af"},{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3cf","name":"Shrestha","lastName":"Sinha Ray","documentHash":"af356a12-5ecf-43ae-9d40-6bf4da3d91f2"},{"objectId":"5e7092b0878c28a04739abad","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Lisowski","uuid":"28B515A985372713BCEF4B16FC54C00181E04448CBAF00EC703A81AEDCE112E772310F3D4545F83DFBCD0E886E9F08C66F2AF00EF052C8F198753BE1F7E01A7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3634-1072","documentHash":"bf6a35c7-926d-4db5-9470-f4ad44cbabd0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3cd","doi":"10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111751","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2211124722016345?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Mechanisms of IRF2BPL-related disorders and identification of a potential therapeutic strategy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The recently discovered neurological disorder NEDAMSS is caused by heterozygous truncations in the transcriptional regulator IRF2BPL. Here, we reprogram patient skin fibroblasts to astrocytes and neurons to study mechanisms of this newly described disease. While full-length IRF2BPL primarily localizes to the nucleus, truncated patient variants sequester the wild-type protein to the cytoplasm and cause aggregation. Moreover, patient astrocytes fail to support neuronal survival in coculture and exhibit aberrant mitochondria and respiratory dysfunction. Treatment with the small molecule copper ATSM (CuATSM) rescues neuronal survival and restores mitochondrial function. Importantly, the in vitro findings are recapitulated in vivo, where co-expression of full-length and truncated IRF2BPL in Drosophila results in cytoplasmic accumulation of full-length IRF2BPL. Moreover, flies harboring heterozygous truncations of the IRF2BPL ortholog (Pits) display progressive motor defects that are ameliorated by CuATSM treatment. Our findings provide insights into mechanisms involved in NEDAMSS and reveal a promising treatment for this severe disorder."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b0878c28a04739abad"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"41","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"111751","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6638d6644097076e57a9d3cf","6638d6644097076e57a9d3d0","6638d6644097076e57a9d3d1","6638d6644097076e57a9d3d2","6638d6644097076e57a9d3d3","6638d6644097076e57a9d3d4","6638d6644097076e57a9d3d5","6638d6644097076e57a9d3d6","6638d6644097076e57a9d3d7","6638d6644097076e57a9d3d8","6638d6644097076e57a9d3d9","6638d6644097076e57a9d3da","6638d6644097076e57a9d3db","6638d6644097076e57a9d3dc","6638d6644097076e57a9d3dd","6638d6644097076e57a9d3de","5e7092b0878c28a04739abad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477584","mniswId":"3378","title":"Cell Reports","issn":"2211-1247","eissn":"2211-1247","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"bd8d4ddd-3fd6-42ae-bee4-7a175dd10146"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6638d6644097076e57a9d3ce","year":"2022","volume":"41","number":"10","documentHash":"aa3b0a88-421f-45c3-be32-13e041c23b59"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["IRF2BPL","NEDAMSS","neurodegeneration","nonsense mutations","induced astrocytes","mislocalization","CuATSM","Drosophila","Pits","EAP1"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747865979054"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646c90ec409707691c4e7825","name":"Bairong","lastName":"Shen","documentHash":"2e7c4dbf-47e4-4450-942d-b79cb6f5b8a7"},{"objectId":"646c90ec409707691c4e7824","name":"Rajeev K.","lastName":"Singla","documentHash":"daad46c0-5f4c-47df-8658-6b9d553662a8"},{"objectId":"646c90ec409707691c4e7823","name":"Michael G.","lastName":"Head","documentHash":"d5cf763b-858c-4551-96c6-a25a8068ba2a"},{"objectId":"646c90ec409707691c4e7822","name":"Mohammad Yasir","lastName":"Essar","documentHash":"4d357754-6032-4a6c-9398-12215def04c7"},{"objectId":"646c90ec409707691c4e7821","name":"Goodluck","lastName":"Nchasi","documentHash":"16acae77-bd0a-49e4-a59e-cfac8895f383"},{"objectId":"646c90ec409707691c4e7820","name":"Kapil","lastName":"Narain","documentHash":"262b5452-375f-4e67-ad1a-2b17283d485a"},{"objectId":"646c90ec409707691c4e781f","name":"Faisal A.","lastName":"Nawaz","documentHash":"8d8b0ec2-6dda-4833-9802-0cf1c81e0006"},{"objectId":"646c90ec409707691c4e781e","name":"Farah","lastName":"Ennab","documentHash":"6f48d6f9-3f82-4e77-a273-2502d67132bd"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646c90ec409707691c4e781c","doi":"10.3389/ijph.2022.1605149","publicUri":"https://www.ssph-journal.org/articles/10.3389/ijph.2022.1605149/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Monkeypox Outbreaks in 2022: Battling Another “Pandemic” of Misinformation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Monkeypox is a virus that was formerly recognized as a rare zoonotic disease but has been noted as an emerging disease of concern where there are significant gaps in knowledge.

This suggests that inappropriate culture conditions might inhibit mitochondrial functions, and affect embryonic development. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine whether in vitro culture (IVC) might affect mitochondrial function, distribution, organization (by Mitotracker Green), gene expression on RNA level (by qPCR), and protein expression and localization (by western blot and immunostaining) involved in regulation of mitochondrial functions. Mitochondria in 2-cell IVC embryos were less numerous compare to IN VIVO while the localization and distribution do not differ between the groups. Mitochondria of in vivo blastocysts formed elongated network along the cells, while in IVC were fragmented, rounded, and aggregated mainly in the perinuclear region. Additionally, mitochondria of IN VIVO embryos moved back and forth along their long axis on radial tracks, while in IVC blastocysts were much less active. mtDNA copy number in IVC blastocysts (92,336.65 ± 5860.04) was significantly lower than that of IN VIVO (169,103.92 ± 16,322.41; P < 0.02) as well as lower protein expressions responsible for mitochondrial fusion was observed in IVC blastocysts.

Vaccination Against COVID-19: Twitter Poll Analysis on Public Health Opinion","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization Emergency Committee declared the rapid worldwide spread of COVID-19 a global health emergency. By December 2020, the safety and efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines had been demonstrated. However, international vaccination coverage rates have remained below expectations (in Europe at the time of manuscript submission). Controversial mandatory vaccination is currently being discussed and has already been introduced in some countries (Austria, Greece, and Italy). We used the Twitter survey system as a viable method to quickly and comprehensively gather international public health insights on mandatory vaccination against COVID-19.\n\nObjective: The purpose of this study was to better understand the public's perception of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination in real time using Twitter polls.\n\nMethods: Two Twitter polls were developed (in the English language) to seek the public's opinion on the possibility of mandatory vaccination. The polls were pinned to the Digital Health and Patient Safety Platform's (based in Vienna, Austria) Twitter timeline for 1 week in mid-November 2021, 3 days after the official public announcement of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination in Austria. Twitter users were asked to participate and retweet the polls to reach the largest possible audience.\n\nResults: Our Twitter polls revealed two extremes on the topic of mandatory vaccination against COVID-19. Almost half of the 2545 respondents (n=1246, 49%) favor mandatory vaccination, at least in certain areas. This attitude contrasts with the 45.7% (n=1162) who categorically reject mandatory vaccination. Over one-quarter (n=621, 26.3%) of participating Twitter users said they would never get vaccinated, as reflected by the current Western European and North American vaccination coverage rate. Concatenating interpretation of these two polls should be done cautiously as participating populations might substantially differ.\n\nConclusions: Mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 (in at least certain areas) is favored by less than 50%, whereas it is opposed by almost half of the surveyed Twitter users. Since (social) media strongly influences public perceptions and views, and social media discussions and surveys are specifically susceptible to the \"echo chamber effect,\" the results should be interpreted as a momentary snapshot. Therefore, the results of this study need to be complemented by long-term surveys to maintain their validity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"6","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"e35754","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646ddb2040970770404a165c","646ddb2040970770404a165d","646ddb2040970770404a165e","646ddb2040970770404a165f","646ddb2040970770404a1660","646ddb2040970770404a1661","646ddb2040970770404a1662","646ddb2040970770404a1663","646ddb2040970770404a1664","646ddb2040970770404a1665","646ddb2040970770404a1666","646ddb2040970770404a1667","646ddb2040970770404a1668","646ddb2040970770404a1669","646ddb2040970770404a166a","646ddb2040970770404a166b","646ddb2040970770404a166c","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","646ddb2040970770404a166d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850cc6a","mniswId":"29702","title":"JMIR Formative Research","eissn":"2561-326X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"dd68ce86-a6c0-4cc2-b42f-144a5b00d4d2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646ddb2040970770404a165b","year":"2022","volume":"6","number":"6","documentHash":"bbf55958-80f2-426c-b453-01c1bcb9db69"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2","Twitter","coronavirus","mandatory vaccination","poll","public health","questionnaire","social media","vaccine"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747865979213"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6399b9ee40970768cd0fa20c","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Mojzych","documentHash":"fc6666cc-0888-4852-8631-f6b1a2688bd1"},{"objectId":"6399b9ee40970768cd0fa20a","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Kuśmierz","documentHash":"d4f83bf1-055f-4754-a4ac-d8ed25e73a68"},{"objectId":"61e23fb87523403b69b37a94","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Wysocki","uuid":"31871A0208DBFEEB74DE3351A659435D14F59E22E25A8676DC41845E122A912389C55698F8B57DBFC1DD2A085068E2F32D6C1BED9A6AF63D68232B0FC97FA100","documentHash":"6ca918a5-c6bf-40c6-b472-961d70648859"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afba1","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"8D9917627886BA335B5840A01F0CC368619957C743E78E00B5A5F2D884EB076595DE2B5774D6B6B4ED3B4EDF373974A04C19EE1B580E5FF9F0190DDB8E019364","orcidId":"0000-0002-9197-5553","documentHash":"fac5a155-6cac-4174-b93e-3d1f79e33005"},{"objectId":"5e709243878c28a047392a2d","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Chotkowski","uuid":"6C36D463539B7173D955F53196B9F9F9E11214E3621072AD3B562CE440B88A5C10E00E69AA198AAAD3C2632778BA2D550EC231092B05D57CBFAD603DC7617006","orcidId":"0000-0001-7702-2572","documentHash":"1a43d3fd-7078-4465-b12d-3d454596a4be"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"6399b9ee40970768cd0fa208","doi":"10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c01950","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c01950","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Preparation of Surface-Supported Polylactide Spherical-Cap Particles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biodegradable polymer particles are of considerable importance due to their multiple applications in medical diagnostics and therapy. Spherical-cap particles have been prepared in a very general and simple method by melting a thin polymer film supported on a solid substrate that is in contact with a hydrophilic solvent. The melted polymer forms droplets which transform into solid particles attached to the surface after cooling down the sample. This approach has been demonstrated for polylactide adlayers on glass, which, when melted in glycerol, produce an array of polymer particles supported on the surface. The size of the particles depends on the experimental conditions and ranges from tens of nanometers to several micrometers. The particles can be employed to incorporate guest species, for example, drug molecules or inorganic nanoparticles. This has been confirmed herein through entrapment of an anticancer drug (doxorubicin) and radiogold (Au-198) nanoparticles. The resulting structures have been examined using a number of complementary physicochemical techniques including scanning and transmission electron microscopy, atomic force and optical microscopy as

association between elevated red cell distribution width (RDW) and poor prognosis in variety of diseases is unknown although many researchers consider RDW a marker of inflammation. We hypothesized that RDW directly affects intravascular hemodynamics, interactions between circulating cells and vessel wall, inducing local changes predisposing to atherothrombosis. We applied different human and animal models to verify our hypothesis. Carotid plaques harvested from patients with high RDW had increased expression of genes and proteins associated with accelerated atherosclerosis as compared to subjects with low RDW. In microfluidic channels samples of blood from high RDW subjects showed flow pattern facilitating direct interaction with vessel wall. Flow pattern was also dependent on RDW value in mouse carotid arteries analyzed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging. In different mouse models of elevated RDW accelerated development of atherosclerotic lesions in aortas was observed. Therefore, comprehensive biological, fluid physics and optics studies showed that variation of red blood cells size measured by RDW results in increased interactions between vascular wall and circulating morphotic elements which contribute to vascular pathology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70930c878c28a0473a1ca1","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e709422878c28a0473b6d30"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-14","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b9","5e70933e878c28a0473a5896","67e13fa2fdbe831b5981c9ef","67e13fa2fdbe831b5981c9f0","67e13fa2fdbe831b5981c9f3","67e13fa2fdbe831b5981c9f4","67e13fa2fdbe831b5981c9f5","67e13fa2fdbe831b5981c9f6","67e13fa2fdbe831b5981c9f7","67e13fa2fdbe831b5981c9f8","67e13fa2fdbe831b5981c9f9","67e13fa2fdbe831b5981c9fa","67e13fa2fdbe831b5981c9fb","67e13fa2fdbe831b5981c9fc","67e13fa2fdbe831b5981c9fd","5e709422878c28a0473b6d30","5e70930c878c28a0473a1ca1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"2045-2322","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Red Blood Cell Distribution Width","Anisocytosis","Vascular wall interactions","Atherothrombosis","Blood flow dynamics","Inflammation","Cardiovascular disease","Microfluidic channels"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747952392348"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce708","name":"Harald","lastName":"Willschke","documentHash":"f501ad06-8f05-4b2b-a578-2145dd59c7ff"},{"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce707","name":"Jan David","lastName":"Smeddinck","documentHash":"134379b2-0064-47ec-b279-0879ea853fc6"},{"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce706","name":"Josef","lastName":"Niebauer","documentHash":"639afb6e-e4d4-491c-addf-6e6676246e26"},{"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce705","name":"Isabel","lastName":"Höppchen","documentHash":"8f29a157-009f-41e4-a63e-6a477e822528"},{"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce704","name":"Johanna","lastName":"Gutenberg","documentHash":"45151c9a-90dd-4916-9d1f-881a4ea5ca0c"},{"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce703","name":"Rik","lastName":"Crutzen","documentHash":"42e8f074-0770-4ac0-96fc-5176b87592fa"},{"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce702","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kletecka-Pulker","documentHash":"7af6ef4a-db63-4285-966c-0c0318d72c76"},{"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce701","name":"Sabine","lastName":"Völkl-Kernstock","documentHash":"19d63d66-b07e-49b2-a117-4e61bef4ac49"},{"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce700","name":"Fabian","lastName":"Eibensteiner","documentHash":"6d1086bf-90b1-4ee7-b3ad-fe8aabb929a4"},{"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce6ff","name":"Anna","lastName":"Fassl","documentHash":"91c3cdfd-16f4-49d0-8dd7-c6590edbd607"},{"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce6fe","name":"Emil D","lastName":"Parvanov","documentHash":"2475f938-4bec-40ff-b2f4-3b73f44adc3a"},{"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce6fd","name":"Stefan Tino","lastName":"Kulnik","documentHash":"9410f302-0031-415c-8c54-aef17b7d1503"},{"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce6fc","name":"Andy Wai Kan","lastName":"Yeung","documentHash":"fa66a157-0dcb-45fc-b7f7-a661d8162fcf"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce6fa","doi":"10.2196/36086","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/36086","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Research on Digital Technology Use in Cardiology: Bibliometric Analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Digital technology uses in cardiology have become a popular research focus in recent years. However, there has been no published bibliometric report that analyzed the corresponding academic literature in order to derive key publishing trends and characteristics of this scientific area.\nObjective: We used a bibliometric approach to identify and analyze the academic literature on digital technology uses in cardiology, and to unveil popular research topics, key authors, institutions, countries, and journals. We further captured the cardiovascular conditions and diagnostic tools most commonly investigated within this field.\nMethods: The Web of Science electronic database was queried to identify relevant papers on digital technology uses in cardiology. Publication and citation data were acquired directly from the database. Complete bibliographic data were exported to VOSviewer, a dedicated bibliometric software package, and related to the semantic content of titles, abstracts, and keywords. A term map was constructed for findings visualization.\nResults: The analysis was based on data from 12,529 papers. Of the top 5 most productive institutions, 4 were based in the United States. The United States was the most productive country (4224/12,529, 33.7%), followed by United Kingdom (1136/12,529, 9.1%), Germany (1067/12,529, 8.5%), China (682/12,529, 5.4%), and Italy (622/12,529, 5.0%). Cardiovascular diseases that had been frequently investigated included hypertension (152/12,529, 1.2%), atrial fibrillation (122/12,529, 1.0%), atherosclerosis (116/12,529, 0.9%), heart failure (106/12,529, 0.8%), and arterial stiffness (80/12,529, 0.6%). Recurring modalities were electrocardiography (170/12,529, 1.4%), angiography (127/12,529, 1.0%), echocardiography (127/12,529, 1.0%), digital subtraction angiography (111/12,529, 0.9%), and photoplethysmography (80/12,529, 0.6%). For a literature subset on smartphone apps and wearable devices, the Journal of Medical Internet Research (20/632, 3.2%) and other JMIR portfolio journals (51/632, 8.0%) were the major publishing venues.\nConclusions: Digital technology uses in cardiology target physicians, patients, and the general public. Their functions range from assisting diagnosis, recording cardiovascular parameters, and patient education, to teaching laypersons about cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This field already has had a great impact in health care, and we anticipate continued growth."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"e36086","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646c7462409707691c4ce6fc","646c7462409707691c4ce6fd","646c7462409707691c4ce6fe","646c7462409707691c4ce6ff","646c7462409707691c4ce700","646c7462409707691c4ce701","646c7462409707691c4ce702","646c7462409707691c4ce703","646c7462409707691c4ce704","646c7462409707691c4ce705","646c7462409707691c4ce706","646c7462409707691c4ce707","646c7462409707691c4ce708","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478875","mniswId":"11826","title":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","issn":"1439-4456","eissn":"1438-8871","documentHash":"9d7080b4-460f-47e1-8a19-44e246a62f55"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646c7462409707691c4ce6fb","year":"2022","volume":"24","number":"5","documentHash":"8ca512fd-4be1-4716-82b9-0c22479c2863"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["atrial fibrillation","cardiac","cardiology","cardiopulmonary resuscitation","cardiovascular","electrocardiography","health application","hypertension","wearable device","digital health","mHealth"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747952392689"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646c7e24409707691c4d8629","name":"Christopher","lastName":"Wardell","documentHash":"7bb8945c-dc9a-4a47-b504-de53cc3e2cbd"},{"objectId":"5e7094c5878c28a0473c35de","name":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Taniguchi","uuid":"2A0CFA9A6B89CB3CEE777F6F29214022AA2419D8BBE1FF66B80CE36A84BCB2DAE93CEBE3F7258D0DD97DB84D6A83C7505E1F7080FBD9BCC6908DB71E44B02055","orcidId":"0000-0001-7270-390X","documentHash":"5b3a159e-86a4-4b30-accc-523bf3563bab"},{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1ab9","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Leszczyński","uuid":"F12BA66C0AA44E55114FA0C048719F3DB213D603E3E347123CA339FE27419E6F76021D2943B314B12D351901D2D7BF34D41454EC5B255F36F13F05F3A64EA04D","orcidId":"0000-0002-4794-248X","documentHash":"afa4bd4c-fbd2-4217-aaed-63c7e820d93e"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6d30","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Poznański","uuid":"38FE78B4628019145D73108935EDED3834E41F31B1A81F773BFE5457520B533751B667E57CF0488B0E3C3ACEF99BF8B2C6AB57BA0EC34C507C822C3FC1F61CAD","orcidId":"0000-0002-1321-2235","documentHash":"af5ac268-10af-472f-bf24-71dde7a241d6"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afeab","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Pierzchała","uuid":"B6A2D7789E13D203E2E915FF5425734EB014579E76ABB30A43AF618C47FD4A17C42DCE475CA59B2BA967596814D2CB409F900B85069A4FC95E78D7E6A0ED42A7","orcidId":"0000-0001-7001-1336","documentHash":"2da70898-1086-4509-a2be-569bad515bcc"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6625","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Śmiech","uuid":"5369F536B2A0FE2154FB09AA125AA1A8383420A59C09247C4D3E3BC6E40470AE00834253E996F4297C125190F5E5BF7D21F237B3C03BD22FEB42B50D020BA2B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-2355-049X","documentHash":"683e3172-d006-444b-b93e-584041e41e7d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646c7e24409707691c4d8626","doi":"10.3390/ijms23031548","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/3/1548/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Oncogenic Mutation BRAF V600E Changes Phenotypic Behavior of THLE-2 Liver Cells through Alteration of Gene Expression","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The accumulation of mutations in cancer driver genes, such as tumor suppressors or proto-oncogenes, affects cellular homeostasis. Disturbances in the mechanism controlling proliferation cause significant augmentation of cell growth and division due to the loss of sensitivity to the regulatory signals. Nowadays, an increasing number of cases of liver cancer are observed worldwide. Data provided by the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) have indicated many alterations within gene sequences, whose roles in tumor development are not well understood. A comprehensive analysis of liver cancer (virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma) samples has identified new and rare mutations in B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) in Japanese HCC patients, as well as BRAF V600E mutations in French HCC patients. However, their function in liver cancer has never been investigated. Here, using functional analysis and next generation sequencing, we demonstrate the tumorigenic effect of BRAF V600E on hepatocytes (THLE-2 cell line). Moreover, we identified genes such as BMP6, CXCL11, IL1B, TBX21, RSAD2, MMP10, and SERPIND1, which are possibly regulated by the BRAF V600E-mediated, mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway. Through several functional assays, we demonstrate that BRAF L537M, D594A, and E648G mutations alone are not pathogenic in liver cancer. The investigation of genome mutations and the determination of their impact on cellular processes and functions is crucial to unraveling the molecular mechanisms of liver cancer development."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c5878c28a0473c35de","5e709422878c28a0473b6d30","5e7093bb878c28a0473afeab","5e709347878c28a0473a6625","5e7094af878c28a0473c1ab9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1548","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646c7e24409707691c4d8629","5e709422878c28a0473b6d30","5e7093bb878c28a0473afeab","5e7094c5878c28a0473c35de","5e709347878c28a0473a6625","5e7094af878c28a0473c1ab9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fa5df02467f013ba91dd47","year":"2022","volume":"23","number":"3","documentHash":"777a1283-1b7b-4880-b166-d90fbed20095"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["BRAF mutation","MAPK/ERK","hepatocellular carcinoma","liver cancer"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747952392702"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646c8ae5409707691c4e3cfb","name":"Harald","lastName":"Willschke","documentHash":"7590ed22-ac47-402f-b8ea-aa9d4da1b2ce"},{"objectId":"646c8ae5409707691c4e3cfa","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kletecka-Pulker","documentHash":"2a790250-f0b6-49d1-98d6-572b4bc81f06"},{"objectId":"646c8ae5409707691c4e3cf9","name":"Mojca","lastName":"Hribersek","documentHash":"41fba006-c973-43b8-b1b4-b06b5a6bf892"},{"objectId":"646c8ae5409707691c4e3cf8","name":"Emil D.","lastName":"Parvanov","documentHash":"240302bd-2e12-43c9-8a09-071da52a8bac"},{"objectId":"646c8ae5409707691c4e3cf7","name":"Fabian","lastName":"Eibensteiner","documentHash":"fa208930-a692-4f1e-9dfb-18d987a42a8d"},{"objectId":"646c8ae5409707691c4e3cf6","name":"Elisabeth","lastName":"Klager","documentHash":"1e8e921c-6b8d-4386-a48f-b66971c65548"},{"objectId":"646c8ae5409707691c4e3cf5","name":"Romil","lastName":"Singh","documentHash":"4085b376-7c02-4f24-8ac0-f1305471e129"},{"objectId":"646c8ae5409707691c4e3cf4","name":"Christos","lastName":"Tsagkaris","documentHash":"f99225a4-1403-4e06-a784-1344ab360672"},{"objectId":"646c8ae5409707691c4e3cf3","name":"Monali Y.","lastName":"Desai","documentHash":"c792dd40-4481-45c1-8721-4b12fd0fc363"},{"objectId":"646c8ae5409707691c4e3cf2","name":"Austin A.","lastName":"Barr","documentHash":"ab29a1a7-55cd-40c8-957b-dcc78dc8f14a"},{"objectId":"646c8ae5409707691c4e3cf1","name":"Faisal A.","lastName":"Nawaz","documentHash":"cf5ec5b5-b34e-4305-84eb-6f3d1f423191"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646c8ae5409707691c4e3cf0","doi":"10.3389/fpubh.2022.856571","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.856571/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Promoting Research, Awareness, and Discussion on AI in Medicine Using #MedTwitterAI: A Longitudinal Twitter Hashtag Analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape medical practice and the delivery of healthcare. Online discussions surrounding AI's utility in these domains are increasingly emerging, likely due to considerable interest from healthcare practitioners, medical technology developers, and other relevant stakeholders. However, many practitioners and medical students report limited understanding and familiarity with AI.\nObjective: To promote research, events, and resources at the intersection of AI and medicine for the online medical community, we created a Twitter-based campaign using the hashtag #MedTwitterAI.\nMethods: In the present study, we analyze the use of #MedTwitterAI by tracking tweets containing this hashtag posted from 26th March, 2019 to 26th March, 2021, using the Symplur Signals hashtag analytics tool. The full text of all #MedTwitterAI tweets was also extracted and subjected to a natural language processing analysis.\nResults: Over this time period, we identified 7,441 tweets containing #MedTwitterAI, posted by 1,519 unique Twitter users which generated 59,455,569 impressions. The most common identifiable locations for users including this hashtag in tweets were the United States (378/1,519), the United Kingdom (80/1,519), Canada (65/1,519), India (46/1,519), Spain (29/1,519), France (24/1,519), Italy (16/1,519), Australia (16/1,519), Germany (16/1,519), and Brazil (15/1,519). Tweets were frequently enhanced with links (80.2%), mentions of other accounts (93.9%), and photos (56.6%). The five most abundant single words were AI (artificial intelligence), patients, medicine, data, and learning. Sentiment analysis revealed an overall majority of positive single word sentiments (e.g., intelligence, improve) with 230 positive and 172 negative sentiments with a total of 658 and 342 mentions of all positive and negative sentiments, respectively. Most frequently mentioned negative sentiments were cancer, risk, and bias. Most common bigrams identified by Markov chain depiction were related to analytical methods (e.g., label-free detection) and medical conditions/biological processes (e.g., rare circulating tumor cells).\nConclusion: These results demonstrate the generated considerable interest of using #MedTwitterAI for promoting relevant content and engaging a broad and geographically diverse audience. The use of hashtags in Twitter-based campaigns can be an effective tool to raise awareness of interdisciplinary fields and enable knowledge-sharing on a global scale."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej

illness (COVID-19) is an infectious pathology generated by intense severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This infectious disease has emerged in 2019. The COVID-19-associated pandemic has considerably affected the way of life and the economy in the world. It is consequently crucial to find solutions allowing remedying or alleviating the effects of this infectious disease. Natural products have been in perpetual application from immemorial time given that they are attested to be efficient towards several illnesses without major side effects. Various studies have shown that plant extracts or purified molecules have a promising inhibiting impact towards coronavirus. In addition, it is substantial to understand the characteristics, susceptibility and impact of diet on patients infected with COVID-19. In this review, we recapitulate the influence of extracts or pure molecules from medicinal plants on COVID-19. We approach the possibilities of plant treatment/co-treatment and feeding applied to COVID-19. We also show coronavirus susceptibility and complications associated with nutrient deficiencies and then discuss the major food groups efficient on COVID-19 pathogenesis. Then, we covered emerging technologies using plant-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We conclude by giving nutrient and plants curative therapy recommendations which are of potential interest in the COVID-19 infection and could pave the way for pharmacological treatments or co-treatments of COVID-19."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"2194","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646c75f2409707691c4cf637","646c75f2409707691c4cf638","646c75f2409707691c4cf639","646c75f2409707691c4cf63a","646c75f2409707691c4cf63b","646c75f2409707691c4cf63c","646c75f2409707691c4cf63d","646c75f2409707691c4cf63e","646c75f2409707691c4cf63f","646c75f2409707691c4cf640","646c75f2409707691c4cf641","646c75f2409707691c4cf642","646c75f2409707691c4cf643","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","646c75f2409707691c4cf644","646c75f2409707691c4cf645","646c75f2409707691c4cf646","646c75f2409707691c4cf647","646c75f2409707691c4cf648","646c75f2409707691c4cf649","646c75f2409707691c4cf64a","646c75f2409707691c4cf64b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","issn":"2072-6643","eissn":"2072-6643","documentHash":"66793415-2acd-4481-8264-119c658e1575"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"629875e2409707571437f335","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"11","documentHash":"2302721e-b162-4344-925e-e1702662d057"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","anti-inflammatory effect","antioxidant activity","antiviral activity","diet","medicinal plants","nutrients"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747952392733"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646dbe904097077040481bb6","name":"Damian","lastName":"Matak","documentHash":"1b76faec-9e5e-48ea-8e4a-30b3d86a1bf0"},{"objectId":"646dbe904097077040481bb5","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Gromadka","documentHash":"2f3a3fca-2963-4df5-b319-c4e2b955751f"},{"objectId":"646dbe904097077040481bb4","name":"Judyta","lastName":"Kaczyńska","documentHash":"e61079af-26d6-41c0-b527-2141b19d0139"},{"objectId":"646dbe904097077040481bb3","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Gołębiewska","documentHash":"f966180c-542c-4932-a200-9c4e765f81a7"},{"objectId":"646dbe904097077040481bb2","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Małkowska","documentHash":"a94d0730-8494-4b42-9bac-0a78249cd6fc"},{"objectId":"646dbe904097077040481bb1","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Gołaszewska","documentHash":"e6ca11ff-09a4-4bd1-b559-22c783193ef7"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"92D7C04F8AB3A7BAFDD427A486DDA8E51BB9EF910CE1748A4A41C1B5DD9D2FBC73939751C42B68AF9AB4431CFBC5570C935A57B7BE63B7045AA234AF1888672B","documentHash":"da59b83b-fda3-4817-8136-ba0e1298aa2f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646dbe904097077040481baf","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0271531","publicUri":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0271531","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Safety and performance of surgical adhesives","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Tissue adhesives are an alternative to conventional surgical sutures to reduce the time and cost of wound closure and to improve patient comfort. The use of tissue adhesives does not require any subsequent intervention and significantly lowers the volume and rate of blood loss, and reduces the need for transfusions during and after surgery. However, based on their formulation, tissue adhesives' safety profile and functional properties may differ. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the basic safety and performance of NE'X Glue® Surgical Sealant, BioGlue® Surgical Sealant, and PREVELEAKTM Surgical Sealant in vitro.\n\nMethods: The basic safety of commercially available tissue adhesives was evaluated using MEM elution assay according to ISO 10993-5 and endotoxin level according to 85. USP. The in vitro performance was evaluated using lap-shear by tension loading test, burst strength test, degradation, and swelling assays.\n\nResults: NE'X Glue®, BioGlue®, and PREVELEAKTM did not cause cytotoxicity in MEM elution assay. All surgical adhesives are below the general limit of endotoxin contamination of 20 EU/device. NE'X Glue® and BioGlue® showed the highest and comparable strength properties in lap shear and burst strength tests compared to PREVELEAKTM. NE'X Glue® and PREVELEAKTM are characterized by lower degradation potential than BioGlue®. PREVELEAKTM is characterized by the highest swelling when compared to NE'X Glue® and BioGlue®.\n\nConclusions: NE'X Glue® is most versatile in terms of functional properties while maintaining the same safety profile as BioGlue® and PREVELEAKTM."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"e0271531","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646dbe904097077040481bb1","646dbe904097077040481bb2","646dbe904097077040481bb3","646dbe904097077040481bb4","646dbe904097077040481bb5","646dbe904097077040481bb6","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","issn":"1932-6203","eissn":"1932-6203","documentHash":"fcfcc06e-e7b2-4412-a89f-df94326b9f49"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62fb6e394097077a00d1056d","year":"2022","volume":"17","number":"8","documentHash":"63c6cd90-25d2-43ac-9104-256f364c256f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Endotoxins","Humans","Microsurgery","Sutures","Tissue Adhesives"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747952392952"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646ddd2640970770404a4e5b","name":"Harald","lastName":"Willschke","documentHash":"037bbcb5-3743-4521-9566-b0faa8dbbaef"},{"objectId":"646ddd2640970770404a4e5a","name":"Eva","lastName":"Schaden","documentHash":"bdfce66f-6025-4e4d-b5c2-6f231517e240"},{"objectId":"646ddd2640970770404a4e59","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kletecka-Pulker","documentHash":"9a92f809-c776-4846-8c09-b0874f793834"},{"objectId":"646ddd2640970770404a4e58","name":"Sabine","lastName":"Völkl-Kernstock","documentHash":"35249d16-0741-44bb-a91d-287669eb8750"},{"objectId":"646ddd2640970770404a4e57","name":"Dalibor","lastName":"Hrg","documentHash":"6327b8a4-d7fa-40dd-ae0f-f815cfc9c078"},{"objectId":"646ddd2640970770404a4e56","name":"Emil D","lastName":"Parvanov","documentHash":"56960087-64b0-4c0d-a5e4-edc03a8d1a23"},{"objectId":"646ddd2640970770404a4e55","name":"Mojca","lastName":"Hribersek","documentHash":"17710b45-7636-4c56-aea5-d1b6313526f5"},{"objectId":"646ddd2640970770404a4e54","name":"Elisabeth","lastName":"Klager","documentHash":"98c5749c-ee1b-4bfc-87c6-6b19c9a50c8d"},{"objectId":"646ddd2640970770404a4e53","name":"Fabian","lastName":"Eibensteiner","documentHash":"2c0d458c-bd03-4117-89e7-0591dc156faa"},{"objectId":"646ddd2640970770404a4e52","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Wochele-Thoma","documentHash":"a0f43cdd-bf66-40af-8c33-25c5cbe16074"},{"objectId":"646ddd2640970770404a4e51","name":"Andy Wai Kan","lastName":"Yeung","documentHash":"57de9613-8e7d-4465-a6de-7bb149928fc7"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646ddd2640970770404a4e4f","doi":"10.2196/34003","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/34003","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Official Websites Providing Information on COVID-19 Vaccination: Readability and Content Analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Online information on COVID-19 vaccination may influence people's perception and willingness to be vaccinated. Official websites of vaccination programs have not been systematically assessed before.\nObjective: This study aims to assess and compare the readability and content quality of web-based information on COVID-19 vaccination posted on official/governmental websites. Furthermore, the relationship between evaluated website parameters and country vaccination rates were calculated.\nMethods: By referring to an open data set hosted at Our World in Data, the 58 countries/regions with the highest total vaccination count as of July 8, 2021, were identified. Together with the websites from the World Health Organization and European Union, a total of 60 vaccination campaign websites were targeted. The \"frequently asked questions\" or \"questions and answers\" section of the websites were evaluated in terms of readability (Flesch Reading Ease score and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level), quality (Health On the Net Foundation code [HONcode] certification and Quality Evaluation Scoring Tool), and content stating vaccination duration of protection and potential side effects.\nResults: In terms of readability, the Flesch Reading Ease score of the vaccination frequently asked questions websites ranged between 11.2 and 69.5, with a mean of 40.9 (SD 13.2). Meanwhile, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level ranged between 6.5 and 17.6, with a mean of 12.1 (SD 2.8). In terms of quality, only 2 websites were HONcode certified, and the Quality Evaluation Scoring Tool score of the websites ranged between 7 and 20, with a mean of 15.3 (SD 3.1).

Late diagnosis remains a problem, alongside the high mutational burden encountered in lung cancer. Methods: We assessed the genetic profile of cancer genes in lung cancer using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets for mutations and validated the results in a separate cohort of 32 lung cancer patients using tumor tissue and whole blood samples for next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments. Another separate cohort of 32 patients was analyzed to validate some of the molecular alterations depicted in the NGS experiment. Results: In the TCGA analysis, we identified the most commonly mutated genes in each lung cancer dataset, with differences among the three histotypes analyzed. NGS analysis revealed TP53, CSF1R, PIK3CA, FLT3, ERBB4, and KDR as being the genes most frequently mutated. We validated the c.1621A>C mutation in KIT. The correlation analysis indicated negative correlation between adenocarcinoma and altered PIK3CA (r = −0.50918; p = 0.0029). TCGA survival analysis indicated that NRAS and IDH2 (LUAD), STK11 and TP53 (LUSC), and T53 (SCLC) alterations are correlated with the survival of patients.

As of October 6, 2022, the CDC has reported 195 cases in Poland, 78 in Hungary, 68 in the Czech Republic, 40 in Romania, 14 in Slovakia, and 2 in Moldova. Although the number of confirmed cases remains limited in comparison to reporting from much of western Europe, there is likely to be significant under-counting due to limited public health and surveillance systems and inadequate real-time reporting. Thus, there can easily be uncontrolled transmission due to a conundrum of social, political, and financial circumstances in the region.\nEastern European countries typically have weaker economies than their western counterparts. Historically, this has put a strain on the capacity of the national healthcare systems and public health agencies. The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic took a toll on the weaknesses of healthcare systems in eastern Europe, with lower health education levels among local populations leading to risky attitudes and subsequently adverse health outcomes. Since February 2022, the invasion of the armed forces of the Russian Federation in Ukraine has resulted in a humanitarian crisis with millions of refugees displaced within Ukraine, or fleeing to neighboring eastern European countries, and concerns about their inability to access healthcare. This fragile status quo emphasizes the need for high-quality real-time reporting to understand the scale of monkeypox transmission, allowing interventions that can mitigate the spread of MPX in the region."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"95","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646c9d83409707691c504713","646c9d83409707691c504714","646c9d83409707691c504715","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","646c9d83409707691c504716"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547887b","mniswId":"11837","title":"JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY","issn":"0146-6615","eissn":"1096-9071","documentHash":"15289319-169f-4817-bf28-92d77050e5d6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"637b919e40970701ee000946","year":"2022","volume":"95","number":"1","documentHash":"861410c6-dc05-453a-a82a-43cdc9be5d88"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Europe","Monkeypox","armed conflict","public health emergency"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747952392996"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646f2d5e409707768b5b79c2","name":"Simon P.","lastName":"Turner","documentHash":"ffbf9933-afcb-449f-8613-76859b58d72b"},{"objectId":"646f2d5e409707768b5b79c1","name":"Gareth","lastName":"Arnott","documentHash":"0f66d0c3-35fa-48c2-8998-e4ee8153736c"},{"objectId":"646f2d5e409707768b5b79c0","name":"Marianne","lastName":"Farish","documentHash":"f574c345-bf3e-4d77-9bec-08e008fe7a56"},{"objectId":"5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","name":"Irene","lastName":"Camerlink","uuid":"63511C46590F3B7E26AA60526C552EED8D9F0549F8DEE5333E681582883DA44BB38FF69E2CB85D2955FD7C17DC6CFA4F35E7BE97ABD84CE52B2422233F186398","documentHash":"21f3e447-93d1-4634-92b3-8aae9343fdc4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646f2d5e409707768b5b79bf","doi":"10.1186/s12983-022-00458-9","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12983-022-00458-9.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Sexual dimorphism in ritualized agonistic behaviour, fighting ability and contest costs of Sus scrofa","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Sexual selection has driven sexual dimorphism in agonistic behaviour in many species. Agonistic behaviour is fundamentally altered by domestication and captivity, but it is unclear whether ancestral sex differences remain. We aimed to evaluate the effect of sex on agonistic behaviour, fighting ability and contest costs. We studied this in domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) where aggression compromises welfare, and sexual dimorphism in aggression has been inconclusively demonstrated. Behaviour and physiology of 827 male and female juvenile pigs were studied during resident-intruder tests and dyadic contests at various ages, while accounting for the relative body weight difference between the opponents.\n\nResults: Males won in 79% of contests against females, even when at a large weight disadvantage. The effect of sex increased with age, with males having a 138 times higher likelihood of winning than females when 13 weeks old. In dyadic contests, males invested more time in non-damaging agonistic display behaviour and took longer before escalating into damaging aggression. Males showed ritualized display that included foaming from the mouth and piloerection of the neck hair, which was nearly always absent in females. Contest costs in terms of contest duration, blood lactate and skin lesions where higher for males, especially when fighting another male.\n\nConclusions: Profound sex differences were present for agonistic behaviour, fighting ability and contest costs, and became more pronounced as animals got older. Males invested more in ritualized display before escalating into costly fights, whereas females attacked sooner but also terminated contests more rapidly and with fewer costs. The sexual dimorphism in agonistic behaviour in juvenile domestic pigs is in line with the evolutionary relevance for females' maternal defence and males' competition for females."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedc79752340254fc421e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebedc79752340254fc421e2","646f2d5e409707768b5b79c0","646f2d5e409707768b5b79c1","646f2d5e409707768b5b79c2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d6c","mniswId":"6870","title":"Frontiers in Zoology","issn":"1742-9994","eissn":"1742-9994","documentHash":"d9603e60-512c-4bef-ad86-67b270d2c2fb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62737ab8409707200058f368","year":"2022","volume":"19","number":"1","documentHash":"e7dcf66b-e27f-497f-a208-3a35c70d4b45"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Aggression","Animal contest","Behaviour","Contest costs","Fighting ability","Ritualized display","Sex differences","Sexual dimorphism","Sus scrofa"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747952393000"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646f46b2409707768b5d940c","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Becker","documentHash":"69c2e46b-af59-488c-85f1-641a3c886b14"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a0c2","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Lewczuk","uuid":"8746DE8CD52FDC386E6F49C05C78B72093620644C196A10E8F0A092FECF6412488D92C5A61D6B58657EC745AEE009FB10591D93C5D933B746B67A20248283DDA","orcidId":"0000-0002-7892-7995","documentHash":"266aefa4-406a-43f4-8d31-7e32f3f23a09"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-10-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646f46b2409707768b5d940a","doi":"10.1016/j.livsci.2022.105112","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1871141322002852?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Phenotypic correlations between jump and gaits characteristics measured by inertial measurement units in horse jumping training - preliminary results","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"High correlations between gaits and jump characteristics are expected because even specialized jumpers need quality of movement to fulfil temporal performance requirements. Twelve sport horses (5-11 years) of different training levels were examined during regular training under high-level riders in two training centers. They covered a 3-4 km distance overcoming up to 30 obstacles. The first 15 jumps were analyzed. They jumped randomly chosen obstacles of the known characteristics from the basic, perpendicular approach. Jumping and movements parameters (179 observations) were measured using Seaver® devices based on inertial measurement unit technique. The following jump data were analyzed: height, length, reserve, frequency of approach, angle at take-off, acceleration of take-off, velocity, spatial shifting and energy by landing. The device measured 10 movement parameters. Frequency, elevation and regularity of walk, trot and canter, as well as trot symmetry were available. Relationships between parameters were analyzed using Pearson/Spearmann correlations (SAS, CORR) and partial correlations corrected for fixed effects of obstacle type and height, successive jump number, training center/rider and horse age-experience (SAS, GLM). Pearson and Spearmann correlations within jumping parameters (-0.48 – 0.95) and within gaits parameters (-0.64 – 0.78) were significant at least for p<0.05. Obtained partial correlations between gaits and jumping (above 0.3) showed that some gait characteristics are connected with jump quality. However, most partial correlations were low. Moderate values were noted for jump and canter frequencies (0.44), which is treated in horse selection as a jump determinant and walk regularity and three jumping parameters (0.33-36)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a8878c28a04739a0c2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"266","pagesFromTo":"105112","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646f46b2409707768b5d940c","5e7092a8878c28a04739a0c2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d0f","mniswId":"13726","title":"Livestock Science","issn":"1871-1413","eissn":"1878-0490","documentHash":"02fff2c1-dbd2-4330-9520-3cd219e7025b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646f46b2409707768b5d940b","year":"2022","volume":"266","documentHash":"c99c83de-013e-403e-bc16-875285fc7a3b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Horse","IMU","Biomechanics","Jumping","Movement","Training"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747952393008"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646dce0a40970770404935ec","name":"Sabine","lastName":"Völkl-Kernstock","documentHash":"8c92e21b-8648-4cf0-a6cd-386e15e4dc20"},{"objectId":"646dce0a40970770404935eb","name":"Harald","lastName":"Willschke","documentHash":"cd9601f7-3e88-4f17-b165-c875ba8ed3ca"},{"objectId":"646dce0a40970770404935ea","name":"Amer","lastName":"El-Kerdi","documentHash":"d587af3e-ae62-4cfa-bca8-8fd7c95d2168"},{"objectId":"646dce0a40970770404935e9","name":"Klara","lastName":"Doppler","documentHash":"4feb068c-8bed-491a-a374-914f9d0ff2fd"},{"objectId":"646dce0a40970770404935e8","name":"Fabian","lastName":"Eibensteiner","documentHash":"0a28f9f9-3c43-4b4b-97a0-bbbb6169d69c"},{"objectId":"646dce0a40970770404935e7","name":"Elisabeth","lastName":"Klager","documentHash":"7901760b-51aa-482c-8846-ed8c0718d9fd"},{"objectId":"646dce0a40970770404935e6","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kletecka-Pulker","documentHash":"959488aa-ebd1-435a-986e-4e571cc4b6ed"},{"objectId":"646dce0a40970770404935e5","name":"Andy Wai Kan","lastName":"Yeung","documentHash":"d06b8b54-0366-468b-a3c7-291af87f6665"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"646dce0a40970770404935e3","doi":"10.1097/pts.0000000000001040","publicUri":"https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/PTS.0000000000001040","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Patient Safety and Legal Regulations: A Total-Scale Analysis of the Scientific Literature","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective: The aim of the study was to quantitatively analyze the scientific literature landscape covering legal regulations of patient safety.\nMethods: This retrospective bibliometric analysis queried Web of Science database to identify relevant publications.

Despite this, the specific risk factors for chronic stress in pregnant sows are understudied. Group-housed pregnant sows continuously face numerous challenges associated with aspects of the physical (group type and size, flooring, feeding system) and social (stocking density, mixing strategy) environment. There are many well-known potent stressors for pigs that likely contribute to chronic, physiological stress, including overcrowding, hot temperatures, feed restriction, inability to forage, uncomfortable floors, and poor handling. Some of these stressors also contribute to the development of production diseases such as lameness, which in turn are also likely causes of chronic stress because of the associated pain and difficulty accessing resources. The aim of this review is to discuss potential risk factors for chronic stress in pregnant sows such as space allowance, group size and type (stable/dynamic), feeding level, lameness, pen design, feed system, enrichment and rooting material, floor type, the quality of stockmanship, environmental conditions, and individual sow factors. The mechanisms of action of both chronic and prenatal stress, as well as the effects of the latter on offspring are also discussed.

So far, somatic cell nucleus transfer, where G1-phase nuclei are transferred into cytoplasts obtained by enucleation of mature metaphase II (MII) oocytes followed by the activation of the reconstructed cells, is the most efficient approach to reprogram/remodel the differentiated nucleus. In general, in an enucleated oocyte (cytoplast), the nuclear envelope (NE, membrane) of an injected somatic cell nucleus breaks down and chromosomes condense. This condensation phase is followed, after subsequent activation, by chromatin decondensation and formation of a pseudo-pronucleus (i) whose morphology should resemble the natural postfertilization pronuclei (PNs). Thus, the volume of the transferred nuclei increases considerably by incorporating the content released from the germinal vesicles (GVs). In parallel, the transferred nucleus genes must be reset and function similarly as the relevant genes in normal embryo reprogramming. This, among others, covers the relevant epigenetic modifications and the appropriate organization of chromatin in pseudo-pronuclei. While reprogramming in SCNT is often discussed, the remodeling of transferred nuclei is much less studied, particularly in the context of the developmental potential of SCNT embryos. It is now evident that correct reprogramming mirrors appropriate remodeling. At the same time, it is widely accepted that the process of rebuilding the nucleus following SCNT is instrumental to the overall success of this procedure. Thus, in our contribution, we will mostly focus on the remodeling of transferred nuclei. In particular, we discuss the oocyte organelles that are essential for the development of SCNT embryos."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ffeae33085dcb0e357dcc5f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"165-172","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646dc3ae4097077040488409","646dc3ae409707704048840a","5ffeae33085dcb0e357dcc5f","646dc3ae409707704048840b","646dc3ae409707704048840c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478a33","mniswId":"12521","title":"Journal of Reproduction and Development","issn":"0916-8818","documentHash":"1724ac7b-d391-41bf-835a-ae16af257f83"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646dc3ae4097077040488408","year":"2022","volume":"68","number":"3","documentHash":"80b2ef0c-e65d-4c8f-9638-0edd0eae61ad"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Nucleus","Remodeling","Reprogramming","Selective enucleation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747952393025"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"647854a0409707222e31eb92","name":"Rajatava","lastName":"Basu","documentHash":"5bc0d806-7e3f-4892-bc32-30ba64badc5f"},{"objectId":"647854a0409707222e31eb91","name":"David G.","lastName":"Standaert","documentHash":"5ab2ef2d-483d-4a98-8309-f5e11db6cc43"},{"objectId":"647854a0409707222e31eb90","name":"James A.","lastName":"Bibb","documentHash":"9ca1a087-b81c-480b-a8fc-88bb9c3a234a"},{"objectId":"647854a0409707222e31eb8f","name":"Anna G.","lastName":"Sorace","documentHash":"0daac9f8-1182-4768-884b-fd7f8c91a22d"},{"objectId":"647854a0409707222e31eb8e","name":"John","lastName":"Totenhagen","documentHash":"d2347889-b454-432c-b41a-2d5b8d54e25b"},{"objectId":"647854a0409707222e31eb8d","name":"Matthew","lastName":"Macaluso","documentHash":"e14100fb-5426-4403-937f-fe9609b1c4d4"},{"objectId":"647854a0409707222e31eb8c","name":"Thomas","lastName":"van Groen","documentHash":"600dde72-6df7-4351-aea3-a569044703e9"},{"objectId":"647854a0409707222e31eb8b","name":"Alan A.","lastName":"Umfress","documentHash":"6a7b282e-df4f-4b60-9a7c-8b248f7e30ad"},{"objectId":"647854a0409707222e31eb8a","name":"Ayanabha","lastName":"Chakraborti","documentHash":"9b197a18-09c9-4ec5-b524-bc5fa17b0761"},{"objectId":"647854a0409707222e31eb89","name":"Suniti","lastName":"Bhaumik","documentHash":"035149fc-2f4e-465c-ae44-159cdaeed078"},{"objectId":"612d94299543c7051ff01b28","name":"Michel ","lastName":"Mickael","uuid":"6C0F190719C006F28401303260F31EB975571B3A00976F324446353810A0BEBD070D7D62CAB7367E88BFD3385375A74E21C88497F33459BA7C60F5AA5C3267FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-4186-4900","documentHash":"93399ad0-db2d-4c58-b04e-476d4131aaa8"}],"objectId":"647854a0409707222e31eb87","doi":"10.4049/jimmunol.2100869","publicUri":"https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article-pdf/208/8/2054/1500611/ji2100869.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"RORγt-Expressing Pathogenic CD4+ T Cells Cause Brain Inflammation during Chronic Colitis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Neurobehavioral disorders and brain abnormalities have been extensively reported in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. However, the mechanism causing neuropathological disorders in inflammatory bowel disease patients remains unknown. Studies have linked the Th17 subset of CD4+ T cells to brain diseases associated with neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment, including multiple sclerosis, ischemic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease. To better understand how CD4+ T lymphocytes contribute to brain pathology in chronic intestinal inflammation, we investigated the development of brain inflammation in the T cell transfer model of chronic colitis. Our findings demonstrate that CD4+ T cells infiltrate the brain of colitic Rag1 -/- mice in proportional levels to colitis severity. Colitic mice developed hypothalamic astrogliosis that correlated with neurobehavioral disorders. Moreover, the brain-infiltrating CD4+ T cells expressed Th17 cell transcription factor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) and displayed a pathogenic Th17 cellular phenotype similar to colonic Th17 cells. Adoptive transfer of RORγt-deficient naive CD4+ T cells failed to cause brain inflammation and neurobehavioral disorders in Rag1 -/- recipients, with significantly less brain infiltration of CD4+ T cells. The finding is mirrored in chronic dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in Rorcfl/fl Cd4-Cre mice that showed lower frequency of brain-infiltrating CD4+ T cells and astrogliosis despite onset of significantly more severe colitis compared with wild-type mice. These findings suggest that pathogenic RORγt+CD4+ T cells that aggravate colitis migrate preferentially into the brain, contributing to brain inflammation and neurobehavioral disorders, thereby linking colitis severity to neuroinflammation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"208","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"2054-2066","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28","647854a0409707222e31eb89","647854a0409707222e31eb8a","647854a0409707222e31eb8b","647854a0409707222e31eb8c","647854a0409707222e31eb8d","647854a0409707222e31eb8e","647854a0409707222e31eb8f","647854a0409707222e31eb90","647854a0409707222e31eb91","647854a0409707222e31eb92"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebffe0cad49b31ccece82ca","title":"The Journal of Immunology","issn":"0022-1767","eissn":"1550-6606","documentHash":"4cef7903-fb77-428e-a10c-1cb238971279"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"647854a0409707222e31eb88","year":"2022","volume":"208","number":"8","documentHash":"822a3f85-ea8c-4192-9a27-d90f7ae47deb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Neurobehavioral disorders","brain abnormalities","colitis","brain inflammation","neuroinflammation","RORγt"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747952393048"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094c0878c28a0473c3159","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Huminiecki","uuid":"1EE739F319563679918796A121718F258DC34A337D26EE7B80D1E4944C7F6D1A2A946B9C88BAF5F02F07D26C7F7C42888F74850788EEAB914AF1AE9A64875AFF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1943-4450","documentHash":"b85647e7-238c-4934-8c8e-a66a383e07b1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"61d5cdbe2467f0457303b883","doi":"10.3390/e24010017","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/1/17/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Virtual Gene Concept and a Corresponding Pragmatic Research Program in Genetical Data Science","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mendel proposed an experimentally verifiable paradigm of particle-based heredity that has been influential for over 150 years.

The concept integrates genetical, functional, and molecular features of the Mendelian paradigm. I argue that the virtual gene concept should be deployed pragmatically. Indeed, the concept has already inspired a practical research program related to systems genetics. The program includes questions about functionality of structural and categorical gene variants, about regulation of gene expression, and about roles of epigenetic modifications. The methodology of the program includes bioinformatics, machine learning, and deep learning.

Caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE) is caused by the same pathogen; however, the presence of CIP has been only occasionally reported in SRLV-infected goats. We carried out a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of histopathological lesions indicative of CIP in goats with symptomatic CAE, and to investigate whether CIP was associated with a higher prevalence of other types of pneumonia (purulent bronchopneumonia, fibrinous pleuropneumonia) or bacterial infections. Lung specimens and bronchial swabs were collected for histopathological and bacteriological examination, respectively, from 116 goats from a CAE-affected herd. All goats were euthanized due to severe clinical signs of CAE. The goats were seropositive for SRLV infection in two different ELISAs and the presence of SRLV antigen in the lung tissue was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Histopathologically, pneumonia of any type was confirmed in 82 goats (70.7%) and CIP was present in 67 goats (57.8%). In most goats, the severity of the histopathological features of pneumonia was mild. Bacteria were detected in bronchial swabs from 73 goats (62.9%). CIP proved to be significantly positively linked to the occurrence of purulent bronchopneumonia (p &lt; 0.001), fibrinous pleuropneumonia (p = 0.001), and of the infection of lungs with bacteria capable of causing pneumonia (p = 0.050).

The main goal of VIT is to induce a change from proinflammatory Th2 response to the Th1 response. However, the immune mechanism of acquiring rapid tolerance during VIT has not yet been fully understood. Therefore, we have analyzed (in 4-time points: 0, 2, 6, and 24 weeks after the initiation phase of VIT) the concentration of complement C3, C4, and C5 components, lymphocyte subpopulations (flow cytometry), as well as histamine and tryptase serum concentrations of 43 patients with wasp venom allergy (III and IV Müller grade) classified to ultra-rush treatment and 18 volunteers as the control group (CG). We observed that VIT affected the immune system by inducing changes in the complement system (decreased C3 and C4 compartment protein concentrations) and \"normalized\" the percentage of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the peripheral blood. Moreover, a significant increase in the percentage of nTreg in the blood of patients treated with VIT was observed. On the other hand, there were no changes in histamine or tryptase concentrations in the blood. Increased percentage of nTreg cells is a well-known mechanism by which VIT affects the immune system. Finally, VIT also modulated the concentrations of the complement components, which may be a previously unknown VIT mechanism of action."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709400878c28a0473b4a63","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"e7206, 1-11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656df67140970749a8636ce5","656df67140970749a8636ce6","656df67140970749a8636ce7","656df67140970749a8636ce8","5e709386878c28a0473abe86","656df67140970749a8636cea","5e7093bd878c28a0473b000e","5e7093f8878c28a0473b41bf","5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","5e709400878c28a0473b4a63"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"2045-2322","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Jady os","Ukąszenia i ukłucia przez owady - leczenie","Odczulanie immunologiczne","Alergologia","Immunologia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Wasp Venoms","Insect Bites and Stings - therapy","Desensitization, Immunologic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039396377"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63589ba9752340623bc06a56","name":"Wiktor","lastName":"Bendowski","uuid":"C59F5AA727E28F44A77BD3343E136139CC1E1FDC07482C1C3B49BCC2E4FD04C073AC90818FA84B5D98AC44AA4217718CC6495324DF2EC7DED2B2AF313040D918","documentHash":"4698e5cd-8b60-4c27-b28e-deec32820992"},{"objectId":"62a170bc4097070cd36e71d5","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Karwacki","documentHash":"5e171767-c089-47d8-a286-7bbd8f43a0c3"},{"objectId":"62a170bc4097070cd36e71d4","name":"Yaseen Kareem","lastName":"Karwan","documentHash":"e5e99a70-cba7-4c63-8180-66716ee64e15"},{"objectId":"602f9cd09543c7410626f68f","name":"Damian","lastName":"Bień","uuid":"839EEE2F860F9AE662835A788796C042F2531DB231F8977EDA19EF132F8B8E9B044B7FD3CDBBF9F6844302087749DB39A89C7DE33181B5E3125C35B4E3AF8B41","orcidId":"0000-0002-7236-0203","documentHash":"2b60977a-5f61-417c-b9a3-6cbe37c54cbb"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a047399828","name":"Artur","lastName":"Jóżwik","uuid":"BFBE241DDF4B149570AA3703800A25F0CDE93B1C4264239BABF6DF15004F8A1C786FFD25EEBC56546FCC94E0822AD59D94E422B8D8723F693AD042AB30FBBC43","orcidId":"0000-0001-5546-9891","documentHash":"9b809847-eb52-4086-95d8-3c676abd8ef9"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739242a","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Łozicki","uuid":"205F097D4117857C719D7EC0F5D63B21A0D329A6F88F6C8C8497F8E1C44ABD55490C5F7663BD62BA6AB26D7139C45073C8BE3EC158D3D7DEC8E1109E1D4556A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3864-3103","documentHash":"c25d2f8e-fb19-41e9-a338-f906230e29f5"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392423","name":"Monika","lastName":"Michalczuk","uuid":"CC14A9A2EB61FFE6135C5C58D0B20F8EE2BD9004A7386897EDF330645F881305D9F1C56ED3B77C48474160D56E6CF7A6A0038577228E087D8E46730CAD18A52C","orcidId":"0000-0002-8093-2822","documentHash":"16fed653-91c7-4151-aee7-ceef023a03a5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62a170bc4097070cd36e71ce","doi":"10.3390/ani12091085","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/9/1085","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Using Milk Thistle (Silybum marianum) Extract to Improve the Welfare, Growth Performance and Meat Quality of Broiler Chicken","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Modern poultry production looks for feed and water additives that improve the welfare of\r\nchickens.

This study compared the successive approximation of horses to their first work on a treadmill with horses hardly ever loaded (HE L) and regularly loaded (R L) into a trailer. Fourteen horses were divided into two groups (HE L n = 7 and R L n = 7) based on their experiences of entering into a trailer. All horses were taught using four stages of successive approximation. The average lead time was longer in the HE L than in the R L group, both in the first (HE L: 33.8 ± 12.4 s; R L: 17.6 ± 12.9 s; p = 0.035) and last stages (HE L: 12.0 ± 10.3 s; R L: 3.7 ± 1.0 s; p = 0.032) of trials. With the subsequent repetitions of each step, the heart rate decreased in both groups. Very few behaviors indicating fear or unwillingness (“rearing,” “sideways,” and “backwards”) were observed.

A simple two-choice test could be a promising tool to address the strength of social dependence in riding horses. The present study aimed, at exploring the effect of sex on social dependence, hypothesising that females will react with more anxiety than castrated males when exposed to social separation. We examined whether a two-choice test will predict social dependence in horses. Twenty-four experienced leisure horses (7 mares and 17 geldings) were tested with a simple two-choice (food vs equine companion) preference and subsequent social dependence test in three sessions within the test (Session1: separation with a preferred companion; Session2: isolation, and Session3: social stimulus, i.e. conspecific passing nearby). During the test, six horses chose the companion (companion-motivated, CM), and 18 horses chose the treats (food-motivated, FM). The choice was skewed for mares, as significantly more mares than geldings preferred the companion over the food (CM: Nmares=4, Ngeldings=2 and FM: Nmares=3, Ngeldings=15). In isolation, CM horses displayed significantly reduced feeding duration and standing still towards increased arousal, i.e. locomotor activity: trotting, cantering, pawing and vocalisations, as compared to FM horses that were calmer and more comfortable without companions than CM horses. Our results indicate that mares, compared to geldings, showed weaker interest in feeding, and longer bouts of movement (walk and trot), which indicated the prevailing willingness to reunite with the companions and were more socially dependent compared to castrated male horses. The authors propose that this simple two-choice test can be used as another test to assess social dependence in horses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fc6f"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a047399792"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"254","pagesFromTo":"1-26","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a1878c28a047399792","5e709217878c28a04738fc6f","633ec4684097077179685132","633ec4684097077179685133","633ec4684097077179685134","633ec4684097077179685135"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477110","mniswId":"1437","title":"Applied Animal Behaviour Science","issn":"0168-1591","eissn":"1872-9045","documentHash":"3ee1b47f-7b8e-45bd-85d8-cc11dc26a272"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633ec4684097077179685130","year":"2022","volume":"254","documentHash":"2e97fb4b-a5a8-486c-ad5c-82276c433f8c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Horse","Equitation","Social dependence","Sex differences","Personality"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039396567"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709483878c28a0473becbe","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Konieczka","uuid":"8EABCC2EFDE8C5F924F284A0F3A7BAEA9A366A5DF2F1D3EDABD7B26FC32628CEB32B230A9EEEB4520D4E93B3F0C76E38836BB1BE44A1EF3B4022642535AFB7AB","orcidId":"0000-0002-2054-5636","documentHash":"ae2ba6bc-58d8-4eac-8b8b-4c82684eee7d"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc097","name":"Dobrochna","lastName":"Adamek-Urbańska","uuid":"AA8F2DFB75CEFB2A73A7C87F7A9E6BAF150DF101CD77571753E4CFA02AE102E59B51E54EC21E8116B5E2EA8C1DDB4F2F702FBC64F76336DF98B539C8F8B959CD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3840-935X","documentHash":"9c95cc86-46f8-47bf-b3a4-9c218ab2406b"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc092","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Damaziak","uuid":"0C671D8D8F846EFC78895109024F2C4A56D5CADF242B40E1A686DD7CF463622B6CA5101B4BAB885E498A6B6A3FC0BDEE42B86F72555F9327F4D5B4259CD9BF89","orcidId":"0000-0001-5940-266X","documentHash":"b0f72f45-c0e3-4ac6-a1e5-77bd9e5e752e"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7ce9","name":"Żaneta","lastName":"Zdanowska-Sąsiadek","uuid":"D7E27058B96EA2C03154818663BDF5A496B6FA4F1DAF1E633BFA8DF1FE968619F0A398F1B424856547EB5F730747382F8ED41F90AD8DE76D0A642A3A921667EF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2593-8479","documentHash":"2efd1674-0fee-43b3-8411-455363561000"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a5413","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Stelmasiak","uuid":"81D33B8AB2371125D1356373B669124C422E7AA39EA535CF9272582C339B818810ABB6D2585B51B8B8B0FA5E500EC22B83B8CC3745205F6467AE2EBDD1376791","orcidId":"0000-0003-0249-6030","documentHash":"7607be3d-70f7-4fc1-b22d-c3cbbaf4b3df"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a540a","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Pogorzelski","uuid":"F9ADBD097E2AF439B8E96D89EE30B897B4E1C54A67E66B4F819B806534AF62155B995E1A8C58939DA9050468E186D8DAAE2B44FFCD23B30A21264E1B6C69E5A3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3443-4571","documentHash":"37b779dc-222d-4b13-91ea-7ddb8b1fb94b"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941b5","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Gozdowski","uuid":"2ADA9EA7DF267002603A97CF88CDEF61AB807E32BA879885200805C6AC0C3DD6C66FD1D5638F9E4F6F5D235AE1816EE70897E20A90C10A08020A68CB98E1B46D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7365-7607","documentHash":"bdf0462b-f3f6-4518-93b5-ea7e9a59d71c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JUNE","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"62862f96409707249f898c2d","doi":"10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.115309","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377840122001079?dgcid=author","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Water extract of yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.) leaf improves production parameters, tissue antioxidant status and intestinal microbiota activity in turkeys","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed to analyze the effect of water extract of yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.) leaf (WEYL) on tissue oxidative properties, histological indices, gut microbiota composition and activity, and production parameters in turkeys. A total of 360 (1-day-old) female poults were randomly assigned to one of three treatments (8 replications × 15 poults each). The turkeys were fed in a four-phase system for 15 weeks: group C (control)—diet that did not contain WEYL; group E1—diet supplemented with 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.2 g/kg WEYL; and group E2—diet supplemented with 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, and 0.3 g/kg WEYL. The results of the analyses of body weight, feed intake, and feed conversion indicated that WEYL did not have any effect on these parameters (P > 0.05). However, WEYL increased the proportion of skin with subcutaneous fat (P = 0.006), and when supplemented at higher ratios, it reduced the proportion of liver (P = 0.010) and improved slaughter performance (P = 0.044). Furthermore, consumption of WEYL-supplemented diet led to an improvement in the antioxidative status and glutathione peroxidase activity in the blood and breast muscles, and also increased the superoxide dismutase activity in the blood and liver (P < 0.05). Supplementation with WEYL at a lower dose (E1) resulted in reduced malondialdehyde concentration in the blood, while supplementation at a higher dose (E2) caused a reduction in ascorbic acid concentration in the liver (P < 0.05). Turkeys that were fed with WEYL-containing diet had a higher amount of cholinesterase in the blood (P = 0.045), and those fed with the diet containing a higher dose of WEYL (E2) had a higher level of albumins and total protein (P < 0.05). Turkeys from E2 group had the longest villi and shallowest crypts, but the percentage of proliferating nuclei was found to be the highest in the group that received a diet with a lower dose of WEYL (E1) (P < 0.05). Turkeys from E2 group showed a decreased relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. in the cecal content as well as reduced β-glucosidase activity, while those from the E1 group showed reduced β-galactosidase activity (P < 0.05). In summary, dietary supplementation with WEYL can help improve tissue antioxidative status and modify the enzymatic activity of the cecal microflora in turkeys, with no negative influence on the production outcomes of these birds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea4","uid":"bdue8IYFHJjfPMqPlXSYxbA","uuid":"30312732-6777-4ca9-84e6-ad3f07bc18c2","name":"Instytut Fizjologii i Żywienia Zwierząt im.

effect of dried ostrich meat in the diet on the hematological blood parameters using the rat model. The study was carried out on 72 six‐week‐old male Wistar rats divided into 2 groups: rats fed for a month standard diet (SD) with iron level of 200 ppm and rats fed diet with 5ppm of iron (FeD) (n=36 rats in each group). Afterwards this period animals were classified as non- and iron deficient based on hemoglobin values and either of the 2 groups was further divided into 4 groups of 9 animals: receiving the SD, SD with ostrich meat, FeD or FeD with ostrich meat. Blood samples were collected to determine hematological parameters i.e. red blood cells (RBC), the hemoglobin (HGB), ferritin level and hematocrit (HCT). The ferritin and HCT levels in rats suffering from iron deficiency receiving SD with ostrich meat were significantly higher at the end of the experiment as compared to the beginning of it (91.90 ng/mL vs. 59.60 ng/mL (p=0.005) and 46.82 vs. 34.41% (p=0.05). Thus, ostrich meat may be a good source of heme iron and can be used as a supplement in diet of individuals with iron deficiencies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","uid":"bHvub0W7DW61k4FKLYJQ3Zw","uuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Długosza w Częstochowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70931d878c28a0473a300c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","parentUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","rootUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5f87bf6c085dcb410a25ef74","5e709430878c28a0473b7ce9","5e7092a1878c28a047399828","5e7092ae878c28a04739a77f","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","5f98f237085dcb424e4c1b9c","61e23fb87523403b69b37a94"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"40","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"479-486","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f87bf6c085dcb410a25ef74","5e709430878c28a0473b7ce9","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3155","5f98f237085dcb424e4c1b9c","61e23fb87523403b69b37a94","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7092ae878c28a04739a77f","5e70923a878c28a047392184","5e70931d878c28a0473a300c","612d94299543c7051ff01b28","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e7092a1878c28a047399828"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547703a","mniswId":"1152","title":"Animal Science Papers and Reports","issn":"0860-4037","websiteLink":"http://ighz.pl/?p0=5&p1=34","documentHash":"613ac4d3-b5ca-401a-8b22-ff151335976e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63da60a34097076b4a8dde56","year":"2022","volume":"40","number":"4","documentHash":"a41cf770-ad0a-4c7b-994c-601db2efe89b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["iron deficiency","ostrich meat","heme and non-heme iron","heamatological parameters"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039396584"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6582e5694097076c14bc0e97","name":"Nicolas","lastName":"Arkells","documentHash":"75e6963b-819a-4033-b4a0-3847c7688032"},{"objectId":"6582e5694097076c14bc0e96","name":"Maurizio","lastName":"Battino","documentHash":"3e413e5c-7a24-488b-b542-3f9cbb834de8"},{"objectId":"6582e5694097076c14bc0e95","name":"Vasil","lastName":"Pirgozliev","documentHash":"9d187d61-9f76-4f11-b67c-ae972dcb8954"},{"objectId":"6582e5694097076c14bc0e94","name":"Linfang","lastName":"Huang","documentHash":"91708a1c-2d6b-4d2b-b316-dbce4f5f0553"},{"objectId":"6582e5694097076c14bc0e91","name":"Ishveen","lastName":"Chopra","documentHash":"eea56616-7ac8-483a-88b2-b9353f4a1074"},{"objectId":"6582e5694097076c14bc0e8f","name":"Olaf K.","lastName":"Horbańczuk","documentHash":"fd1a7556-a141-405f-b863-935f8d466618"},{"objectId":"6582e5694097076c14bc0e8e","name":"Ronan","lastName":"Lordan","documentHash":"df2023be-0db4-4a22-8489-34ee5b17d00c"},{"objectId":"6582e5694097076c14bc0e8d","name":"Avijeet S.

Nutraceuticals comprise diverse food-derived product categories that have become widespread due to increased consumer awareness of potential health benefits and the need for improved wellness. This targeted review is designed to identify the current global trends, market opportunities, and regulations that drive the nutraceutical industry. Safety and efficacy concerns are also explored with a view to highlighting areas that necessitate further research and oversight. Key drivers of the nutraceutical market include aging populations, consumer awareness, consumer lifestyle, increasing cost of healthcare, and marketing channels. Although some nutraceuticals hold promising preventive and therapeutic opportunities, there is a lack of a universal definition and regulatory framework among countries. Moreover, there is a lack of adequate evidence for their efficacy, safety, and effectiveness, which was even further highlighted during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Future prospective epidemiological studies can delineate the health impact of nutraceuticals and help set the scientific basis and rationale foundation for clinical trials, reducing the time and cost of trials themselves. Together, an understanding of the key drivers of the nutraceutical market alongside a consistent and well-defined regulatory framework will provide further opportunities for growth, expansion, and segmentation of nutraceuticals applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e70929c878c28a047399193"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"175","issue":"January","pagesFromTo":"1-11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6582e5694097076c14bc0e8d","6582e5694097076c14bc0e8e","6582e5694097076c14bc0e8f","6582e5694097076c14bc0e91","6582e5694097076c14bc0e94","6582e5694097076c14bc0e95","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960","6582e5694097076c14bc0e96","6582e5694097076c14bc0e97","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7092a1878c28a047399828"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479221","mniswId":"15959","title":"Pharmacological Research","issn":"1043-6618","eissn":"1096-1186","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"a8a1b02d-b604-44ba-a55f-b659a907c394"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Natural health products","Nutraceutical policy","Nutraceuticals","Nutraceuticals commercialization","Preventive medicine"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039396799"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646dc319409707704048736e","name":"Ann-Kathrin","lastName":"Ruf","documentHash":"046bf99e-2064-40ad-8485-0cd85cda82f9"},{"objectId":"646dc319409707704048736d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Teufel","documentHash":"f4af49cd-bbaf-4e2e-8d5e-1d60dac30aab"},{"objectId":"646dc319409707704048736c","name":"Sophie","lastName":"Klomfar","documentHash":"5aa9004d-5b89-4a37-8bf8-bf332215e23c"},{"objectId":"646dc319409707704048736b","name":"Elisabeth","lastName":"Klager","documentHash":"f0de4639-7f77-4c7f-b36c-62bf995c0a0f"},{"objectId":"646dc319409707704048736a","name":"Marcus","lastName":"Gabriel","documentHash":"ebf91325-d3ae-4039-a8bc-44ea718ac072"},{"objectId":"646dc3194097077040487369","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Eitenberger","documentHash":"00785cb8-f545-46ed-915a-01ea768cc3f4"},{"objectId":"646dc3194097077040487368","name":"Klara","lastName":"Doppler","documentHash":"dae98878-1f15-4360-9234-642456c57257"},{"objectId":"646dc3194097077040487367","name":"Sabine","lastName":"Völkl-Kernstock","documentHash":"5ef44b72-6900-4e41-92a0-90c6db334964"},{"objectId":"646dc3194097077040487366","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kletecka-Pulker","documentHash":"f90aaebd-9f0d-4d3a-be3d-b69d26e18fb5"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"objectId":"646dc3194097077040487365","doi":"10.1177/00302228221133895","publicUri":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00302228221133895","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Views on Assisted Suicide and Religious Beliefs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"After the Austrian constitutional court decided to legalise assisted suicide, we conducted this cross-sectional survey study to assess how persons living in Austria viewed the decision, and whether their views associated with religious and/or moral beliefs.

Copper is essential for maintaining the life processes in all living cells, because several copper-dependent enzymes play an important role in key physiological processes like cellular respiration, oxygen radical scavenging, the transport of iron and neurotransmitter synthesis. Maintaining copper homeostasis implies maintaining the constancy of copper levels in the cells and fluids throughout the body, in order to support the enzymes and other factors that underlie normal life processes. Therefore, living organisms have developed complex mechanisms for maintaining their physiological copper level, because an excess copper level can be toxic for the cells. In the cell, copper homeostasis is controlled by a network of copper-binding proteins and transporters. Furthermore, copper uptake is mediated by the membrane transporter CTR1 and CTR2 proteins. In the cytoplasm, it is bound to a unique group of metallochaperones (ATOX1, CCS COX17) and transported to different cell compartments, where it is linked to the recipient proteins. The Cu-transporting ATPases (ATP7A and ATP7B) are responsible for transferring copper into the Golgi apparatus, where the copper is added to the active sites of enzymes, and it is also directed onto the path of excess cellular copper removal to prevent the occurrence of toxicity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709313878c28a0473a27a9","5e709316878c28a0473a29d6","5f3f8e8d752340073806a850","602f54cd9543c7410626f34e"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a775","5e7092a8878c28a04739a089"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"70","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"201-212","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709316878c28a0473a29d6","5e709313878c28a0473a27a9","5f3f8e8d752340073806a850","602f54cd9543c7410626f34e","5e7092ae878c28a04739a775","5e7092a8878c28a04739a089"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477cf4","mniswId":"6654","title":"Folia Biologica","issn":"0015-5497","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5c77f044-4497-4dca-ba93-25a62d6f2ed9"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["copper metabolism","SOD1","CTR1","CCS","Cu-transporting ATPases","CTR2","ATOX1"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039396808"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646db90b409707704047efa9","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Goscik","documentHash":"c36f61ab-11b5-450c-bf04-1b563359859f"},{"objectId":"63881fb975234052dad46665","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Jaszczyk","uuid":"6F9183570EEF8A13FFB3B0980E4D63BFC38B702A6DDB1148D723147AA7EF55E20F6E47A486E2BB561878F690F45AF99E21F6ABCC770BCC05FD6A6162F5D7653C","documentHash":"d1dffe61-20d1-4db0-9ca0-4bb793f13190"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c02a5","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Stankiewicz","uuid":"2DECC35439ECF87D059D42D92296066E05C0AA8DE7B8FFD4F09DA8B0E0A253149F6136C34EA33D1CACE7ED7C3F7B831E38C27543932B195CB25E4D00CA1D9854","orcidId":"0000-0002-2719-6205","documentHash":"c3212fb5-ce3c-4e8e-a524-18b6b2434a50"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a047399816","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Juszczak","uuid":"FB152F95AA9FDF3EA1252BAC1246F50E008E79910F6D1C008E29CE496FB3C201327F63D7E16E442C7A57255989F45467E859FD5D5F70935449D9EE12F5374E47","orcidId":"0000-0002-0976-6905","documentHash":"e74e1445-37b1-4c71-9e67-0b2491d57755"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646db90b409707704047efa5","doi":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2022.110558","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0278584622000501?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Stress and the brain transcriptome: Identifying commonalities and clusters in standardized data from published experiments","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Interpretation of transcriptomic experiments is hindered by many problems including false positives/negatives inherent to big-data methods and changes in gene nomenclature. To find the most consistent effect of stress on brain transcriptome, we retrieved data from 79 studies applying animal models and 3 human studies investigating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The analyzed data were obtained either with microarrays or RNA sequencing applied to samples collected from more than 1887 laboratory animals and from 121 human subjects. Based on the initial database containing a quarter million differential expression effect sizes representing transcripts in three species, we identified the most frequently reported genes in 223 stress-control comparisons. Additionally, the analysis considers sex, individual vulnerability and contribution of glucocorticoids. We also found an overlap between gene expression in PTSD patients and animals which indicates relevance of laboratory models for human stress response. Our analysis points to genes that, as far as we know, were not specifically tested for their role in stress response (Pllp, Arrdc2, Midn, Mfsd2a, Ccn1, Htra1, Csrnp1, Tenm4, Tnfrsf25, Sema3b, Fmo2, Adamts4, Gjb1, Errfi1, Fgf18, Galnt6, Slc25a42, Ifi30, Slc4a1, Cemip, Klf10, Tom1, Dcdc2c, Fancd2, Luzp2, Trpm1, Abcc12, Osbpl1a, Ptp4a2).

These animals\nprovide an important part in the food chain for many species of predators. Unfortunately, the\nbrown hare populations have decreased drastically in Poland due to many threats. These animals\nare currently threatened with extinction, so a protection plans are necessary. Previous analyses of\nbrown hares in Poland based only on mtDNA sequence variability. The aim of this study was to\ndetect genetic diversity and population structure of brown hares in Poland using microsatellites. A\ntotal of 140 brown hares were collected from seven different regions in south-eastern Poland and\n12 microsatellite loci was analyzed. A total number of 140 alleles were identified. The number of\nalleles per locus ranged from 3 (Sol33Le) to 23 (Sol30Le). From the pool of all identified alleles, 41\n(29.2%) were unique for given regions. The average expected and observed heterozygosity ranged\nfrom 0.29 to 0.91 and 0.33 to 1.00, respectively. The highest genetic distance was found between\nthe regions: Lublin and Kielce, while the lowest was detected between Białobrzegi and Kazimierza\nWielka. The Structure program and unrooted phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the seven\npopulation of hare is largely divided into three to two different clades. The results reveal unique genetic variation in hare populations in south-eastern Poland and provide critical information for\nthe conservation of this species. Our research point to consider the conservation of the brown hare\npopulation in Poland and habitat restoration and a net of ecological corridors, which could help the\nsurvival and expansion of threatened hare population in Poland."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7ce9","5e7092ae878c28a04739a77f","5e7092a1878c28a0473998b4","5e7092b0878c28a04739ab9a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"40","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"185-201","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a1878c28a0473998b4","5e7092ae878c28a04739a77f","5e709430878c28a0473b7ce9","5e7092b0878c28a04739ab9a","6655d80940970762c87f70fc","6655d82d40970762c87f7b90"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547703a","mniswId":"1152","title":"Animal Science Papers and Reports","issn":"0860-4037","eissn":"2300-8342","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"fe90747c-1196-49b0-9210-8098e8db0aa8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6311dd5d409707352b6a62a5","year":"2022","volume":"40","number":"2","documentHash":"db3c37cd-7e1e-4af2-801a-e6932a7cc60f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["genetic analysis","microsatellite DNA","hunting regions","Lepus europaeus","hare"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039396821"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64785ce5409707222e331080","name":"Nikolay T.","lastName":"Tzvetkov","documentHash":"0c319834-f439-445e-bcd6-102b22f9be9b"},{"objectId":"64785ce5409707222e33107f","name":"Iliyan V.","lastName":"Ognyanov","documentHash":"bfff6d4e-11f0-446e-99f4-6d4be8f5c367"},{"objectId":"64785ce5409707222e33107e","name":"Ivan P.","lastName":"Bogdanov","documentHash":"d33bc6bb-ee49-415c-bc70-b466349e770b"},{"objectId":"64785ce5409707222e33107d","name":"Martina I.","lastName":"Peeva","documentHash":"7d7c1679-896a-40ec-b373-359f7f0a6b74"},{"objectId":"64785ce5409707222e33107c","name":"Tsonko","lastName":"Kolev","documentHash":"3b4ce821-1b9a-4ecf-bb1e-aec9b0f59041"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64785ce5409707222e33107a","doi":"10.1515/ncrs-2022-0181","publicUri":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ncrs-2022-0181/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The crystal structure of Histidinium hydrogensquarate, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub>","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"C10H11N3O6, monoclinic, P21/c (no. 14), a = 7.4928(12) Å, b = 14.860(3) Å, c = 11.0593(18) Å, β = 109.465(5)°, V = 1161.0(4) Å3, Z = 4, Rgt(F) = 0.0439, wR ref (F2) = 0.1060, T = 300.0(2) K."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"237","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"601-603","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64785ce5409707222e33107c","64785ce5409707222e33107d","64785ce5409707222e33107e","64785ce5409707222e33107f","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","64785ce5409707222e331080"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479b29","mniswId":"20501","title":"Zeitschrift für Kristallographie -

This study employed the Seaver IMU system to measure jumping characteristics of horses with differing age-competition experience during regular training. It was hypothesized that experience level results in lower variability of jumping parameters. Twelve Warmblood horses aged 5 to 6 years with/without competition experience and 7 to 11 years with experience were investigated during regular training in 2 training centers. Consistent number of 10 successive jumps of the individual chosen course of vertical and spread obstacles (5th -15th) were analyzed and the following parameters were measured: jump height, reserve and length; taking off angle, acceleration, velocity; jump spatial shifting, energy by landing, and frequency of approach strides. Preliminary analysis confirmed comparable physiological effort in 2 training center based on heart rate, distance and duration measurements. The multifactorial analysis of variance for biomechanical data included in the statistical model the random effect of horse and fixed effects of training center, age-experience group, successive jump number, obstacle type and height. Four parameters were significantly different between the younger, inexperienced group and experienced younger and older horses: height of jump (P = .01), frequency of approach strides (P = .005), acceleration of taking off (P = .01), and energy by landing (P = .0013). Standard errors for almost all the parameters reached higher values for the youngest, inexperienced horses. Variability of jumping parameters was lower for experienced groups of horses, suggesting higher precision on obstacle courses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a8878c28a04739a0c2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"119","pagesFromTo":"104146","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646f5964409707768b5f7402","5e7092a8878c28a04739a0c2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547869c","mniswId":"11012","title":"Journal of Equine Veterinary Science","issn":"0737-0806","documentHash":"0268b707-ba97-45a0-a261-b9b99fb2315d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646f5964409707768b5f7401","year":"2022","volume":"119","documentHash":"3383502c-487e-4ebe-bcb5-3ece63cc636a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Acceleration","Animals","Biomechanical Phenomena","Forelimb","Horses","Sports","Technology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039396833"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646c72bb409707691c4cd1b6","name":"Tino","lastName":"Schenk","documentHash":"6dc9a311-4d96-4637-9b55-b84017cd1261"},{"objectId":"646c72bb409707691c4cd1b5","name":"Annamaria","lastName":"Brioli","documentHash":"f4f50ece-4dac-4ebf-b341-22fb4e4af1fb"},{"objectId":"646c72bb409707691c4cd1b4","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kamiński","documentHash":"27a3db7a-fd95-4646-96b2-42d52887af56"},{"objectId":"646c72bb409707691c4cd1b3","name":"Veronica","lastName":"Gil","documentHash":"aef7c14d-1b6f-41a0-a69f-5f3d4b5ee36c"},{"objectId":"646c72bb409707691c4cd1b2","name":"Faezeh","lastName":"Ghazvini Zadegan","documentHash":"d07a6ad6-7df9-4794-a8ed-89f71c02159a"},{"objectId":"646c72bb409707691c4cd1b1","name":"Clara","lastName":"Stanko","documentHash":"646e96c9-2f35-4967-a081-e4e9d4e79061"},{"objectId":"646c72bb409707691c4cd1b0","name":"Yordan","lastName":"Sbirkov","documentHash":"dec085c0-e0c5-4e5f-bced-bdf9c3a4af2f"},{"objectId":"646c72bb409707691c4cd1af","name":"Kevin R.","lastName":"Petrie","documentHash":"754dc13f-4cd5-4cb4-b422-1910c798d605"},{"objectId":"646c72bb409707691c4cd1ae","name":"Sven","lastName":"Stengel","documentHash":"b57b9d83-b5d3-418c-9b47-18ec9bef33bf"},{"objectId":"5ed5cda37523404d1000e898","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Skopek","uuid":"0AE3B047D8E7BC1914123C976AF2B98EA7E2ACD71221339E8C330A680FA5A592C1CB541F5F6D900A300C91F783FE1B05BD6CED2CE9EACB5648A3AADA378CE528","orcidId":"0000-0002-8669-3359","documentHash":"179efcd0-da33-4a49-8ccf-9abd1184d7fa"},{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7b57","name":"Artur","lastName":"Zelent","uuid":"CE00BA5E249ADE8E21AB91CCA3B5C74221AD6C1CDA96BFC193212A8EFF1502AE0D6BC448AD14453FCA14C4B0EBB73D1E49A97FE100692C0E3B22F1B4EB2D728C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7968-9888","documentHash":"9c74bd28-fe98-4bcc-9ad8-a6da6ae1d62b"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9b8b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"92D7C04F8AB3A7BAFDD427A486DDA8E51BB9EF910CE1748A4A41C1B5DD9D2FBC73939751C42B68AF9AB4431CFBC5570C935A57B7BE63B7045AA234AF1888672B","documentHash":"da59b83b-fda3-4817-8136-ba0e1298aa2f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646c72bb409707691c4cd1ac","doi":"10.1111/bjh.18187","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjh.18187","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Suppression of MYC by PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibition in combination with all-trans retinoic acid treatment for therapeutic gain in acute myeloid leukaemia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Aberrant activity of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR [PAM]) pathway, as well as suppressed retinoic acid signalling, contribute to enhanced proliferation and the differentiation blockade of immature myeloid cells in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Inhibition of the PAM pathway was shown to affect especially mixed-lineage leukaemia-rearranged AML. Here, we sought to test a combined strategy using small molecule inhibitors against members of the PAM signalling pathway in conjunction with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to target a larger group of different AML subtypes. We find that ATRA treatment in combination with inhibition of PI3K (ZSTK474), mTOR (WYE132) or PI3K/mTOR (BEZ235, dactolisib) drastically reduces protein levels of the proto-oncogene MYC. In combination with BEZ235, ATRA treatment led to almost complete eradication of cellular MYC, G1 arrest, loss of clonal capacity and terminal granulocytic differentiation. We demonstrate that PAM inhibitor/ATRA treatment targets MYC via independent mechanisms. While inhibition of the PAM pathway causes MYC phosphorylation at threonine 58 via glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta and subsequent degradation, ATRA reduces its expression. Here, we present an approach using a combination of known drugs to synergistically reduce aberrant MYC levels, thereby effectively blocking proliferation and enabling differentiation in various AML subtypes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej

separately from adult cattle, the interest in prolonged contact between dairy calves and lactating cows during early life is increasing. Previous research has documented positive effects of cow-calf contact (CCC) on for example early calf growth and udder health of suckled cows, but also negative effects such as increased separation distress and reduced weight gains after weaning. The aim of this study was to use information from European farms with prolonged cow-calf contact to identify innovative solutions to common challenges for CCC farms. Commercial dairy farms that kept calves with adult lactating cows for seven days or more after birth were invited to participate, and interviews were performed with 104 farmers from six countries. During interviews, information about farm management, calf rearing, farmers' perception of animal health on their farm, and farmers' drivers and barriers for implementing CCC were collected. We found that CCC was practised in a large variety of housing and management systems, and that calves could be reared together with their dam, with foster cows, or using a combination of the two. The contact period varied considerably (7-305 days) between farms and about 25% of the farms manually milk fed the calves during parts of the milk feeding period. Daily contact time varied between farms, from 30 minutes per day to permanent contact except at milking. Behaviours indicative of separation distress, most commonly vocalisation in cows and calves, were reported by 87% of the farmers. Strategies to alleviate separation distress, for example simultaneous gradual weaning and separation, were used on some farms. Building constraints were most often mentioned as a barrier for implementing CCC. Our findings suggest that CCC is practised in a variety of commonly used husbandry systems. Reported challenges were primarily related to weaning and separation, and to building constraints; these aspects should be areas of future research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"100624","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646b70e3409707633dfe9c2d","646b70e3409707633dfe9c2e","646b70e3409707633dfe9c2f","646b70e3409707633dfe9c30","646b70e3409707633dfe9c31","646b70e3409707633dfe9c32","646b70e3409707633dfe9c33","646b70e3409707633dfe9c34","646b70e3409707633dfe9c35","646b70e3409707633dfe9c36","646b70e3409707633dfe9c37","646b70e3409707633dfe9c38","646b70e3409707633dfe9c39","5e7092ac878c28a04739a6b0","646b70e3409707633dfe9c3a","646b70e3409707633dfe9c3b","646b70e3409707633dfe9c3c","646b70e3409707633dfe9c3d","646b70e3409707633dfe9c3e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547702a","mniswId":"1135","title":"Animal.","issn":"1751-7311","eissn":"1751-732X","documentHash":"75e7d827-d0e7-4aaa-99e6-ce35edc7b49b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646b70e3409707633dfe9c2c","year":"2022","volume":"16","number":"9","documentHash":"a0427e17-641a-47f3-92ae-403c4710059f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Calf rearing","Cow-calf contact","Farmer attitudes","Health","Management"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039396854"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"643bbd5c4097076e1eac9083","name":"Małgorzata Anna","lastName":"Szewczuk","documentHash":"aa166c89-ed4e-4324-8614-ae9df71a2ddd"},{"objectId":"643bbd5c4097076e1eac9082","name":"Agata","lastName":"Witczak","documentHash":"7aad1267-5e9d-434d-8d06-75b91e8da24e"},{"objectId":"643bbd5c4097076e1eac9081","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Dmytrów","documentHash":"ea28d683-f38c-4894-b26d-04117b58f83b"},{"objectId":"643bbd5c4097076e1eac9080","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Szkolnicka","documentHash":"f4135555-c237-4af7-8975-5cd90b48babf"},{"objectId":"643bbd5c4097076e1eac907f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Mituniewicz-Małek","documentHash":"5be8acdf-1b0f-4257-9b18-712bb1637f80"},{"objectId":"5e7094ef878c28a0473c7565","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Petrykowski","uuid":"4B630FAEE0B0AA0A62A786FCAE24391F1B196DC9D10DD67DA33ED62E1DEEC684DEC1A47B190A5BDEE1AEB5200E472F23C7FE675A7B47915C71E9AE68601F668F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5946-1897","documentHash":"5e9d2c87-cd87-4d49-b520-1a15698a18c6"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a77f","name":"Nina","lastName":"Strzałkowska","uuid":"313CB7F00A75E24B6B745074B5CE1B2BAD9989A1F5EA4987437A420F0635FA4685BDF30972166C85061836E6D4B38F0570CC97B8E939FD6C77EA4440E9C64FB2","orcidId":"0000-0002-5713-2835","documentHash":"302cdef6-27c1-48d9-a77d-4659d9d8f98e"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a0473921f5","name":"MAŁGORZATA","lastName":"ZIARNO","uuid":"B545E3E1D2BBB16806233E4FF7CFD3B4789F2D33C7F94BF6CD7F12FD96D131A43F7678875D4DAB7C68BDB05B10488D911C894703CBFCD8E5B2491AE7DA9CAC88","orcidId":"0000-0001-7445-6375","documentHash":"0351d7a7-0b1d-487f-a357-0028c30fe438"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"643bbd5c4097076e1eac907e","publicUri":"https://www.igbzpan.pl/year-2022-vol-40-no-4","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The viability of probiotic monoculture and quality of goat's and cow's bioyogurt","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bio-yogurts are obtained from milk of various ruminant species (most often cow and goat) and are a rich source of a variety of valuable nutritional compounds and probiotic microorganisms.

Bio-yogurts were produced from raw material obtained from Saanen goats and Holstein Friesian Black and White cows, both kept on the organics farms. Four experimental products were produced: two from goat’s milk: KBJ-L811 (with the YE-L811 yogurt starter culture and probiotics: L. acidophilus LA-5 and B. animalis subsp. lactis BB-12) and KBJ-X16 (the YC-X16 yogurt culture, LA-5 and BB-12) and two analogical cow’s milk variants: BJ-L811 and BJ-X16. The products underwent microbiological, physicochemical, textural and sensory evaluation. The study confirmed that the activity of yogurt and probiotic cultures in goat’s and cow’s products was similar. In the case of yogurt cultures, their viability was min. 8 log (cfu/g). The count of probiotic bacteria was 7.7-8.4 log (cfu/g) for Bifidobacterium sp. and 5.9-7.4 log (cfu/g) for L. acidophilus.

Egg yolks are a bioavailable source of lutein and zeaxanthin. The consumption of these carotenoids has been linked with improved human health. To investigate the impact of dried stevia leaves at 0%, 1% and 2% on the quality variables, the chemical composition and antioxidant content of eggs, the experiment involved 90 Hy-Line Brown laying hens, housed in 30 enriched layer cages, in groups of three from 22 to 26 weeks of age. The impact on the internal qualities of stored eggs was also examined. Yolks from hens fed stevia had an enriched color compared with the controls. At the end of the experiment, the whole egg, without shell, of birds fed 2% stevia had a higher total carotenoid content (p < 0.001) compared with birds fed 1% and 0% stevia, i.e., 5.16 (µg/g), 4.23 (µg/g) and 2.96 (µg/g), respectively. Storage reduced albumen height and increased albumen pH (p < 0.001). Stevia supplementation did not interact (p > 0.05) with storage time among the egg quality variables. Consuming eggs from hens fed stevia may increase carotenoids in human diet."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1418","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646c8cae409707691c4e4f67","646c8cae409707691c4e4f68","646c8cae409707691c4e4f69","646c8cae409707691c4e4f6a","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","646c8cae409707691c4e4f6b","646c8cae409707691c4e4f6c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","issn":"2304-8158","eissn":"2304-8158","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"827d8888-1217-4c9f-a068-b8a2e5756417"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646c8cae409707691c4e4f66","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"10","documentHash":"b4d9e446-bcfe-40d7-bf06-ffad3bce2f8e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["carotenoids","eggs","eye health","human health","laying hens","phytogenic","stevia"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039397106"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"},{"objectId":"5e709365878c28a0473a8ad7","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"KARPIŃSKI","uuid":"4DE7C8EE6F0DBBC7DDFFD9A602E75ED021B0519EA5D21F0F9070CABFB76A349D04291BA6DA3D35D2018376629F620F2FF3656F03333E58D48C48A52D3BD5E4C6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6599-9204","documentHash":"9b0c7d07-5c96-4e80-861c-06e850b493b9"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399193","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Horbańczuk","uuid":"976205AE9A3DD4FA85531EB44854AE0083FBAD6743C6797D800A9669BD6FAED38693031A6C16E0A03AAE6903DEB2CEF4B47FFF137CB5399DCB5BFBCFCFF25343","orcidId":"0000-0002-7561-0941","documentHash":"a9235661-fb2e-4102-b6a6-35060d6414c3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"63eb459d4097075ca50ed2b4","doi":"10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154520","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The International Natural Product Sciences Taskforce (INPST) and the power of Twitter networking exemplified through INPST hashtag analysis.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\nThe development of digital technologies and the evolution of open innovation approaches have enabled the creation of diverse virtual organizations and enterprises coordinating their activities primarily online.

Tail posture and motion have so far mainly been studied in the context of tail biting behaviour. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pigs’ natural behaviour and their tail posture and tail motion. This was studied in a free-range farm in which tail biting is absent. In total 214 pigs of different age categories were observed individually (sows, gilts, boars, and 6-month old pigs) or by group (6-month and 1-year old pigs) for their tail posture, tail motion and behaviour, using live observations and videos obtained by drone. Results showed that a fully curled tail occurred most during locomotion (P < 0.001); and an actively hanging tail occurred more during foraging (P < 0.001), excavation (P = 0.006), feeding (P = 0.017), receipt of agonistic behaviour (P = 0.036), and non-agonistic social interactions (P = 0.046). A fully curled tail (P < 0.001) and a half curled tail (P < 0.005) occurred least in the group of sows. Tail motion was infrequent (6.7% of observations), and involved mainly loosely wagging, which occurred more during locomotion (P = 0.006) and non-agonistic social interactions (P = 0.006). A higher temperature-humidity index increased the probability of half curled tails (P < 0.001) and loose wagging (P < 0.001), while reducing the probability of active (P < 0.001) and passive hanging tails (P = 0.013). These results provide insight into tail posture and tail motion in pigs under semi-natural conditions, showing especially that hanging tails are not primarily associated with tail biting, and that the use of tail postures for welfare assessment should be in consideration with the context in which the animals are kept."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej

and innovative method to collect ideas from numerous contributors with diverse backgrounds. Crowdsourcing from social media like Twitter can be used for generating ideas in a noticeably brief time based on contributions from globally distributed users. The world has been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic in the last several years. Measures to combat the pandemic continue to evolve worldwide, and ideas and opinions on optimal counteraction strategies are of high interest.\n\nObjective: This study aimed to validate the use of Twitter as a crowdsourcing platform in order to gain an understanding of public opinion on what measures can help to end the COVID-19 pandemic faster.\n\nMethods: This cross-sectional study was conducted during the period from December 22, 2021, to February 4, 2022. Tweets were posted by accounts operated by the authors, asking \"How to faster end the COVID-19 pandemic?\" and encouraging the viewers to comment on measures that they perceive would be effective to achieve this goal. The ideas from the users' comments were collected and categorized into two major themes - personal and institutional measures. In the final stage of the campaign, a Twitter poll was conducted to get additional comments and to estimate which of the two groups of measures were perceived to be important amongst Twitter users.\n\nResults: The crowdsourcing campaign generated seventeen suggested measures categorized into two major themes (personal and institutional) that received a total of 1,727 endorsements (supporting comments, retweets, and likes). The poll received a total of 325 votes with 58% of votes underscoring the importance of both personal and institutional measures, 20% favoring personal measures, 11% favoring institutional measures, and 11% of the votes given just out of curiosity to see the vote results.\n\nConclusions: Twitter was utilized successfully for crowdsourcing ideas on strategies how to end the COVID-19 pandemic faster. The results indicate that the Twitter community highly values the significance of both personal responsibility and institutional measures to counteract the pandemic. This study validates the use of Twitter as a primary tool that could be used for crowdsourcing ideas with healthcare significance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646dc08a4097077040485179","646dc08a409707704048517a","646dc08a409707704048517b","646dc08a409707704048517c","646dc08a409707704048517d","646dc08a409707704048517e","646dc08a409707704048517f","646dc08a4097077040485180","646dc08a4097077040485181","646dc08a4097077040485182","646dc08a4097077040485183","646dc08a4097077040485184","646dc08a4097077040485185","646dc08a4097077040485186","646dc08a4097077040485187","646dc08a4097077040485188","646dc08a4097077040485189","646dc08a409707704048518a","646dc08a409707704048518b","646dc08a409707704048518c","646dc08a409707704048518d","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1b2","mniswId":"6847","title":"Frontiers in Medicine","issn":"2296-858X","eissn":"2296-858X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"6c827de0-68f7-433c-bd4c-6f332f60833e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62aa49d04097077935315316","year":"2022","volume":"9","documentHash":"d9f3603d-c619-44d2-9bb1-6ceefd4bb52c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","pandemic","public opinion","social media"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039397122"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646dd47d4097077040499a18","name":"Bairong","lastName":"Shen","documentHash":"4f246b6d-cbd6-4032-8aed-99c1f6a57952"},{"objectId":"646dd47d4097077040499a17","name":"Rajeev K","lastName":"Singla","documentHash":"d34c610b-3e28-4b8f-b96a-bb74e14e1eb8"},{"objectId":"646dd47d4097077040499a16","name":"Mojca","lastName":"Hribersek","documentHash":"e991128e-cb1e-4cda-b3bf-da34ef8a2f97"},{"objectId":"646dd47d4097077040499a15","name":"Chayan","lastName":"Baidya","documentHash":"ebddb51b-11ca-41fb-9a0a-a7c118c9c95c"},{"objectId":"646dd47d4097077040499a14","name":"Himel","lastName":"Mondal","documentHash":"c8f2dff0-5f36-4262-8810-313690deba86"},{"objectId":"646dd47d4097077040499a13","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Selim","documentHash":"548707cb-ae6e-47a8-ba7a-3a8508ffac28"},{"objectId":"646dd47d4097077040499a12","name":"Purab K","lastName":"Modak","documentHash":"e459c0d2-158e-427e-b6f0-2f652b373da6"},{"objectId":"646dd47d4097077040499a11","name":"Shaikat","lastName":"Mondal","documentHash":"73754ad3-112d-43f3-988d-479449de46a5"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","name":"Atanas","lastName":"Atanasov","uuid":"5ADD3E6696341D1673566A9F38631AD2B57E6554FB744D362C78CB66A5A93B4C7D6D62F4209937FA3920DDA777A295D590011678ABC746AD4A40C5F368D13EBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2545-0967","documentHash":"d32d8b3b-5181-472d-9d13-a6a9306c8e3a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646dd47d4097077040499a0f","doi":"10.7759/cureus.28767","publicUri":"https://www.cureus.com/articles/111816-twitter-poll-as-a-medium-for-questionnaire-based-health-survey-an-experience-of-a-pilot-study-on-the-preference-of-systems-of-medicine-for-various-health-conditions","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Twitter Poll as a Medium for Questionnaire-Based Health Survey: An Experience of a Pilot Study on the Preference of Systems of Medicine for Various Health Conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background The easy accessibility of smartphones and internet connections enables people to stay virtually connected to communities via social media. However, social media is also being explored for health care education and dissemination of health-related information. Twitter (Twitter, Inc., San Francisco, California) is one of the popular social media used for spreading health-related information. Twitter enables users to create polls to get opinions from their users. The Twitter poll is a less-explored avenue for health surveys. Objective In this pilot study, we aimed to explore the feasibility of conducting a questionnaire-based health survey (on the preference of different systems of medicine for the treatment of various health problems) as a Twitter poll. Methods This observational study was conducted on Twitter for five consecutive days starting from May 31, 2021. We posted five Twitter polls, one poll each day, for five days in a #INPST unique Twitter campaign. Preferences on the use of modern medicine, traditional medicine, a combination of these two systems, and self-medication were collected on five health conditions. We collected the data from the landing poll page and Tweet Analytics (insight about the engagement of tweets provided free by Twitter). The Chi-square test, binomial test, and one-way Analysis of Variance were used to compare data, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to find a correlation between categorical variables. Results We had a mean 4358.6±590.3 poll reach with the engagement of 108.2±36.87 Twitter users and 67.6±28.06 votes. Most of the responses were received on the first day of posting the poll. The participation then gradually decreased. Modern medicine was the first choice for emergency medical care (85.1%, P <0.0001), treatment of cancer (43.6%, P <0.0001), and sexual disorder or transmitted diseases (48.9%, P <0.0001). Traditional medicine was the first choice (37.5%, P = 0.63) for the treatment of common illnesses, and a combination of modern and traditional medicine was the first choice (37.5%, P = 0.01) for the treatment of chronic diseases. Conclusion A medical survey with short questions with a maximum of four response options can be conducted on Twitter. Survey results can be obtained without any third-party analytic service. The response rate is highest on the first day and participation may decrease when multiple polls are posted within a Twitter campaign. Preference for systems of medicine found in this study can be used for designing large-scale surveys in the future."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646dd47d4097077040499a11","646dd47d4097077040499a12","646dd47d4097077040499a13","646dd47d4097077040499a14","646dd47d4097077040499a15","646dd47d4097077040499a16","646dd47d4097077040499a17","646dd47d4097077040499a18","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ed2a","mniswId":"27342","title":"Cureus","issn":"2168-8184","eissn":"2168-8184","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"976c14f4-9ca4-4c07-a3ed-0f58fc6b9b6b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646dd47d4097077040499a10","year":"2022","documentHash":"e1e00948-8ab9-4984-a476-a887cecd874b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["health survey","patient opinion;","poll","primary care education","public opinion","questionnaire","social media platform;","survey","survey methodology","twitter"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039397125"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646b734c409707633dfeaf0b","name":"Fabrice","lastName":"Reigner","documentHash":"b8c95cb7-210e-4a10-abe7-92097ee8608f"},{"objectId":"646b734c409707633dfeaf0a","name":"Céline","lastName":"Parias","documentHash":"a0619aec-f26b-4753-9531-0717e2e49edd"},{"objectId":"646b734c409707633dfeaf09","name":"Frédéric","lastName":"Lévy","documentHash":"4980d072-8610-42df-97be-56a1c5975fba"},{"objectId":"646b734c409707633dfeaf08","name":"Léa","lastName":"Lansade","documentHash":"c9ecb0de-0349-49d5-b3e5-a079922d559a"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a047399792","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Górecka-Bruzda","uuid":"72F07386064F04FF4EAD4A68E0477EB2820848B4A1DA26E3EF48F8D21F704F6E420674366B7C4BA7D63499E807F6FA5DE0CB5CACD4982E5B9255599DE0881524","orcidId":"0000-0002-2770-2278","documentHash":"12a96cce-0775-4b1e-a45d-8a702583a7c3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"OCTOBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"646b734c409707633dfeaf06","doi":"10.1016/j.animal.2022.100636","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1751731122001938?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Weaned horses, especially females, still prefer their dam after five months of separation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Under natural conditions, foals stop nursing from their dam at approximately-9 months old, but their bond persists until 1.5-2.5 years of age. In contrast, in horse breeding, foals are generally artificially weaned and totally separated from their dam at 5-7 months. However, it is not known whether the bond between the dam and her foal is maintained after artificial weaning. The aim of this study was (1) to assess whether foals still recognise and prefer their dam over other familiar mares several months after weaning and (2) to evaluate whether the preference for the dam is more pronounced in fillies or colts. Fifteen fillies and 19 colts were weaned at the age of 7 months old (complete separation from the mother). At the age of one year (i.e., 5 months after the separation), they underwent a test evaluating their preference for their dam or a familiar mare from their natal group. Significantly more foals first approached their dam; they also sniffed and tended to look more often at her. This finding indicates that artificially weaned horses remember and still exhibit a preference for their dam, suggesting that the bond persists even after 5 months of separation. Moreover, fillies exhibited a stronger preference for both mares than colts: they looked at them more frequently, sniffed them for a longer duration and spent more time in proximity to both mares than colts. This suggests that fillies generally have an even stronger attachment to their dam as well as to other mares from their natal group. This study calls into question the practice of artificial weaning at 5-7 months of age."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a047399792"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"100636","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646b734c409707633dfeaf08","646b734c409707633dfeaf09","646b734c409707633dfeaf0a","646b734c409707633dfeaf0b","5e7092a1878c28a047399792"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547702a","mniswId":"1135","title":"Animal.","issn":"1751-7311","eissn":"1751-732X","documentHash":"75e7d827-d0e7-4aaa-99e6-ce35edc7b49b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646b734c409707633dfeaf07","year":"2022","volume":"16","number":"10","documentHash":"c46cb6a9-2955-4bdd-8eb5-c37d2562f1ed"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Individual recognition","Juvenile behaviour","Mare-foal bond","Sex difference","Social support"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039397128"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658423584097076c14c00d8e","name":"Stephan","lastName":"Von Haehling","documentHash":"4c28e36b-40f4-46de-b086-5ffff722775a"},{"objectId":"658423584097076c14c00d8d","name":"G.B.

Depression prevalence is estimated to be around 4 % of the whole world population. Several drugs are used to treat depression by focusing on regulating the levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and monoamine. However, the immune cells (e.g., CD4+T cells) interaction with the CNS during depression is often neglected.     Methods: To investigate the role of CD4+ T cells in depression, we adoptively transferred naïve CD4+ T cells into Rag1-/- mice. We investigated the presence of CD4+ T cells in the brain and their relationship to change in behavior. We also investigated the symptoms of brain inflammation by exploring CD4+ T cells migration effect on astrocytes and neurons through MRI and IHC  Results: We  found  that  CD4+  T  cells  infiltration  of  the  brain  is  directly  correlated  to depression-like behavior in mice including social avoidance, higher preference for darkness, and loss of motivation for exploration as well as weight loss. However, mice's memory function Eur. J. Immunol. 2022. 52(Suppl. 1): 1–480 Abstracts   DOI: 10.1002/eji.202270100 © 2022 The Authors. European Journal of Immunology  © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH                                262 seemed  to  be  intact.  The  depression-like  behavior  is  also  associated  with  hypothalamic astrogliosis, demyelination, and lesion-like structures. The infiltration of CD4+ T cells seems to be confined to the hypothalamus as CD4+ T cells infiltration of other parts of the brain such as hippocampus, cortex and the cerebellum was minimal. Interestingly, we found that CD4+ T cells that successfully migrated to the brain are mostly Th17 RoRgt+. These cells are producing proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFa and IFNg as well as IL17F which in turn seem to be directly over-activating astrocytes.   Conclusions: Our results indicate that Th17 infiltration of the hypothalamus is directly related to depression and weight loss in mice. Targeting Th17 infiltration of the brain during depression can decrease symptoms and increase quality of life"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"52","issue":"S1","pagesFromTo":"1-480","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["612d94299543c7051ff01b28"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477bb8","mniswId":"6188","title":"European Journal of Immunology","issn":"0014-2980","eissn":"1521-4141","documentHash":"7bf6be0a-8c12-481e-a0bf-46d55c520fd1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"663b66854097070c4ce6c01c","year":"2022","volume":"52","number":"S1","documentHash":"60831a2c-33f0-4b99-bdbc-7130e65cb644"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Depression; CD4+ T cells; Th17 cells"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039397198"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663c78014097071b7581fc9e","name":"James P","lastName":"Higham","documentHash":"51caabb6-2b64-4838-905e-389447833255"},{"objectId":"663c78014097071b7581fc9d","name":"Zhou","lastName":"Qi Hai","documentHash":"6188e123-5261-4ca2-ace8-22b327b622da"},{"objectId":"663c78014097071b7581fc9c","name":"Suchinda","lastName":"Malaivijitnond","documentHash":"10c1da87-d4cf-47ce-a7e0-72993b0cb60c"},{"objectId":"663c78014097071b7581fc9b","name":"Asmita","lastName":"Sengupta","documentHash":"168eec1c-fbd7-4ce4-af7c-7ece5fb79610"},{"objectId":"663c78014097071b7581fc9a","name":"Mewa","lastName":"Singh","documentHash":"06cb801c-abaa-4101-b7e7-5ea169ef4f90"},{"objectId":"663c78014097071b7581fc99","name":"Noah","lastName":"Snyder-Mackler","documentHash":"be8c5a56-2a5d-4484-b20e-e7f0aed8ac35"},{"objectId":"663c78014097071b7581fc98","name":"Lauren JN","lastName":"Brent","documentHash":"ae51a76a-e192-4c78-aaef-0eb2ba3f9d7b"},{"objectId":"663c78014097071b7581fc97","name":"Eve B","lastName":"Cooper","documentHash":"659cb520-5622-4f4f-89e6-96dd26e4b7dd"},{"objectId":"623159b87523402df092adf8","name":"Sunil","lastName":"Khatiwada","uuid":"BB8AD6E22420141CDE9C3C859C1FB6D7F228E68078639B36B0385EC905B6ED8F747BC7B2C4185339A2AD4567FAE41CDD9ED45BE33DFEDB6CC2737D63E6D0600D","documentHash":"dd5b6c12-2b96-4689-8b47-0181ede7697a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"663c78014097071b7581fc96","doi":"10.7554/elife.78169","publicUri":"https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/78169/elife-78169-v3.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The rhesus macaque as a success story of the Anthropocene","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Of all the non-human primate species studied by researchers, the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is likely the most widely used across biological disciplines.

When it concerns issues as complex and universal as COVID-19, the public should also have a say in how to deal with managing its impact.\n\nDESIGN: In a widely distributed online questionnaire, members of the Austrian public were invited to contribute experiences, ideas and opinions on the level of risk they were willing to accept regarding COVID-19. The huge variety of responses were categorised by social scientists into groups used in a workshop to draw up recommendations for responding to future challenges to the healthcare system from an interdisciplinary point of view.\n\nRESULTS: The results of the survey indicated that while members of the public are primarily afraid of illnesses caused by COVID-19, they also fear the psychological burden and effects at the societal level.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our study has shown that there is a significant public desire to have a say in issues which directly impact citizens."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej

gastrointestinal digestion was investigated. Lipid oxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive\r\nsubstances and hexanal) and protein oxidation (protein carbonyl compounds) were evaluated in\r\nboth jerky and gastrointestinal digests. Lower lipid oxidation was observed in jerky with flavor\r\nadditives. The susceptibility to oxidation was the highest in ostrich, lower in beef and the lowest in\r\nchicken jerky. Nine months storage time increased both lipid and protein oxidation products levels,further increased by the in vitro digestion of jerky. We showed, that shelf-life of jerky depends on\r\nthe species while some additives (tomato-pepper mixture) that can inhibit the oxidation process in\r\njerky may not warrant their antioxidant effect

increased level of NO, which could contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC) development. We hypothesized that the potential influence of the NOS2 gene polymorphism on cancer development may vary between right-sided and left-sided colon cancers, and rectal cancers. The aim of this study was to determine the rs2297518 polymorphism influence on colorectal cancer development with regard to tumor localization. Methods: This case–control study included 199 patients with CRC and 120 controls. The qPCR endpoint genotyping was conducted using the TaqMan® genotyping assay. Results: This study revealed significant differences in tumor characteristic and in the minor alelle A frequency in the NOS2 genotype between colorectal cancers with different localizations. The mucinous adenocarcinoma was diagnosed significantly more often in right-sided cancers than in left-sided (30.6% vs. 10.9%, p = 0.009) and rectal cancers (30.6% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.0003). The minor allele A of the NOS2 genotype was observed more frequently in right-sided cancers than in left-sided cancers (44.9% vs. 23.1%, p = 0.0137) and more frequently in rectal cancers than in left-sided cancers (40.0% vs. 23.1%, p = 0.0285). Conclusions: In conclusion, the results support the hypothesis that the SNP rs2297518 of the NOS2 gene influences colorectal cancer development with regard to tumor localization."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ffd60e0085dcb6be6b60b1c","5e70928c878c28a047397bb1","5e70928e878c28a047397cd3","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d24","5e709409878c28a0473b53cd","5e70928c878c28a047397c03","5e70947f878c28a0473be649"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a047399828"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"[1-11], [poz.] 937","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928e878c28a047397cd3","5e70928c878c28a047397c03","65e023d94097072bd3724c52","5e709409878c28a0473b53cd","615e5ba875234017e04fde16","65e023d94097072bd3724c53","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d24","5e70947f878c28a0473be649","5ffd60e0085dcb6be6b60b1c","5ffedfaa085dcb0e357dcf10","5e70928c878c28a047397bb1","5e7092a1878c28a047399828"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","issn":"2077-0383","eissn":"2077-0383","documentHash":"befa56e5-391b-4865-9035-19691faf400b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ca11fd4097071d948603b4","year":"2024","volume":"13","number":"4","documentHash":"ae9c57b3-f946-4822-9d30-38c66a5ab433"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["colorectal cancer","NOS2","gene polymorphism right-sided CRC","left-sided CRC"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748646939435"}]
