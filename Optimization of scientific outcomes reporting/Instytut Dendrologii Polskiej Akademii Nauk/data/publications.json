Thus, it has a more severe impact on species  regeneration and survival in ash optimal sites. We aimed to investigate the joint effects of seed dispersal limi\u0002tation triggered by the distance from seed source, as well as soil fertility, browsing, and understory vegetation on  ash natural regeneration in optimal and neighboring suboptimal sites. We examined ash regeneration within 40  circular plots (25 m2 ) in Western Poland along soil fertility gradient and increasing distance from seed source  (0–100 m). We confirmed the seed dispersal limitation of ash regeneration. We found that the increase of dis\u0002tance from seed source increases ash natural regeneration (both of <0.6 and 0.6–1.3 m height) survival by  escaping distance-dependent mortality, referring to the Janzen-Connell effect. Moreover, soil drivers i.e.  groundwater table level, CaCO3, and soil C:N influenced ash regeneration damage rate. Furthermore, we indi\u0002cated that light availability can enhance ash regeneration. We found the highest browsing in sites with the  highest ash natural regeneration density. Understory species composition was related to ash regeneration den\u0002sity, browsing, and damage proportion, indicating that species typical of mesic broadleaved forests can be  considered as positive indicators of the ash regeneration niche. In conclusion, we state that suboptimal sites can  act as refugees for ash, helping this species to persist over ash dieback. Therefore, we recommend broadening the  scope of ash conservation and silviculture into suboptimal sites, that can host ash regeneration and allow it to  emerge and reproduce. Such sites in the neighborhood of typical ash sites damaged by H. fraxineus can in the  future serve as seed sources for forest regeneration and improve the resilience of the forest ecosystem."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ee","621ee4b97523402df08b9716"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"505","pagesFromTo":"119870","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ee","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","621ee4b97523402df08b9716"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d2e","mniswId":"6734","title":"FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","issn":"0378-1127","documentHash":"37771705-8204-4376-a5d9-e8d43ad82b3e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d34d212467f0718b309f26","year":"2022","volume":"505","documentHash":"b279e5fc-4bf9-4469-8a81-681ec5a64277"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057759788"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709494878c28a0473bfd3f","name":"Roma","lastName":"Żytkowiak","uuid":"A44BEC0B796E48764FC89E8E246CD796D020543332510113E9AD0B31C2FB5D084D044D105657E66CE30DD56552D989C97C40415D750DE788725FF16CB4FFAEBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-1024-8694","documentHash":"76b17a0a-a1d2-4bcd-845d-9c9667f178fa"},{"objectId":"5e7092ef878c28a04739f7a8","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wyka","uuid":"F1163110C4C1FA008A8B3F5B027151823CE1D2D77B56408C5FC79A44EDE703D0F7458D37C2F395EF0571BD76DA43FA228A49DCAAAEDD6F1495FD82589E70161E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0569-8009","documentHash":"1ea71ff9-b0d1-43ff-9e6e-a371c123f48e"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393ea0","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Oleksyn","uuid":"10DCBA1017E5DA2D82D4B1489A20BCD8C67DA7F426AA86D23FCDBB0058B106C67A382D478349DB38528D408DAAF00BA26F56FCD1A2D709C8E2F44834B15490DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6576-3258","documentHash":"0567df2b-4cbc-44fa-a22c-dd84c7f8ac42"}],"objectId":"61e57f2e2467f0034f1127fb","doi":"10.1007/s11120-022-00898-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11120-022-00898-8.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Anatomical adjustment of mature leaves of sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) to increased irradiance","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Trees regenerating in the understory respond to increased availability of light caused by gap formation by undergoing a range of morphological and physiological adjustments. These adjustments include the production of thick, sun-type leaves containing thicker mesophyll and longer palisade cells than in shade-type leaves. We asked whether in the shade-regenerating tree Acer pseudoplatanus, the increase in leaf thickness and expansion of leaf tissues are possible also in leaves that had been fully formed prior to the increase in irradiance, a response reported so far only for a handful of species. We acclimated potted seedlings to eight levels (from 1 to 100%) of solar irradiance and, in late summer, transferred a subset of them to full sunlight. Within 30 days, the shaded leaves increased leaf mass per area and became thicker mostly due to elongation of palisade cells, except for the most shaded individuals which sufered irreversible photo-oxidative damage. This anatomical acclimation was accompanied by partial degradation of chlorophyll and a transient decline in photosynthetic efciency of PSII (Fv/FM). These efects were related to the degree of pre-shading. The Fv/FM recovered substantially within the re-acclimation period. However, leaves of transferred plants were shed signifcantly earlier in the fall, indicating that the acclimation was not fully efective. These results show that A. pseudoplatanus is one of the few known species in which mature leaves may re-acclimate anatomically to increased irradiance. This may be a potentially important mechanism enhancing utilization of gaps created during the growing season."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","uid":"bPE2PjbeOl7yC2KHqaQECkQ","uuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","name":"Uniwersytet im.

Until recently, there has been no simple and effective method to determine the total terpenoid content with satisfactory repeatability and sensitivity. The procedure proposed by Ghorai et al. (2012) requires the use of fresh plant material. That may be problematic when experimental units are located far from a laboratory. Our goals were to optimize the procedure, and to find the threshold of misestimation using the procedure adjusted to work with dried material. Needles of Pinus sylvestris were used to test the effect of changes in drying, grinding, storage, and extraction on determined total terpenoid content. All applied changes in material storage and grinding decreased the quantity of the terpenoids in needles. Only air-dried and ball-milled material produced similar results to those obtained with fresh material – can be recommended if the fresh material unattainable. Air-dried material may be stored for up to three months, but it resulted in greater variation and then greater sample size is needed. Lower sample mass and solvent volume have no impact on accuracy. Shorter extraction time, oven-drying or microwaving leads to unreliability of measurements."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f1","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f6","5e709347878c28a0473a643e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709256878c28a047393e57","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f6","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8e4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"314","pagesFromTo":"111090","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f6","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f1","5e709347878c28a0473a643e","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8e4","5e709256878c28a047393e57"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792cf","mniswId":"16212","title":"Plant Science","issn":"0168-9452","documentHash":"00e1c18b-1b11-442e-98b1-3221305d859e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e586252467f0034f1194c9","year":"2022","volume":"314","documentHash":"9a1edfef-47dd-4d63-b1ca-d9158b4d4585"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058018655"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61e2fc622467f035b526a781","name":"Asma","lastName":"Taib","orcidId":"0000-0001-9216-5045","documentHash":"4f87f432-6c40-4f15-b8b4-eeb9b9c56df5"},{"objectId":"609badcb9543c73526c48ddc","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Walas","uuid":"E1487E209BFE1859BC19AE81536E570F7441462D7640828646C2A178167548E2FAB950B628D6E3175BF4B9F287E730921BE7B613AC07554C874A38EDD7300CA8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4060-9801","documentHash":"3b7fa0ae-0321-4b2a-ad87-b43027d64501"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"61e2fc622467f035b526a77e","doi":"10.1007/s10661-021-09707-6","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09707-6","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Environmental regionalization and endemic plant distribution in the Maghreb","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Clustering methods based on environmental variables are useful in the planning of conservation strategies for species and ecosystems. However, there is a lack of work on the regionalization of the vast space of North Africa and the distribution of plant species. The current lists of endemic plants are focused mostly on an occurrence at the country level and not on regions with different conditions. The aim of this work was to lay out an environmental scheme for northwest Africa and to collect data about the occurrence of endemic plants in this area. Clustering with 12 of 33 tested environmental rasters was performed to divide the Maghreb into environmental clusters. Then, a list of 1618 endemic plant taxa (1243 species and 375 subspecies) was prepared and their distribution in estimated environmental clusters was examined. Eleven clusters with different conditions were estimated. The main drivers of regionalization were temperature amplitude, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of the warmest quarter. According to the occurrence of endemic plants, northwest Africa may be divided into three zones: Atlas, Mediterranean (two environmental clusters), and southern zone (eight environmental clusters). The presented results provide a good basis for understanding the spatial patterns of the Maghreb, including its environment and species diversity. A designed list of endemic plant species together with environmental data may facilitate the planning of future research in north Africa and arranging methods of biodiversity protection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["609badcb9543c73526c48ddc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"194","issue":"2","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61e2fc622467f035b526a781","609badcb9543c73526c48ddc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b0b","mniswId":"5832","title":"Environmental Monitoring and Assessment","issn":"0167-6369","eissn":"1573-2959","documentHash":"5638a9db-ba18-46d2-a59e-9fa77e068298"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e2fc622467f035b526a783","year":"2022","volume":"194","number":"2","documentHash":"037ef233-4c01-497a-98b7-1ac0e38816f9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058056200"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709474878c28a0473bd695","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Staszak","uuid":"07E706761E991BE12E98193E438F5F550E529FE11BD70DFB5A2C5DEBFD79809203F3678A9FB7BA5C2C2C24AB5EE898ECA458F479573EFB5CF060B8ABE206C885","orcidId":"0000-0002-7913-3716","documentHash":"f5ba2307-81ab-4386-862b-bec07759d73a"},{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b7759","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kijowska-Oberc","uuid":"AFA5CA4E3E220E48F2421A1E1115D8B19FC9172D41060064D14FA67148D1FB28EB068A935FD82213BCB4126483B44E5388DEE49FEFEAE66B73EEC859287382A1","documentHash":"480a960f-6d29-408a-8200-dbbdeaf3668c"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5903","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Hazubska-Przybył","uuid":"4FE5C744970E7ECB31C715F6AFDFDB4CE9010B1DB7FA4C50E6FBFFF63409DC22C0B65785C9B057C96B6D0DF5A9D7B748F98DD77CAFB46760F851FBAAEB56AF6B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4553-1588","documentHash":"b6be9b37-b924-4ca9-bfc6-c30f56dc092e"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8fc","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"AA2B99C3C5C95922E6B90B6A0077115CA183DD0020FCFE2EB69AC82808F79A087D0D6EC86BBE59046B257EAD936A69D4AD13E9C95245D3A25DF6B60E5508FF03","orcidId":"0000-0002-4297-5741","documentHash":"f7710694-9645-4c8d-a52f-053e3136073e"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394a38","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Ratajczak","uuid":"697FF082D291F06AA3859F78E0EC87A3B084B3435985CD665D0ED090BCD75E40FB3CD6909C0D749206AD4743DAAF98856265C3A7E7F7E3E5EE358B50EF089EC6","orcidId":"0000-0003-2710-4638","documentHash":"cac17ac6-c01f-41d6-9615-1bd230a14eb8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"61fba4f82467f07d34e57076","doi":"10.3390/f13020155","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/2/155/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Somatic Embryogenesis of Norway Spruce and Scots Pine: Possibility of Application in Modern Forestry","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is an important method for the vegetative propagation of trees.

However, there is still a lack of knowledge on some general patterns of the relationships between litter quality (tree species), microclimate, and structure of soil mite assemblages.\nAims: The study aimed to analyze the impact of climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation) on mesostigmatid mite communities in the litter of 11 tree species through the vegetation season.\nMethods: The experiment tested litter decomposition of 11 different tree species (693 litterbags), for seven consecutive months (April-October) under homogenous Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) canopy monocultures in common garden conditions. Soil mites were extracted in Tullgren funnels.\nResults: Mesostigmatid mite abundance was positively correlated with the temperature of the sampling month and negatively with the temperature of the previous month.

Most nuclear loci showed homogeneous patterns of variation across populations from Spain, Central Europe, Nordic countries and Scotland. Mitochondrial markers did not reveal strong population structure but suggested admixture of samples carrying different mitochondrial lineages in certain parts of the distribution. At nuclear DNA loci, we found high nucleotide polymorphism, generally low population differentiation and weak signals of isolation by distance. Together with the mitochondrial DNA results, these patterns seem most likely to be associated with a process of colonization from multiple sources and efficient gene flow. The results are in line with demographic inference indicating establishment of Central European and Nordic populations before the Last Glacial Maximum and admixture of colonization fronts from mainland Europe in Scottish populations. Coalescent and outlier detection methods identified several genes showing molecular signatures of selection especially in response to temperature variation in ecologically and phenotypically divergent populations.

Data on terrestrial gastropods and environmental variables were collected in 2012–2014 from 25 study plots (14 without pine and 11 with pine) at 14 localities scattered across Wielkopolska province in mid-western Poland. Forty-two species (34 of snails and 8 of slugs) were recorded, with significantly lower numbers of individuals and species in plots with pine. The negative effect of the presence of pine trees was most evident at the level of gastropod abundance. The species composition of gastropod assemblage was also significantly different between plots with and without pine. The symptoms of the assemblage’s reduction, impoverishment and trivialization thus suggested a long-term effect of the introduced pine on natural mesofauna. However, gastropod assemblage was shaped not by one dominating factor, but by a multifactorial combination of interacting variables, particularly related to herbaceous vegetation and to the tree- and shrub layer. Herb layer cover, moisture (reflected in the herbs), fertility (reflected in the herbs), and locally also the amount of calcium in the soil and insolation were found to be significant for the structure of gastropod assemblages. More environmental variables were significant at the sample level (i.e. within forest) than at the plot level (i.e. between forests), which is likely to be due to greater variation in the conditions within a rich forest as opposed to lower variation between forests. This highlighted the importance of using a two-scale approach to understand the conditions affecting gastropod assemblage structure in a habitat that is seemingly homogenous on the macro scale, but diversified and mosaic in the micro scale. The negative effects of pine introduction and the positive significance of the multifactorial combination of habitat factors at the macro- and micro level appear as important guidelines for favourable biodiversity management in the Central European oak-hornbeam forest and in other broadleaved forests."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ffebd42085dcb0e357dcd28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"507","pagesFromTo":"1-13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64098ecd40970770356bebfa","5e709347878c28a0473a64de","5ffebd42085dcb0e357dcd28","5e7092ef878c28a04739f7af"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d2e","mniswId":"6734","title":"Forest Ecology and Management","issn":"0378-1127","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2703f994-3aa7-47af-ab06-be4911580c40"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058138804"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2bfd","name":"Robin","lastName":"Wilgan","uuid":"29076990142B96970CB8B1C129870023B5EAB112BBB9BF28CCF94114C76E5469B812B686E4CB17C8E2B4C86F55F65FDCDA30C9117E95C27FAC26F94FCAE1FC15","orcidId":"0000-0002-3628-5226","documentHash":"a7a6a49e-60fe-4c3e-b25a-d1c90bfed8a7"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a0473949fc","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Leski","uuid":"499B23F9100DF850755C238F9A97C7142B3BA38F5DDDFB0931102B9E1746E46A470F7665C5CA3E4BD70FD941A00BEF3E5864BF947DB02FA5EE70CB8B7506A0B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-4167-5015","documentHash":"0d2af209-8514-4188-bc47-8bacbc29178c"}],"objectId":"62b1b7a1409707603914bdde","doi":"10.3390/f13050676","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/5/676/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Ectomycorrhizal Assemblages of Invasive Quercus rubra L. and Non-Invasive Carya Nutt.

In the acclimatization and invasion of alien tree species, the crucial role is played by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. We tested ECM fungi associated with Quercus rubra and Carya trees that are alien to Europe. Quercus rubra is among the most invasive tree species in Europe, and the Carya species are not considered invasive. Both form ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, and in their native range in North America, coexist in oakhickory forests. Six study stands were located in Kórnik Arboretum: three for Q. rubra and three for Carya trees. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were assessed by molecular identification of ECM roots. We identified 73 ECM fungal taxa of 23 ECM phylogenetic lineages. All identified ECM fungi were native to Europe. Similar richness but different composition of ECM taxa were found on Q. rubra and Carya roots. Phylogenetic lineages /tomentella-thelephora, /russula-lactarius, and /genea-humaria were most abundant on both Carya and Q. rubra roots. Lineages /tuber-helvella and /entoloma were abundant only on Carya, and lineages /pisolithus-scleroderma and /cortinarius were abundant only on Q. rubra roots. Analysis of similarities revealed a significant difference in ectomycorrhizal assemblages between invasive Q. rubra and non-invasive Carya. Highlights: (1) under common garden conditions, ECM taxa richness was similar on Q. rubra and Carya roots; (2) ECM taxa composition differed between invasive Q. rubra and non-invasive Carya; (3) high abundance of long-distance exploration type (lineages from Boletales) was on Q. rubra; and (4) high abundance of short-distance exploration type (e.g., /tuber-helvella) was on Carya."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e4878c28a0473b2bfd","5e709261878c28a0473949fc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"676","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093e4878c28a0473b2bfd","5e709261878c28a0473949fc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d36","mniswId":"6744","title":"Forests","issn":"1999-4907","eissn":"1999-4907","documentHash":"05b7b2b7-d675-43a7-91dd-8446464e53a5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62a87c2640970742eeda63d1","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"5","documentHash":"5a8011af-dfcf-482c-a90c-55fb1a9c0141"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["alien species;","biological invasions;","symbiosis;","fungal ecology;","exploration types;","phylogenetic lineages"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138815"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"602f6cf59543c7410626f48a","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Urbanowski","uuid":"8D3493A1173A7C0E230D41D68007D41D10784A651ABB00C40298297DAC7E3C14AC5F65C7DADE39DE9E93E00A5C5FFC3B10A217C3439456D32EB77A4EFD9304A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-0060-3413","documentHash":"d02faccc-ee56-4c50-aa49-b27bccbf764b"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c026c","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Horodecki","uuid":"7F70C73730CEB5DD7E6741FECB12A65A529DDB966478C8334018A31EFF9EC4C7D25A06154BC87F2F9E8D4FFB6D9B1E6C8CFDD4614F20DCAAABA7EBDD573645DB","orcidId":"0000-0002-7789-8723","documentHash":"4e3b185a-8e56-4c89-b7ea-a9b8d334f566"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6401","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Skorupski","uuid":"E0EE5C17D985DAAD9AA0325653BBD299F401ED3F7DD7AC467EF4E190ABA1364B1CC55B5E46F469A8A1BB3E4DB8749A906D9A0080B8501424732F7AB86D15386C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6752-3576","documentHash":"ed1b8cdf-a6ce-415d-ab8e-e2e5210f9b10"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62e4","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kamczyc","uuid":"5A8BECFFE82BACA911A3F24D5042E5115FCFC61E7AA622528898AE292607A2957269A2F17E26CF7EBE0A31FCB1ADD177A05D7C1F7F1E9D0A3A443E0DF6377DA9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3023-8709","documentHash":"c716a405-daa7-4e6d-a14e-91fcf9219f49"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"03F14E2076FEABB44CC7B743F6FD9B59C0B3CE3F788CFE10E84226C037F019164ED6EE4E61A04DD072E5640611915200DC9689ED62B57A29F869C4D59C6D63FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-0985","documentHash":"002defbf-325a-404d-a301-7cc974eec233"}],"objectId":"62e1071c40970720e7182d29","doi":"10.1002/ldr.4409","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ldr.4409","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Soil mite communities structure (Acari, Mesostigmata) during litter decomposition of seven tree species in pure Scots pine stands (\n            <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>\n            L.) growing on a reclaimed post‐industrial area","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Our knowledge about mites, including mesostigmatids, compared to their significant role in soil-forming processes on post-industrial areas, is currently insufficient.

The highest abundance, almost two times higher compared to other tree species, was recorded in Prunus serotina litter (352.73 ± 105.22 ind.; calculated per 100 g of dry litter mass) and the lowest in Quercus rubra (81.23 ± 9.82 ind.). Furthermore, the lowest richness (2.39 ± 0.07; calculated per sample) and diversity (0.33 ± 0.02; calculated per sample) was recorded in Pinus sylvestris litter, therefore, our results are in contradiction to the home-field advantage assumptions that the “home” litter has a positive effect on soil fauna structure compared to the “foreign” litter.

Little research, however, has examined the consequences of climate change on the distribution patterns of the rich endemic flora of this ecoregion. Climate change can be a major, and undesirable, threat to the various species of the Hyrcanian Forests ecoregion. Therefore, determining suitable habitats for the endemic species from this ecoregion is crucial for their conservation. Populus caspica Bornm, for example, is one of the endemic species of this area. We used the current locations of natural populations of P. caspica to predict the potential habitat range of this species by applying MAXENT algorithm for the present, past (Last Glacial Maximum-Holocene Optimum), and future (2070s) climatic conditions. Our results suggest that the range of the natural habitat of P. caspica expanded during the Holocene, and the present range is wider than that of the past (about 6 ka BP) ages. Climate changes, however, will negatively impact the future habitat range of this species, reducing suitable range by up to 63.46% in the Hyrcanian forests, and only 36.54% of the stable habitats will be retained. These findings can be used to develop an effective conservation strategy for the future. Our models suggest a common priority area in the Eastern part of the Hyrcanian Forests, where the populations of P. caspica are at high risk and should be taken under special protection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ffed5c0085dcb0e357dce7f","609badcb9543c73526c48ddc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ffed5c0085dcb0e357dce7f","62907a56409707780b03aba8","62907a56409707780b03abae","62907a56409707780b03abb1","62907a56409707780b03abb3","609badcb9543c73526c48ddc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547901e","mniswId":"15027","title":"New Forests","issn":"0169-4286","eissn":"1573-5095","documentHash":"5c28153e-8968-4dcd-a851-8ee4ed9ba354"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62907a56409707780b03abb6","year":"2022","documentHash":"f09827b4-f167-4573-9727-aef0ebb95d90"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058169542"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62f49b5840970737355af5dc","name":"Antonio","lastName":"Scarfone","documentHash":"860aa791-e852-4ae4-8ea1-d46e08514629"},{"objectId":"62f49b5840970737355af5db","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Lo Scalzo","documentHash":"59faf800-91d9-4d12-81f7-9c9b5e6c41f8"},{"objectId":"62f49b5840970737355af5d9","name":"Claudio","lastName":"Beni","documentHash":"6f2e6784-9ec1-4562-80ff-e733ba01ba44"},{"objectId":"62f49b5840970737355af5d8","name":"Elio","lastName":"Romano","documentHash":"2a61c8d7-3389-449c-9808-359eb058b2b8"},{"objectId":"62f49b5840970737355af5d7","name":"Simone","lastName":"Bergonzoli","documentHash":"f1e715e0-aa1a-464b-bb09-d4908e757ef0"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c999","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Latterini","uuid":"CACEB340446FB4D6658D01649C4614E61499A61641F167AFFBC6344D44E8291B61B43C50E527B5275449413154134E7EACD6FF854AACC44F14ACA9A37487CF08","orcidId":"0000-0001-7401-8754","documentHash":"7c970a18-8b3d-4160-8189-e32a1aab4e44"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62f49b5840970737355af5d5","doi":"10.3390/insects13080717","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/13/8/717/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Nectar Dynamics and Pollinators Preference in Sunflower","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nectar is a complex biochemical substance secreted with particular rhythm by flower nectaries.\nNectar is the base of a mutualism in which pollinators consume nectar, as food source, and\nare involuntarily responsible for the transport of pollen and pollination.

This research provides further\nunderstanding of the very complex relationship among soil, crop and nectar to support the\ndefinition of agricultural management strategies and reach the optimal nectar composition level for\npollinators in agricultural crops."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"717","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62f49b5840970737355af5d7","62f49b5840970737355af5d8","62f49b5840970737355af5d9","62f49b5840970737355af5db","62f49b5840970737355af5dc","62c796a8752340480571c999"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d59878c28514547c3d4","mniswId":"8403","title":"Insects","issn":"2075-4450","eissn":"2075-4450","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"7c54c228-a3ae-4dee-abb4-5ffeda21746a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62f49b5840970737355af5d6","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"8","documentHash":"ec82d2b5-7b0b-46a0-bc0c-9c266aa9da26"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058176207"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61fce5b02467f02a1f895253","name":"Jingjing","lastName":"Liang","orcidId":"0000-0001-9439-9320","documentHash":"0f51975c-8935-4ba7-8ac1-dadc73213056"},{"objectId":"61fce5b02467f02a1f895252","name":"Irié C.","lastName":"Zo-Bi","documentHash":"49df01e7-c600-4acc-bfca-52c958dd6ec3"},{"objectId":"61fce5b02467f02a1f895251","name":"Zhi-Xin","lastName":"Zhu","documentHash":"7385b25d-cbca-45e2-9a97-625805ff8d69"},{"objectId":"61fce5b02467f02a1f895250","name":"Lise","lastName":"Zemagho","documentHash":"8163d736-5e53-4864-a3ba-d9135dba10c3"},{"objectId":"61fce5b02467f02a1f89524f","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Zawiła-Niedźwiecki","documentHash":"7a9f63a1-909e-4f02-ba11-e863012ea834"},{"objectId":"61fce5b02467f02a1f89524e","name":"Susan K.","lastName":"Wiser","orcidId":"0000-0002-8938-8181","documentHash":"c3edf8d6-d998-427c-8cc0-331e1dee7cb0"},{"objectId":"61fce5b02467f02a1f89524d","name":"Lee J.

The present work aims to evaluate trace elements (Zn, Mn, Cu, Cd, and Pb) along with three sites, Mariout Lake, Abbassa, and River Nile Aswan in Egypt, using Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as bioindicator. The quality assurance, health-risk assessment, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and micronucleus test were performed to investigate the effect of different trace elements on Hsp70 gene level and micronuclei formation. We observed the highest expression of Hsp70 protein band of 70 KD and stress-responsive Hsp70 gene in the liver followed by gills of Nile tilapia caught from Mariout and Abbassa, but the lowest expression was in Nile tilapia caught from Aswan. Obvious micronuclei were observed under the microscope in erythrocytes, and their number was gradually decreased in the following manner: Mariout > Abbassa > Aswan. Noticeably, Cu, Zn, and Mn contents were low. Still, Pb and Cd contents were higher than the toxicity level recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), The World Health Organization (WHO), and the European Commission (EC). These results showed that Hsp70's appearance at the two levels of mRNA and protein is an effective indicator for aquatic pollution besides the aberration at the chromosome level represented in the micronucleus test. Furthermore, these results showed that Nile tilapia of the Aswan region had comparatively low trace elements contamination and were suitable for consumption."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61d6623975234056c07ce8fd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62b1b9ad409707603914d3c1","62b1b9ad409707603914d3c2","62b1b9ad409707603914d3c3","62b1b9ad409707603914d3c4","62b1b9ad409707603914d3c5","62b1b9ad409707603914d3c6","62b1b9ad409707603914d3c7","62b1b9ad409707603914d3c8","62b1b9ad409707603914d3c9","61d6623975234056c07ce8fd","62b1b9ad409707603914d3cb","62b1b9ad409707603914d3cc","62b1b9ad409707603914d3cd","62b1b9ad409707603914d3ce"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb3","mniswId":"22511","title":"Frontiers in Veterinary Science","issn":"2297-1769","eissn":"2297-1769","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"7aca7674-d53a-406a-bc77-ca524899ec80"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b1b9ad409707603914d3d0","year":"2022","volume":"9","documentHash":"37d85265-e4ae-4435-bdb5-924e01d73ebc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["trace elements,","genotoxicity,","Cd,","Pb,","qPCR,","SDS-PAGE,","Nile tilapia"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058182364"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62b1a521409707603913e15c","name":"Patrice","lastName":"Meimoun","orcidId":"0000-0002-7027-6075","documentHash":"a13380b4-0ac0-495e-abe2-75f1cc328f47"},{"objectId":"62b1a521409707603913e15b","name":"Christophe","lastName":"Bailly","orcidId":"0000-0002-5878-9249","documentHash":"01c87d87-6123-4be7-90c8-3e12c726a4e8"},{"objectId":"62b1a521409707603913e15a","name":"Dominique","lastName":"Job","documentHash":"3b64df3c-14c1-4bcc-b504-44eadf6a68f3"},{"objectId":"62b1a521409707603913e159","name":"Benoît","lastName":"Valot","documentHash":"a313a9c4-d501-49c6-a14f-b089572632ad"},{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af520","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kalemba","uuid":"950BDF2DA3FCB4FC8AB0FEF1021CEBE30A717BD1EA3C5A619966773ABF55FD9A1D13BBC971390D54EC7B15067DA295F3AC436861838B88A192F084ED913608CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-0092-0339","documentHash":"10e98ccc-ffee-4aa9-8925-724dc30f36bc"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62b1a521409707603913e156","doi":"10.3390/plants11040569","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/11/4/569/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Are Methionine Sulfoxide-Containing Proteins Related to Seed Longevity? A Case Study of Arabidopsis thaliana Dry Mature Seeds Using Cyanogen Bromide Attack and Two-Dimensional-Diagonal Electrophoresis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In recent years, several reports pointed out the role of protein oxidation in seed longevity, notably regarding the oxidation of methionine (Met) residues to methionine sulfoxide (MetO) in proteins. To further consider this question, we present a handy proteomic method based on the use of two-dimensional diagonal electrophoresis (2Dd) and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage, which we refer to as 2Dd-CNBr. CNBr treatment of proteins causes the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of reduced Met residues. However, Met oxidation causes a lack of cleavage, thus modifying the electrophoretic mobility of CNBr-induced peptides. This approach was first validated using bovine serum albumin as a model protein, which confirmed the possibility of distinguishing between oxidized and non-oxidized forms of Met-containing peptides in gels. Then, the 2Dd-CNBr method was applied to the Arabidopsis thaliana seed protein extract in a control (non-oxidized) condition and in an oxidized one (as obtained following hypochlorous acid treatment). Twenty-four oxidized Met residues in 19 proteins identified by mass spectrometry were found to be surface exposed in these proteins. In the three-dimensional environment of the oxidized Met, we detected amino acid residues that could be converted by oxidation (carbonylation) or by phosphorylation, suggesting a possible interplay between Met oxidation and the other protein modifications. The identification of the proteins oxidatively modified in Met residues revealed the finding that MetO-containing proteins are related to seed longevity. Based on these results, we suggest that the method presently described also has the potential for wider applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b1878c28a0473af520"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"569","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b1878c28a0473af520","62b1a521409707603913e159","62b1a521409707603913e15a","62b1a521409707603913e15b","62b1a521409707603913e15c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547e776","mniswId":"25607","title":"Plants","issn":"2223-7747","eissn":"2223-7747","documentHash":"1dfd0cba-d999-4b6a-8e4c-bc36d6d0afb5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b1a522409707603913e15e","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"4","documentHash":"d3dfbba8-3768-49bb-9cb8-961b72ba7490"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["methionine sulfoxide;","mass spectrometry;","protein modification;","redox proteomics;","two-dimensional diagonal electrophoresis;","seed viability","oxidative stress;","post-translational modifications;"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058182528"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"631092b2409707291a613661","name":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Picchio","documentHash":"c31ed4d0-3d00-4973-996d-0ae254be0b5d"},{"objectId":"631092b2409707291a613660","name":"Rachele","lastName":"Venanzi","documentHash":"ed7d3743-9085-48c4-a91a-5f7a8b86b02c"},{"objectId":"631092b2409707291a61365f","name":"Angela","lastName":"Lo Monaco","documentHash":"9acdfc43-8642-4063-b2dc-ad92cfe148eb"},{"objectId":"631092b2409707291a61365d","name":"Sättar","lastName":"Ezzati","documentHash":"3b639e47-d8e0-41d2-bfb7-5840465e61f3"},{"objectId":"631092b2409707291a61365c","name":"Farzam","lastName":"Tavankar","documentHash":"a7f91b69-7a61-4f93-a8e4-93d2ca0bfc3f"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c999","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Latterini","uuid":"CACEB340446FB4D6658D01649C4614E61499A61641F167AFFBC6344D44E8291B61B43C50E527B5275449413154134E7EACD6FF854AACC44F14ACA9A37487CF08","orcidId":"0000-0001-7401-8754","documentHash":"7c970a18-8b3d-4160-8189-e32a1aab4e44"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"631092b2409707291a61365a","doi":"10.3390/f13091393","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/9/1393/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Assessment of Wound Recovery and Radial Growth 10 Years after Forest Operations in Hardwood Stands","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Damage to the residual stand caused by forest operations can have detrimental impacts on the biological processes of stand growth. This study shows the details from monitoring damages related to manual motor ground-based timber operations in a mountain mixed hardwood forest. The harvesting system was cut-to-length, and logs were extracted by wheeled cable-skidders. Data were collected from the remaining trees immediately after logging and 10 years after the logging session. The parameters assessed included stem injury, radial growth increment and wound healing rate for five hardwood species of commercial interest. The number of injured trees represented 15% of the residual stand, 23% of the wounds were related to the felling operation and 76% to extraction. Wound height, wound size and damage to bark, due to felling, were larger than those in extraction, while wound width and damages to cambium and wood caused by extraction were larger than those triggered by felling. Ten years after harvesting, average longitudinal and radial growth increments were reduced by 38% and 24%, respectively. Wound healing rates ranged from 12.90 mm yr−1 for extraction wounds to 19.70 mm yr−1 for felling ones within 10 years. On average 73% of all wounds were still unrecovered and 17% of these were decayed, while only 10% were fully healed within a 10-year recovery period. The analysis showed that the best recovering performance among damaged trees was mostly achieved in shade-intolerant species with a diameter less than 40 cm, located in the dominant canopy layer with a wound size smaller than 100 cm2. In addition to the significant effect on log quality, the ecological longevity of residual trees has major implications for pre-planning harvesting operations that can preserve the quality and value of residual trees. Understanding the damage inflicted upon residual trees is essential to reduce economic losses, improve planning of harvest operations and, ultimately, ensure a sustainable harvest of mixed hardwood stands in mountain regions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1393","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["631092b2409707291a61365c","631092b2409707291a61365d","62c796a8752340480571c999","631092b2409707291a61365f","631092b2409707291a613660","631092b2409707291a613661"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d36","mniswId":"6744","title":"Forests","issn":"1999-4907","eissn":"1999-4907","documentHash":"05b7b2b7-d675-43a7-91dd-8446464e53a5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"631092b2409707291a61365b","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"9","documentHash":"2911b69a-11fe-4aa1-aae4-d066321d2c97"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cable skidder;","diameter growth;","residual tree;","selective harvesting;","wound recovery"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199830"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c027b","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Mąderek","uuid":"BD0806AFD934334B1CD36D6A1468AE9FD54EF427A50EEEA6DD1CF05D5B660765574F461A5EB494F300911CBD24537A2F3DEAC346C348E1CECD37F754B4CBE3B3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3933-000X","documentHash":"ea274d0c-001a-4ef9-89b7-6b673200cdc4"},{"objectId":"5e709494878c28a0473bfd1f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Pers-Kamczyc","uuid":"D83281E557065B739F360EA976B0E2227CB54250BE0FFC7CD59C4845F03631C4BAB52892DD11A2827CB1337E7906B7BF279CC66D1F5C9237119C8E87FAC6C942","orcidId":"0000-0002-5610-2124","documentHash":"bed54d21-0d5b-49fb-9334-2bc3350aa777"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62e4","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kamczyc","uuid":"5A8BECFFE82BACA911A3F24D5042E5115FCFC61E7AA622528898AE292607A2957269A2F17E26CF7EBE0A31FCB1ADD177A05D7C1F7F1E9D0A3A443E0DF6377DA9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3023-8709","documentHash":"c716a405-daa7-4e6d-a14e-91fcf9219f49"}],"objectId":"623c50db2467f04a32f04807","doi":"10.3390/ijms23063187","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23063187","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Seed Quantity or Quality?—Reproductive Responses of Females of Two Dioecious Woody Species to Long-Term Fertilisation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Although seed quality and quantity, as well as reproductive performance are important life history stages of plants, little is known about the reproductive responses of trees to environmental changes such as increased anthropogenic deposition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Dioecious plants are good models with which to test the environmental impact on female or male reproductive responses individually. We analysed effects of different long-term nutritional availability on the reproductive performance of two dioecious species (Taxus baccata L. and Juniperus communis L.) characterised by different life histories. By using pot experiments with vegetatively propagated plants grown in different fertilisation conditions, we observed an increase in plant growth and strobili production but a decrease in seed efficiency. Seeds produced by fertilised plants had greater seed mass. Fertiliser addition did not change C or N content nor the C/N ratio of T. baccata seeds, but increased N content and the N/P ratio; however, it did lower the C/N ratio in J. communis. Fertilisation did not change the metabolite profile in T. baccata but 18 metabolites were changed in J. communis. The study revealed new links between species life history, environmental changes, and reproduction. The findings imply that future environmental conditions may alter both seed productivity, and quality, as well as plant reproductive behaviour."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709499878c28a0473c027b","5e709494878c28a0473bfd1f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709346878c28a0473a62e4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"6","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709494878c28a0473bfd1f","5e709499878c28a0473c027b","5e709346878c28a0473a62e4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058203394"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b8645","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Bierza","uuid":"235DCC84874006791DFCAA42F79441EAC9E3C0F32C4ABA9EEE9668ADB5A199BE995290126743A011506A713DAEA2D634051F35F06F538C3D7DD0BD6768B59EE8","orcidId":"0000-0002-1789-5512","documentHash":"5cdb522d-9b33-4c03-8f71-ca83af6c84ba"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62e4","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kamczyc","uuid":"5A8BECFFE82BACA911A3F24D5042E5115FCFC61E7AA622528898AE292607A2957269A2F17E26CF7EBE0A31FCB1ADD177A05D7C1F7F1E9D0A3A443E0DF6377DA9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3023-8709","documentHash":"c716a405-daa7-4e6d-a14e-91fcf9219f49"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"03F14E2076FEABB44CC7B743F6FD9B59C0B3CE3F788CFE10E84226C037F019164ED6EE4E61A04DD072E5640611915200DC9689ED62B57A29F869C4D59C6D63FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-0985","documentHash":"002defbf-325a-404d-a301-7cc974eec233"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f444","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kompała-Bąba","uuid":"315003E5E564B83AD1EF114135A2B0B672D89A7B44D690DB85C7159F000090D22E2C2C6ECCE6ABF55B8EC6B235D92D39813C5599A5F90E5D140F1E4A4FE1443A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4736-4704","documentHash":"f7edb539-c684-4915-be07-b106f3a1d2e7"},{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f3c1","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Błońska","uuid":"B0EF0958EEC9AF856A5CE4341ADB16C176B093EAC804B9AA83EB9DB59722D99AF0791C0AE88AC8437144C06E7617DDA9863BA9D4075B91CC75578227713BEF71","orcidId":"0000-0002-1696-0001","documentHash":"b67a79f5-b648-495e-b8f1-10c7b10976b3"},{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f3a2","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Sierka","uuid":"6DE4451D6723100C6AFBEB6D88D0E3B809326CDAF3E0282C1A301CB21A263314ABBF43B22F44B538689CF3D13DF1740CAF5B06D7605E5960EE5EDA0295FB3AE0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3317-4552","documentHash":"0de6c8c0-b13e-4075-88fd-add5052886b4"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f022","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"2D9FBD547ED5A35CF5E1E8D2C5DD7679C3C0131E7732BE3AC783A27D55AC85FF0DA6826E6609ED403B95EF9697D29BDBD2B4621647DA0B5DEB0701E6C4E2184A","orcidId":"0000-0003-1936-2880","documentHash":"9db4886c-beb8-4af7-a752-7933a8390aa4"}],"objectId":"623c565e2467f04a32f067ac","doi":"10.1002/ldr.4224","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ldr.4224","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Functional ecosystem parameters: soil respiration and diversity of mite (Acari, Mesostigmata) communities after disturbance in the upper Cambrian rocks environment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We analyzed the changes in ecosystem functions (soil respiration and Mesostigmata mite abundance, species richness and diversity) on various habitats after flooding by highly mineralized and acidic drainage water with fine As-rich pyrite sediments, on a fragment of natural ecosystems. In total, 177 plots which represented six types of habitats (undisturbed: pine mixed forests, Salix spp. thickets, Juncus effusus communities, wet meadows, and disturbed: bare ground and dead Salix spp. thickets) were sampled twice, in June 2019 and September 2020. Our study revealed that flooding affected essential ecosystem parameters, such as soil Mesostigmata mite abundance, species richness and diversity, and soil respiration, via an extreme decrease of soil pH. In total, 968 mites were collected from pooled data from the two samplings. Mite abundance, species richness and diversity were mainly shaped by habitat type and soil pH, and partially by soil respiration. These parameters were lower in disturbed habitats (bare ground and dead Salix spp. thickets) as compared to undisturbed ones. The highest mean mite density was recorded from mixed forests (4750 ± 600 ind. m-2) and wet meadows (2678 ± 361 ind. m-2), whereas the lowest in bare ground (449 ± 113 ind. m-2) and dead Salix spp. thickets (537 ± 146 ind. m-2). We noticed that mite diversity may be helpful to predict future changes in the physicochemical parameters of soils in disturbed areas. The vegetation patches built up by species adapted to grow in habitats characterized by relatively high metal and metalloid content (J. effusus and Salix spp.) represent an intermediate state of function of ecosystems in the study area"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ec878c28a04739f444","5e7092e7878c28a04739f022","5e709439878c28a0473b8645","5e7092eb878c28a04739f3a2","5e7092eb878c28a04739f3c1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709346878c28a0473a62d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709346878c28a0473a62e4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"3343 - 3357","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e7878c28a04739f022","5e709346878c28a0473a62e4","5e709439878c28a0473b8645","5e7092eb878c28a04739f3c1","5e7092ec878c28a04739f444","5e7092eb878c28a04739f3a2","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c79","mniswId":"13433","title":"Land Degradation and Development","issn":"1085-3278","eissn":"1099-145X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4780d70e-689d-4936-9755-0109bd83c6cb"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["arsenic waters","biotic and abiotic soil parameters","fine As-rich pyrite geological deposits","flooding","plant communities","vegetation types"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058203433"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"03F14E2076FEABB44CC7B743F6FD9B59C0B3CE3F788CFE10E84226C037F019164ED6EE4E61A04DD072E5640611915200DC9689ED62B57A29F869C4D59C6D63FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-0985","documentHash":"002defbf-325a-404d-a301-7cc974eec233"},{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f3c1","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Błońska","uuid":"B0EF0958EEC9AF856A5CE4341ADB16C176B093EAC804B9AA83EB9DB59722D99AF0791C0AE88AC8437144C06E7617DDA9863BA9D4075B91CC75578227713BEF71","orcidId":"0000-0002-1696-0001","documentHash":"b67a79f5-b648-495e-b8f1-10c7b10976b3"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f022","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"2D9FBD547ED5A35CF5E1E8D2C5DD7679C3C0131E7732BE3AC783A27D55AC85FF0DA6826E6609ED403B95EF9697D29BDBD2B4621647DA0B5DEB0701E6C4E2184A","orcidId":"0000-0003-1936-2880","documentHash":"9db4886c-beb8-4af7-a752-7933a8390aa4"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Dyderski","uuid":"BA6020477E5CC315EB2E63B48E152FE36A33E8B3703BEC4812CECBFB0E0E652860C4E0E44BFA87F2AF6998A9580D130FEA7048AFDF4D7E950BC02A1F7F9A3632","orcidId":"0000-0003-4453-2781","documentHash":"6a027753-5078-4ffd-bbdc-95bb2c2a4c00"},{"objectId":"5e7091fd878c28a04738e383","name":"Damian","lastName":"Chmura","uuid":"40D57366F77EBE6B8A6B9FA079F5BDDFB81A0DE2A090DF464A85057A85B4AD63166B4C85D53A5378F9856A3F70169E98CDC9F5D548B5061F626FB952872E8B84","orcidId":"0000-0002-0242-8962","documentHash":"eb66a521-8719-43f9-9d7d-1cd07573c2bd"}],"objectId":"6267a98640970720eb51696f","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120205","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378112722001992","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"How different is the forest on post-coal mine heap regarded as novel ecosystem?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystems on the Earth. During natural succession, a quite known pattern of changes occur (i.e., the process of a gradual assemblage of plant species and associated organisms best adapted to the current habitat conditions). Much less is known about novel ecosystem establishment's primary spontaneous successional mechanisms due to human agency such as post-coal mine heaps habitats. The post-coal mine heaps are sites of pure mineral substrates and constrain (e.g., temperature, acidity, drought, salinity) habitat conditions. These conditions are variable both in time and space. Regardless of all these constraints, diverse vegetation is soon spontaneously developing on these sites. A characteristic feature of the vegetation successional development on post-coal mine heaps is the emergence of non-analogous species assemblages when comparing to the natural and seminatural vegetation communities and ecosystems.\n\nThis study aimed to compare the forest spontaneously developed on the mineral novel material habitat of the post-coal mining heap, with forests in the surrounding, on non-industrial habitats (located in Silesian Upland (South Poland)) in taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity at alpha (within-site) and beta (among sites) levels. The functional traits values of the recorded species composition were calculated to assess, e.g., the taxonomic alpha diversity Shannon's diversity and evenness index, Simpson index, functional richness (FRic), functional dispersion (FDis), functional divergence (FDA), and functional evenness (FEve). Rao's entropy has standardized the Biotic Novelty Index (BNI) to reflect the proportion of functional diversity contributed by novel species composition.\n\nThe results revealed higher functional richness and dispersion in coniferous forests than in forests on heaps. The plots from coniferous forests and heaps were distinctly differentiated in terms of species composition. No difference occurred in functional evenness and divergence. Vegetation patches of coniferous forests had 19% higher species richness and twice higher Faith's phylogenetic diversity, while no differences in species diversity described by Shannon's diversity index have been recorded. An almost thirty times higher biological novelty index in forests on heaps than in coniferous forests patches has been recorded. The RLQ - analysis of relationships between plant traits, species composition and environmental variables revealed significant associations between EIVs and type of habitat and plant traits. The plant traits such as SLA and SM seem indifferent and do not differentiate the two studied habitats.\n\nThe results showed that both understanding mechanisms by which these habitats are shaped and recognizing their biological potential and values are essential for nature conservation and management and challenge future studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii

L.)?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) is an important tree species and a critical component of European forests. Its share has gradually decreased due to the global climate crisis or fungal diseases. Therefore, it may influence dependent plant communities and soil organisms. Hence, we aimed to describe soil properties among different habitats where ash may grow and assess how these habitats affect abundance, species richness, and diversity of soil mite (Mesostigmata) communities. The study was conducted in eight stands (western Poland) grouped in four habitats differing in terms of soil conditions and stand species composition. Stands represented: (1) optimal habitats for ash growth with >90 % ash in the tree layer, (2) optimal habitats without ash in the tree layer, (3) suboptimal habitats with >60 % ash and co-dominance of Quercus robur L., and (4) transformed habitats with >60 % ash and co-dominance of Pinus sylvestris L. Soil environments within the research plots (circular plot area in each stand = 400 m2) were characterized by the description of the soil profile and 17 soil parameters provided for each of 72 soil samples. Mesostigmatid mites were extracted from 72 additionally collected samples into Berlese-Tullgren funnels, then mounted on slides and classified to species or genus levels.\n\nIn total, 362 mites were classified into 39 taxa. The most numerous taxa were Paragamasus sp. (13.0 % of all mites), Oodinychus ovalis (C. L. Koch) (11.3 %), and Paragamasus runcatellus (Berlese) (8.6 %). We found that decreasing nitrate‑nitrogen was accompanied by increasing mite abundance, species richness, and diversity. Furthermore, mesostigmatid mite abundance and species richness increased with increasing soil pH. Although soil moisture, pH of forest litter, magnesium, calcium, potassium, total nitrogen, and C/N mass ratio differed between all habitats, they did not affect Mesostigmatid abundance, species richness, and diversity. Nevertheless, analysis of variance conducted for the Canonical Correspondence Analysis model showed that habitat and pH of forest litter significantly impacted the community species composition of mesostigmatid mites. Our study provides a better understanding of the habitat requirements of soil mesostigmatid mites and, therefore, leads to improving the use of mesostigmatid mite taxa as effective bioindicators of soil and environmental quality."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709346878c28a0473a62d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ee","5e709346878c28a0473a62e4","621ee4b97523402df08b9716","602f6cf59543c7410626f48a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"180","pagesFromTo":"104633","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602f6cf59543c7410626f48a","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ee","621ee4b97523402df08b9716","5e709346878c28a0473a62e4","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477151","mniswId":"1520","title":"Applied Soil Ecology","issn":"0929-1393","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"0c7f44b5-1716-4f29-9d9d-5cd4da0e9d37"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6321d12e40970747dec297f6","year":"2022","volume":"180","documentHash":"eb39403e-c9f2-4a77-beda-e0c784e6ed51"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058239828"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5ae9","name":"Jan","lastName":"Suszka","uuid":"34F335FBF64B6699E47B646AFDE36D6CDE22A0A8E702A23656667883AD20618A0889FA1F5C40394B149EA7726C9A8617ABCD2F75BE612E219FC7C91237091BB3","orcidId":"0000-0001-6877-8458","documentHash":"6920ea5d-7646-4b5c-9ab4-9c0028560c8b"},{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Chmielarz","uuid":"856DB475E96758786F859939D96FF2F45BD85CB6AD60D9840A05952B12A24B26617EFE7FC6DABD99CCBD59C4C98E15B8DAD8FE07A70FAA4CC1AE06D6F7EE2945","documentHash":"4d7b8ab7-8ca8-431a-b26f-c3738e2eabe7"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8fc","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"AA2B99C3C5C95922E6B90B6A0077115CA183DD0020FCFE2EB69AC82808F79A087D0D6EC86BBE59046B257EAD936A69D4AD13E9C95245D3A25DF6B60E5508FF03","orcidId":"0000-0002-4297-5741","documentHash":"f7710694-9645-4c8d-a52f-053e3136073e"}],"objectId":"62b1b5b1409707603914a525","doi":"10.1186/s13595-022-01121-3","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13595-022-01121-3.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Desiccation does not increase frost resistance of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) seeds","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Key message: Decreasing acorns moisture content does not significantly increase the frost resistance of\npedunculate oak seeds. Slight reduction in acorn moisture content below the relatively high, optimal level\ndecreased seed survival at temperatures below − 5 °C. The limiting temperature for pedunculate oak’s acorns below\nwhich they lose their ability to germinate is about − 10 °C.\nContext: Seed moisture content plays an important role in successful seed storage of many species, as desiccation\nincreases frost resistance; however, oak seeds tolerate desiccation only to a very small extent.\nAims: In our study, we examined the impact of decreasing moisture content in acorns of pedunculate oak (Quercus\nrobur L.) on their frost resistance (below − 3 °C) and the growth of seedling derived from frozen seeds.\nMethods: Germination and seedling emergence of individual seeds, as well as the dry mass of their 3-month-old\nseedlings, were measured after acorn desiccation (24–40%, fresh weight basis) and desiccation followed by freezing\nat temperatures from − 3 °C to − 18 °C for 2 weeks.\nResults: Decreasing acorns moisture content did not significantly increase the frost resistance of pedunculate oak\nseeds. The lowest temperature at which at least half seeds remain viable was − 10 °C. Slight acorns desiccation had\nonly a small positive effect on seeds frozen below − 11 °C (down to − 13 °C), but in this case (acorn moisture\ncontent of 33%), low germinability after freezing made storage uneconomic because of the high mortality of seeds.\nGerminated seeds after desiccation and freezing showed no significant difference in later growth.\nConclusion: Fresh pedunculate oak seed can survive freezing temperature down to − 10 °C and produce good\nquality seedlings. Temperatures around − 11° to − 13 °C are near lethal to acorns and significantly reduce their\nviability. Overall, desiccation does not increase their frost resistance; therefore, in practice, it is important to keep\nacorns during a cold storage in the highly hydrated state"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f","5e709411878c28a0473b5ae9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"79","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f","5e709411878c28a0473b5ae9","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8fc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477072","mniswId":"1238","title":"Annals of Forest Science","issn":"1286-4560","eissn":"1297-966X","documentHash":"97db4f1f-2d59-41c4-ae44-2e95a6a88fda"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"624e928d2467f009a40d3da6","year":"2022","volume":"79","number":"1","documentHash":"0aba9b3c-4301-45a7-8246-41cf2dd1a6c7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Seeds storage,","Oak,","Desiccation,","Frost resistance,","Germination"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058282279"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"602fa1379543c7410626f6bd","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Malica","uuid":"7557AF8D838B53C93C6E4ED182AB67A55D9D16FBEB243717199705285E15E26C2A41B185DA3504E01AAB1CC2DC6F756BE4EC99750BB35E6309FCF36556B16155","orcidId":"0000-0001-6091-4881","documentHash":"fa97c181-bf67-4545-8587-3a77b428eb16"},{"objectId":"602f6cf59543c7410626f48a","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Urbanowski","uuid":"8D3493A1173A7C0E230D41D68007D41D10784A651ABB00C40298297DAC7E3C14AC5F65C7DADE39DE9E93E00A5C5FFC3B10A217C3439456D32EB77A4EFD9304A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-0060-3413","documentHash":"d02faccc-ee56-4c50-aa49-b27bccbf764b"},{"objectId":"5e709494878c28a0473bfd1f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Pers-Kamczyc","uuid":"D83281E557065B739F360EA976B0E2227CB54250BE0FFC7CD59C4845F03631C4BAB52892DD11A2827CB1337E7906B7BF279CC66D1F5C9237119C8E87FAC6C942","orcidId":"0000-0002-5610-2124","documentHash":"bed54d21-0d5b-49fb-9334-2bc3350aa777"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a643c","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Rączka","uuid":"8E4808F8B6A286673799EF6527DD82B1EAF157F4D7A6830A44A9C815625A10ECBC653BD79E22D76FBBB8AF840F1F117B44AE6F566D81D90B1DB42D8B223414CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-1636-8278","documentHash":"5e048cce-6537-4519-8004-67d904c0dbce"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6401","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Skorupski","uuid":"E0EE5C17D985DAAD9AA0325653BBD299F401ED3F7DD7AC467EF4E190ABA1364B1CC55B5E46F469A8A1BB3E4DB8749A906D9A0080B8501424732F7AB86D15386C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6752-3576","documentHash":"ed1b8cdf-a6ce-415d-ab8e-e2e5210f9b10"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62e4","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kamczyc","uuid":"5A8BECFFE82BACA911A3F24D5042E5115FCFC61E7AA622528898AE292607A2957269A2F17E26CF7EBE0A31FCB1ADD177A05D7C1F7F1E9D0A3A443E0DF6377DA9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3023-8709","documentHash":"c716a405-daa7-4e6d-a14e-91fcf9219f49"}],"objectId":"63579c334097072c1f9fd878","doi":"10.3390/f13101713","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/10/1713/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Soil Environment and Fauna Communities in Europe after Afforestation of Post-Agricultural Lands—A Review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Afforestation can make an important contribution mitigating the effects of changing climate and provide structural and functional benefits. Afforestation also provides challenges for forest managers connected with past land-use history; therefore, there is an urgent need to summarize knowledge about such habitats and point out the gaps in knowledge for planning future studies. Although post-agricultural forests cover a large forest area in Europe, our understanding of the mechanisms governing the below-ground environment is still poor, especially when soil fauna is considered. In this study, we revised knowledge about the soil environment and the response of soil fauna to afforestation on former agricultural lands located in Europe based on research articles from the ISI Web of Science database. Data came from various but distinct locations, compared forests with different types of agricultural lands, and presented previous knowledge about soil chemistry and accompanying soil fauna communities. Finally, we selected 15 studies, investigating soil fauna communities on post-agricultural lands. The meta-analysis was based on response ratio (R) for available data, although in many cases the data were incomplete. Results indicated that post-agricultural forests differ from arable lands in reference to soil pH, but not for soil organic matter and carbon content. Different soil animal groups were represented by a similar number of studies: microfauna (seven studies) and mesofauna (nine), whereas macrofauna were represented by five studies. Meta-analysis revealed that the response of soil fauna to afforestation differed between soil fauna size classes. Additionally, in total, 18 tree species, 12 soil types, and 20 soil parameters were provided in the literature but only a few of them were presented in a single study. Future studies should include the impact of microclimate, detailed stand characteristics and soil conditions, which could help to clearly describe the impact of certain tree species growing on certain soil types. In future soil fauna ecological studies, the data should include mean values, standard deviation (SD) and/or standard effort of means (SE) for abundance, species richness, diversity indices and number of collected samples. Providing the above mentioned information will give the broad audience the opportunity to include data in future comparative analyses"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602fa1379543c7410626f6bd","5e709347878c28a0473a6401","5e709347878c28a0473a643c","5e709346878c28a0473a62e4","602f6cf59543c7410626f48a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709494878c28a0473bfd1f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1713","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602fa1379543c7410626f6bd","602f6cf59543c7410626f48a","5e709347878c28a0473a643c","5e709347878c28a0473a6401","5e709494878c28a0473bfd1f","5e709346878c28a0473a62e4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d36","mniswId":"6744","title":"Forests","issn":"1999-4907","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"42a3ad4f-b110-4a47-9a0c-7c0eb98ed81c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63579c334097072c1f9fd879","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"10","documentHash":"66716fb5-ae58-4eda-9d74-234625e57bbf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058282469"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709494878c28a0473bfd1f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Pers-Kamczyc","uuid":"D83281E557065B739F360EA976B0E2227CB54250BE0FFC7CD59C4845F03631C4BAB52892DD11A2827CB1337E7906B7BF279CC66D1F5C9237119C8E87FAC6C942","orcidId":"0000-0002-5610-2124","documentHash":"bed54d21-0d5b-49fb-9334-2bc3350aa777"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62e4","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kamczyc","uuid":"5A8BECFFE82BACA911A3F24D5042E5115FCFC61E7AA622528898AE292607A2957269A2F17E26CF7EBE0A31FCB1ADD177A05D7C1F7F1E9D0A3A443E0DF6377DA9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3023-8709","documentHash":"c716a405-daa7-4e6d-a14e-91fcf9219f49"}],"objectId":"6377e2f740970746e8947407","doi":"10.3390/ijms232214105","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/22/14105/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Study of the Pollen Grain Metabolome under Deposition of Nitrogen and Phosphorus in Taxus baccata L. and Juniperus communis L.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nitrogen plays an important role in both quantitative and qualitative aspects of plant reproduction, including pollen grain compounds and seed production. Recent studies have pointed out that pollen grains produced by male plants of T. baccata and J. communis subjected to a long period of fertilizer supplementation have lower in vitro germination ability and higher nitrogen content. To gain molecular insights into these observations, we conducted GC–MS analysis of both species to characterize the metabolomes of dry, mature pollen grains, which allowed for the identification and quantification of more than 200 metabolites. The results demonstrated that fertilizer supplementation impacts the relative content of 14 metabolites in J. communis (9 downregulated and 5 upregulated) and 21 in T. baccata (6 downregulated and 15 upregulated). Although plants showed little similarity in patterns, in metabolite profiles, both up and down fold-changes were observed. This is the first report on the gymnosperm pollen grain metabolomic profile and changes induced by long-term nitrogen and phosphorus supplementation. Pollen grains produced by fertilizer-supplemented male individuals had significantly lower relative content of linolenic acid, 5,6-dihydrouracil, maltotriose, galactonic acid, D-xylulose, and glycerol-α-phosphate but higher content of sorbitol, glucosamine, and 1,5 anhydro-D-glucitol as well as n-acetyl-d-hexosamine, dimethyl phthalate, glycine, galactose-6- phosphate, D-fructose-6-phosphate, pyroglutamic acid, and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionic acid. Thus, in pollen grain samples earlier shown to have different germination abilities, the presence of different metabolites indicates a significant environmental impact on the quality of gymnosperm pollen grains."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709346878c28a0473a62e4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709494878c28a0473bfd1f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"14105","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709494878c28a0473bfd1f","5e709346878c28a0473a62e4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"637631ac40970765d46d45d8","year":"2022","volume":"23","number":"22","documentHash":"d88380ea-61c2-41cb-854e-709e00014bb8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058305057"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a6833","name":"Marta","lastName":"Bełka","uuid":"751DD00639CB19620175A876528A70E6A2E638E95F0D5C1AFEF5748FC0F778103FDAE794F0564F7538C784E4710C6B2293EE89B53C44774CEF0281527F9E3167","orcidId":"0000-0001-6851-7864","documentHash":"b1cf86e7-ca5d-4043-a98b-15879847d28a"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6395","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"9E6CCC7D54E74B342CD7F2BAFBEAA3121B093B429EFD2800A1F890D0BD0D16135A22B3AE0768D1FE55061739F7AF2EAE34BDB2BDB5DC26404EB746E605186E91","orcidId":"0000-0003-2877-8394","documentHash":"f4cd10c7-f151-4b22-8c0c-d776e3c21412"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f3","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Witkowski","uuid":"5BDD7D9CFF54354E6CFD24563D9077A38E49164E91A729D645973888027AED8F27043D941A77808270EF737ACC4BDD4DB8980E8313A2F59320EEF596DF9C6CF4","orcidId":"0000-0003-4630-765X","documentHash":"7365decf-00be-4578-a0af-9d688dad8873"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Dyderski","uuid":"BA6020477E5CC315EB2E63B48E152FE36A33E8B3703BEC4812CECBFB0E0E652860C4E0E44BFA87F2AF6998A9580D130FEA7048AFDF4D7E950BC02A1F7F9A3632","orcidId":"0000-0003-4453-2781","documentHash":"6a027753-5078-4ffd-bbdc-95bb2c2a4c00"}],"objectId":"62ceb69a4097070a2ca4eae9","doi":"10.3390/f13071097","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/7/1097/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Potential European Geographical Distribution of Gnathotrichus materiarius (Fitch, 1858) (Coleoptera: Scolytinae) under Current and Future Climate Conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Gnathotrichus materiarius (Fitch, 1858) is an alien ambrosia beetle from North America, that has been spreading across Europe since the 1930s. The species infests coniferous trees, excavating galleries in sapwood. However, to date very few studies have predicted changes in ambrosia beetle habitat suitability under changing climate conditions. To fill that gap in the current knowledge, we used the MaxEnt algorithm to estimate areas potentially suitable for this species in Europe, both under current climate conditions and those forecasted for the years 2050 and 2070. Our analyses showed areas where the species has not been reported, though the climatic conditions are suitable. Models for the forecasted conditions predicted an increase in suitable habitats. Due to the wide range of host trees, the species is likely to spread through the Balkans, the Black Sea and Caucasus region, Baltic countries, the Scandinavian Peninsula, and Ukraine. As a technical pest of coniferous sapwood, it can cause financial losses due to deterioration in quality of timber harvested in such regions. Our results will be helpful for the development of a climate-change-integrated management strategy to mitigate potential adverse effects"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f3","5e709347878c28a0473a6395","5e709349878c28a0473a6833"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1097","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f3","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e709349878c28a0473a6833","5e709347878c28a0473a6395"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d36","mniswId":"6744","title":"Forests","issn":"1999-4907","eissn":"1999-4907","documentHash":"05b7b2b7-d675-43a7-91dd-8446464e53a5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c824244097077330cd929c","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"7","documentHash":"3874096b-188d-44d2-808b-9300877a82b6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058308598"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f6ae3a5752340073806aa51","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Rabska","uuid":"DA2097832D1188BC23854BC1EC71FCC66356D39C61AA2A8A2C91ED7A3A266DEF772DC00C70FBF18AADF6761043824E3E75E3434C08D115EDBB51194B2D787020","orcidId":"0000-0003-2486-261X","documentHash":"b0926ba5-ab9a-4e87-a9b8-9c44a3c37c9a"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c0281","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"54CD81F6BBF3331E18570E71254EB9B958CD8194C6D2CEBF034F3C96739B7C93FD03138392F7886DF19EB6AB2F3C2A043386F1805AC09753C1623B3235712ECD","orcidId":"0000-0001-7037-8349","documentHash":"f3026ab6-adc5-40d3-99ef-d897310d9d87"},{"objectId":"5e709494878c28a0473bfd1f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Pers-Kamczyc","uuid":"D83281E557065B739F360EA976B0E2227CB54250BE0FFC7CD59C4845F03631C4BAB52892DD11A2827CB1337E7906B7BF279CC66D1F5C9237119C8E87FAC6C942","orcidId":"0000-0002-5610-2124","documentHash":"bed54d21-0d5b-49fb-9334-2bc3350aa777"},{"objectId":"5e70926d878c28a0473957ec","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Iszkuło","uuid":"A7F38FD928B1B6DD827FC253BE8C2EEE7607DE6B088AE2ACEA50547FD862CC320B88D05634CE31BD50CCAEE37483184DC0D639038CFA862872C3A43409C926BB","orcidId":"0000-0003-2067-729X","documentHash":"ae145509-2c0d-4e88-be74-78f52df5721f"},{"objectId":"5e70925f878c28a0473948eb","name":"Marian","lastName":"Giertych","uuid":"D85A74FC45279BF277CE35CC327DB0BA15FEC69CF45A8601C40DFADE662FAB22D5D07641DC212895E64D42741ACC82BA3784AE6B4B24105DC4C09A96085E1E04","orcidId":"0000-0001-5578-9545","documentHash":"8e1d0c77-5c7f-4cdd-857b-b0989664441f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-15","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":7,"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aafeb240970732a0a5b06c","doi":"10.3390/ijms232214225","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms232214225","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Consequences of the Reproductive Effort of Dioecious Taxus baccata L.

(Mistletoe) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation.Viscum album is a widespread obligate hemiparasite on a wide range of angiosperm and gymnosperm trees. Once thought to take just water and nutrients from its host via a haustorium, it is now suggested to also take carbon. Heavy infestations can reduce host vitality through prolific water use and carbon removal.Flowers are highly reduced but are primarily pollinated by flies, ants and bees. Seeds are dispersed by birds. Removal of the epicarp is necessary for successful seedling establishment, and seeds have a sticky viscin coat, adhering it to the host bark. Vegetative spread also happens under the bark of its host resulting in densities of >700 Mistletoe plants per host.Viscum album is a lowland species, most frequent in open human-made habitats extending into woodlands in Europe. It has been widely planted for folklore use centred around Christmas. Despite conservation concerns following removal of Mistletoe-laden old orchards, the species is thriving and needs control in some areas. Viscotoxins and lectins in leaves and shoots have been widely used in herbal medicine and now potentially in complementary cancer therapy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de24","uid":"bk8UqEe0F8JQF-eB0VLAY0w","uuid":"41ade527-eee8-4133-87f6-f9acbecc3acf","name":"Uniwersytet Zielonogórski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70925f878c28a0473948eb","5e70926d878c28a0473957ec"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de24","parentUuid":"41ade527-eee8-4133-87f6-f9acbecc3acf","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de24","rootUuid":"41ade527-eee8-4133-87f6-f9acbecc3acf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70925f878c28a0473948eb","5e70926d878c28a0473957ec","5e709261878c28a047394a3f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"Vol. 111","issue":"iss. 3","pagesFromTo":"701--739","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66b4ad80fdbe8318805c7607","66b4ad80fdbe8318805c7608","5e70925f878c28a0473948eb","5e70926d878c28a0473957ec","5e709261878c28a047394a3f","674843e4fdbe832682787912"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478631","mniswId":"10839","title":"Journal of Ecology","issn":"0022-0477","eissn":"1365-2745","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"7ddad4a5-1f24-4324-a20f-28d07a99ea12"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["germination","reproductive biology","altitudinal distribution","herbivory","climatic limitation","ecophysiology","geographical distribution","plant hemiparasite"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058386458"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709474878c28a0473bd695","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Staszak","uuid":"07E706761E991BE12E98193E438F5F550E529FE11BD70DFB5A2C5DEBFD79809203F3678A9FB7BA5C2C2C24AB5EE898ECA458F479573EFB5CF060B8ABE206C885","orcidId":"0000-0002-7913-3716","documentHash":"f5ba2307-81ab-4386-862b-bec07759d73a"},{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b7759","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kijowska-Oberc","uuid":"AFA5CA4E3E220E48F2421A1E1115D8B19FC9172D41060064D14FA67148D1FB28EB068A935FD82213BCB4126483B44E5388DEE49FEFEAE66B73EEC859287382A1","documentHash":"480a960f-6d29-408a-8200-dbbdeaf3668c"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8fc","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"AA2B99C3C5C95922E6B90B6A0077115CA183DD0020FCFE2EB69AC82808F79A087D0D6EC86BBE59046B257EAD936A69D4AD13E9C95245D3A25DF6B60E5508FF03","orcidId":"0000-0002-4297-5741","documentHash":"f7710694-9645-4c8d-a52f-053e3136073e"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394a38","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Ratajczak","uuid":"697FF082D291F06AA3859F78E0EC87A3B084B3435985CD665D0ED090BCD75E40FB3CD6909C0D749206AD4743DAAF98856265C3A7E7F7E3E5EE358B50EF089EC6","orcidId":"0000-0003-2710-4638","documentHash":"cac17ac6-c01f-41d6-9615-1bd230a14eb8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63ac398b40970769fc7bb359","doi":"10.12657/denbio.087.011","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.12657/denbio.087.011","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Exogenous seed treatment with proline and its consequences to Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)

The effect of exogenous proline has been studied in three stages\nof initial plant development.\nThe collected seeds were soaked in water or 8 mM proline solution and placed on the germinators. The\ngermination capacity and the mean germination time were determined. Seedlings with radicles >10 mm\nwere transferred to the sand-peat substrate at a constant temperature of 20 °C. Seedlings at 3 subsequent\ndevelopmental stages (S1 – germinated seeds with radicles > 3 mm; S2 – seedlings with radicles >10 mm;\nS3 – established seedlings grown for 90 days) were examined for the oxygen consumption rate, total anti-\noxidant capacity, hydrogen peroxide level, malondialdehyde level and intracellular proline content.\nProline treatment was conducive to lowering the levels of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde at stage\nS1. At the subsequent stages of development, the levels of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde in-\ncreased, and at the S3 stage, there was also a marked increase in total antioxidant capacity. At stage S3, the\nseedlings of the proline treatment were characterized by a lower total mass, and the response to exogenous\nproline was stronger in the root tissues than in the leaves. The oxygen consumption rate was higher for the\nproline treatment at all stages of development.\nSeedlings at the analyzed stages of establishment differed in response to proline treatment. Exogenous\nproline had some beneficial effects during the first phase of germination by reducing the level of hydrogen\nperoxide and improving the condition of lipid membranes. In the subsequent stages of seedling develop-\nment, in response to the same concentration of proline solution, undesirable effects, such as an increase in\nhydrogen peroxide levels and damage to cytoplasmic membranes, were observed. Optimal concentrations\nof exogenous proline should be determined prior to commercial use of proline treatment to improve plant\nstress tolerance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii

Contribution to Global Research on Somatic Embryogenesis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is a complex process that begins with regaining totipotency in some somatic cells, proceeds through embryo development and maturation, and ends with the formation of a whole plant. Since the first publications on SE in 1958, this regeneration process has been applied to the in vitro propagation of many plant species and has led to the development of some specific model systems. SE has been used to expand our understanding of the cytomorphological, physiological, biochemical, and genetic processes that govern the earliest developmental events in the life of plants. This paper summarizes the achievements of Polish research groups working on SE systems established for several plants (gentians, the tree fern Cyathea delgadii Sternb., and conifers) and three model species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago sativa, and M. truncatula). SE systems have used a broad spectrum of experimental approaches involving genomic tools (transcriptomics, proteomics, and chromatin analyses), physiological methods which focus on phytohormones, and cytological techniques. Studies on the experimental models of A. thaliana and Medicago spp. have resulted in the identification of new genetic and epigenetic elements of the complex regulatory network controlling embryogenic induction in plant somatic cells. The protocol developed for ferns has provided a unique and simple system for cytological analysis of early SE events that occur in a single cell of initial explants. Gentian embryogenic suspension cultures have successfully been used in broad biotechnological applications, including plant transformation, protoplast isolation, culture, and fusion. Systems described for coniferous species effectively produced many vigorous somatic seedlings and cost-efficient storage of genotypes during clonal field-testing. The research undertaken by Polish scientists has resulted in developing experimental systems that have enabled significant advances in SE knowledge."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b5903"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709301878c28a0473a0e2a","5e7092e7878c28a04739effb"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"91","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ad3ed540970728ba305583","5e7092e7878c28a04739effb","63ad3ed540970728ba305585","5e70940f878c28a0473b5903","63ad3ed540970728ba305586","63ad3ed540970728ba305587","63ad3ed540970728ba305588","63ad3ed540970728ba305589","5e709301878c28a0473a0e2a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e59","mniswId":"328","title":"Acta Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae","issn":"0001-6977","eissn":"2083-9480","websiteLink":"https://pbsociety.org.pl/journals/index.php/asbp","documentHash":"cb161044-0897-472a-9586-3bc2a5bffdea"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63299d774097077b0b45296d","year":"2022","volume":"91","documentHash":"70d6e244-2342-41d8-9e89-37c4b19f31c9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"lat","keywords":["Arabidopsis thaliana","Cyathea delgadii","Gentiana spp.","Medicago spp."]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["conifers","experimental model systems"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058388561"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"648d1aa940e3ff055afbad3c","name":"Joao Paulo","lastName":"Rodrigues Martins","uuid":"2968C57B9DEB71FCFD39AD3B6BB061A51E46188FEF23BDF1C0528AEC174302FFF2464F76E23995A4DC98B5C64444ADE44E83E97025064F549073629D483DE31F","documentHash":"d5ef666c-de67-4c69-9e2f-205aca2d5ade"},{"objectId":"63ac2b1d40970769fc7a1b23","name":"Marcel Merlo","lastName":"Mendes","documentHash":"66748d04-a40a-4a74-b4c7-202b66c80755"},{"objectId":"61ce79387523401fc10e7c26","name":"Juan","lastName":"Ley Lopez","uuid":"062947DB65FF04724BE20C9D139E1A1EE690AA36F5D5BC8A1BF0AAE3542D41A4409929755F9B5DBB87BA0B3DE588186533B52D5380C6B60797DFC9063E61E2CA","documentHash":"3a3e7e21-23f5-485a-a512-508d00a6a5f3"},{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af520","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kalemba","uuid":"950BDF2DA3FCB4FC8AB0FEF1021CEBE30A717BD1EA3C5A619966773ABF55FD9A1D13BBC971390D54EC7B15067DA295F3AC436861838B88A192F084ED913608CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-0092-0339","documentHash":"10e98ccc-ffee-4aa9-8925-724dc30f36bc"},{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Chmielarz","uuid":"856DB475E96758786F859939D96FF2F45BD85CB6AD60D9840A05952B12A24B26617EFE7FC6DABD99CCBD59C4C98E15B8DAD8FE07A70FAA4CC1AE06D6F7EE2945","documentHash":"4d7b8ab7-8ca8-431a-b26f-c3738e2eabe7"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8fc","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"AA2B99C3C5C95922E6B90B6A0077115CA183DD0020FCFE2EB69AC82808F79A087D0D6EC86BBE59046B257EAD936A69D4AD13E9C95245D3A25DF6B60E5508FF03","orcidId":"0000-0002-4297-5741","documentHash":"f7710694-9645-4c8d-a52f-053e3136073e"}],"objectId":"63ac2b1d40970769fc7a1b21","doi":"10.1007/s11240-022-02339-9","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11240-022-02339-9.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"6-Benzylaminopurine and kinetin modulations during in vitro propagation of Quercus robur (L.): an assessment of anatomical, biochemical, and physiological profiling of shoots","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"For many woody species, such as Quercus robur, cytokinins in the culture medium are required to maintain in vitro plant material. Among synthetic cytokinins, 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and kinetin (KIN) are the most frequently used. In addition to inducing shoots, cytokinins can cause morphophysiological disorders. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the anatomical, biochemical, and physiological alterations and profiles of Q. robur shoots exposed to two cytokinins, applied alone and in combination. Shoots previously established in vitro were transferred to WPM culture media supplemented with BAP at concentrations of 0, 1.25, and 3.50 µM combined with KIN at concentrations of 0, 0.62, and 1.25 µM\ntotaling 9 treatments. Anatomical, physiological, and biochemical analyses were performed after 40 d of culture. BAP induced the formation of new buds with anatomically underdeveloped leaves; induced shoot-tip necrosis, which is considered a response to the inefficient transport of water and nutrients; reduced the thickness of the cell walls of phloem fibers; and decreased the content of phenolic compounds and photosynthetic pigments. These responses were less pronounced with co-exposure to KIN. In contrast, KIN alone stimulated a larger area of secondary xylem and more lignified cell walls.

These adjustments include the production of thick, sun-type leaves\ncontaining thicker mesophyll and longer palisade cells than in shade-type leaves. We asked whether in the shade-regenerating tree Acer pseudoplatanus, the increase in leaf thickness and expansion of leaf tissues are possible also in leaves that are already fully formed, a response reported so far only for a handful of species. We acclimated potted seedlings to eight levels (from 1 to 100%) of solar irradiance and, in late summer, transferred a subset of them to full sunlight. Within 30 days, the preshaded leaves increased leaf mass per area and became thicker mostly due to the elongation of palisade cells, except for the most shaded individuals which sufered irreversible photo-oxidative damage. This anatomical acclimation was accompanied by a transient decline in photosynthetic efciency of PSII (Fv/FM), the magnitude of which was related to the degree of preshading. The Fv/FM recovered substantially within the re-acclimation period. However, leaves of transferred plants were shed earlier in the fall, indicating that the acclimation was not fully efective. These results show that A. pseudoplatanus is one of the few known species in which mature leaves may re-acclimate anatomically to increased irradiance. This may be an important mechanism enhancing utilization of gaps created during the growing season."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii

One of the most important aspects to be considered to achieve this fundamental goal is the implementation of Sustainable Forest Operations (SFOs). This study aims to investigate how and to what extent forest logging and silvicultural treatments affect soil physicochemical properties in the context of Mediterranean forestry by summarizing the results of 55 field studies, performed within the development of Master’s and PhD theses, carried out in Italy over the last 15 years. In order to define reliable and scalable conclusions, and going beyond the typical case-study approach, we applied a data synthesis under the meta-analytic framework summarizing the results of the studies analyzed. The results show that disturbance triggered by the silvicultural treatments (meant as an alteration of canopy cover as a consequence of the removal of some trees) is much lower than that caused by forest logging, in particular passage of forest vehicles and woody loads. Furthermore, as expected, a clear relationship was observed between the impacts on soil physicochemical properties and biological impacts. Based on our results we recommend that ground-based extraction on slopes steeper than 20 per cent should be limited, extending the applications of skyline systems or winch-assisted extraction. Interestingly, different conditions of terrain roughness showed variable effects on the magnitude of impacts, suggesting the need for future dedicated studies on this topic. The application of machineries specifically developed for the forestry sector showed better performance than lower levels of mechanizations, confirming what was reported in previous literature on the topic. However, the major finding from this study clearly shows that the way in which extraction is carried out is the major factor causing soil disturbance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"96","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"547-560","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c796a8752340480571c999","63db961b40970725841eb6a9","63db961b40970725841eb6aa","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d34","mniswId":"6742","title":"Forestry","issn":"0015-752X","eissn":"1464-3626","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b86c5856-ad70-443e-bfd0-763f1e5833d8"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sustainable Forest Management","Sustainable Forest Operations","Reduced-Impact Logging","Retention Forestry","Clear-cut"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058501913"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63a30924409707633a255876","name":"Quadri A.","lastName":"Anibaba","documentHash":"875eb44a-dfa5-4754-a1e4-ba00cf6a10dd"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"03F14E2076FEABB44CC7B743F6FD9B59C0B3CE3F788CFE10E84226C037F019164ED6EE4E61A04DD072E5640611915200DC9689ED62B57A29F869C4D59C6D63FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-0985","documentHash":"002defbf-325a-404d-a301-7cc974eec233"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Dyderski","uuid":"BA6020477E5CC315EB2E63B48E152FE36A33E8B3703BEC4812CECBFB0E0E652860C4E0E44BFA87F2AF6998A9580D130FEA7048AFDF4D7E950BC02A1F7F9A3632","orcidId":"0000-0003-4453-2781","documentHash":"6a027753-5078-4ffd-bbdc-95bb2c2a4c00"}],"objectId":"63a30924409707633a255874","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154053","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969722011457?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Predicted range shifts of invasive giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum) in Europe","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Heracleum mantegazzianum Sommier & Levier (Giant hogweed) has spread across Europe after its introduction as an ornamental from the native range in the Western Greater Caucasus. In addition to its invasive capability, H. mantegazzianum reduces the alpha diversity of native species in the non-native range and can cause seconddegree burns when its phytotoxic sap contacts the skin upon exposure to sunlight. Previous studies on H. mantegazzianum distribution focused on individual countries, therefore we know little about the potential shift of the species distribution under changing climate at the continental scale. To fill that gap in the current knowledge, we aimed to (i) identify the most important climatic factors for the distribution of H. mantegazzianum in Europe, (ii) recognize areas that will be suitable and unsuitable for future climate scenarios to prioritize management action.\nOur study showed that the mean temperature of the coldest quarter (bio11) and temperature annual range (bio7) were themost important bioclimatic variables predicting the suitable habitat of the species in Europe. For all scenarios, we found that the majority of the range changes expected by 2100 will occur as early as 2041. We predicted an overall decrease in climatically suitable area for H. mantegazzianum under climate change with over three quarters (i.e. 94%) of the suitable area reduced under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 585 in 2100. However, under the same scenario, climate conditions will likely favour the expansion (i.e. 20%) of H. mantegazzianum in northern Europe. The results from the present study will help in developing a climate change-integrated management strategy, most especially in northern Europe where range expansion is predicted."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","63a30924409707633a255876"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"825","pagesFromTo":"154053","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63a30924409707633a255876","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","issn":"0048-9697","documentHash":"536a2e2c-aae7-4edb-84d0-5d817a2d0285"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a30924409707633a255875","year":"2022","volume":"825","documentHash":"a2b5ee1b-8faa-4773-b22c-f301e0496cdb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biological invasions","Range shifts","Species distribution models","MaxEnt","Bioclimatic modeling","Europe"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058516497"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70939f878c28a0473adf7d","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Kurpisz","uuid":"14CE675D99DBEEF7AA99EF4EEFFE9EEFBF7BCEA5207B76F0CE3477716FD71E62DBEFEFE5A47AEC42B302626847082A9CBDC9CC3DE1B7986D3408D8CB0D2DCF5A","orcidId":"0000-0002-1624-0514","documentHash":"88ef0fda-dff8-434f-847d-90cc0b8eddcd"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394a2b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"F8CABA3C5E7FBDDE3ED13C1C6ED2D085E41D6278217C4BA0FF3482702D51D266AC8FBFEA1C5DFCF7A83F8BC0D9B2534A82B3D98091F2B6FA98DB15B3A3A9CD4C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0334-5093","documentHash":"4dccf9ed-82bf-4a16-8d86-17a43566b74e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aafe3840970732a0a5acb4","doi":"10.3390/ijms232113412","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/21/13412/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Epigenetic Mechanisms of Tree Responses to Climatic Changes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Forest trees are complex perennial organisms that are adapted to the local environment in the results of prevailing climate conditions in population history. Because they lead a sedentary lifestyle, plants are exposed to various environmental stimuli, such as changes which can lead to the rapid adjustment or failure of their defence mechanisms. As forests play a key role in environment homeostasis and are the source of many products, it is crucial to estimate the role of forest trees’ plasticity mechanisms in the face of the climate change. Fast epigenetic adjustment is the basis for surviving climate fluctuations, however the question is whether this mechanism will be also efficient if climate fluctuations increase. Epigenetic modifications enable rapid reactions to the inducing stimulus by establishing chromatin patterns and manipulating gene expression without affecting the DNA itself. This work aimed to gather information about the epigenetic mechanisms of tree responses to changing environmental conditions, in order to summarise what is known so far and emphasize the significance of the discussed issue. Applying this knowledge in the future to study the interactions between climate change and gene regulation at the levels of plant development could generate answers to questions about the limitations of plasticity of plant adaptation to changing environment. We still know very little about how organisms, especially trees, cope with climate change and we believe that this overview will encourage researchers to fill this gap in the knowledge, and that results will be applied in improving defensive capacity of this ecologically and economically important species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709261878c28a047394a2b","5e70939f878c28a0473adf7d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"21","pagesFromTo":"13412","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70939f878c28a0473adf7d","5e709261878c28a047394a2b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6357a0ca4097072c1fa0200e","year":"2022","volume":"23","number":"21","documentHash":"d840f2f6-a745-49a2-9202-f6dc6d02dbe3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["acclimatization;","adaptation;","chromatin modifications;","climate change;","DNA methylation;","forest;","histone modification;","non-coding RNA;","plasticity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058522673"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af520","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kalemba","uuid":"950BDF2DA3FCB4FC8AB0FEF1021CEBE30A717BD1EA3C5A619966773ABF55FD9A1D13BBC971390D54EC7B15067DA295F3AC436861838B88A192F084ED913608CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-0092-0339","documentHash":"10e98ccc-ffee-4aa9-8925-724dc30f36bc"},{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Chmielarz","uuid":"856DB475E96758786F859939D96FF2F45BD85CB6AD60D9840A05952B12A24B26617EFE7FC6DABD99CCBD59C4C98E15B8DAD8FE07A70FAA4CC1AE06D6F7EE2945","documentHash":"4d7b8ab7-8ca8-431a-b26f-c3738e2eabe7"},{"objectId":"5e7092ef878c28a04739f7a8","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wyka","uuid":"F1163110C4C1FA008A8B3F5B027151823CE1D2D77B56408C5FC79A44EDE703D0F7458D37C2F395EF0571BD76DA43FA228A49DCAAAEDD6F1495FD82589E70161E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0569-8009","documentHash":"1ea71ff9-b0d1-43ff-9e6e-a371c123f48e"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8fc","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"AA2B99C3C5C95922E6B90B6A0077115CA183DD0020FCFE2EB69AC82808F79A087D0D6EC86BBE59046B257EAD936A69D4AD13E9C95245D3A25DF6B60E5508FF03","orcidId":"0000-0002-4297-5741","documentHash":"f7710694-9645-4c8d-a52f-053e3136073e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"6405db3b409707703558e187","doi":"10.3390/f13122142","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Changes in Reserve Materials Deposited in Cotyledons of Pedunculate Oak (Quercus robur L.)

We investigated the effectiveness of using a slightly lowered storage temperature (−5 °C) in combination with slight dehydration of acorns (38% MC) for improving seed viability during 18 months of storage. To this end, we performed a factorial experiment using storage temperatures of −5 °C and −3 °C combined with 38% and 40% seed MC and subsampled the acorns at 4-month intervals over 18 months. The modified regime of −5 °C combined with 38% MC resulted in increased germination and emergence rates but only when seeds were stored for 12 months. It also restricted seed biomass loss. Starch depletion was recorded on consecutive sampling dates, showing little dependence on storage conditions. At −5 °C at both MC, it was accompanied by an accumulation of soluble carbohydrates. Fat reserves also decreased under all storage conditions, but the slowest decrease was at −5 °C and 38% MC. We conclude that storing acorns in a slightly dehydrated state (38% MC) at −5 °C produced a transient improvement in seed viability and that the observed increase in soluble carbohydrates may indicate initiation of prosurvival mechanisms, such as osmo- and cryoprotection.</jats:p>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8fc","5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f","5e7093b1878c28a0473af520"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-13","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8fc","5e7093b1878c28a0473af520","5e7092ef878c28a04739f7a8","5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d36","mniswId":"6744","title":"Forests","issn":"1999-4907","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"42a3ad4f-b110-4a47-9a0c-7c0eb98ed81c"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058522928"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aafc7140970732a0a58ac1","name":"Marek","lastName":"Kasprowicz","documentHash":"a58c78c6-c11b-4a7d-8666-c13accb0a11e"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c0292","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Rawlik","uuid":"5B067CAC8B2137636BF0E8B3947C5C57027EA81145E05205FE8D29AEFD057470A4D64B60C50D62B7C14008EE23EE7DFA4111592AD0B2F9C87A90A2465CB4853B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7299-8437","documentHash":"ef5c421d-e45d-464d-b954-b2f3c7c9734a"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a63a8","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Nowiński","uuid":"DFEF24CAABF6B857C6BC7E263F813C31B100276ED6D678386C11DB8B7D035924BED75DC2A98969271B167CAA8718D364FCEB3D30CF9E3184B38AB8BA6C79F428","orcidId":"0000-0001-9725-2463","documentHash":"40de9f47-282c-4423-a181-0bc6cfe48242"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"03F14E2076FEABB44CC7B743F6FD9B59C0B3CE3F788CFE10E84226C037F019164ED6EE4E61A04DD072E5640611915200DC9689ED62B57A29F869C4D59C6D63FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-0985","documentHash":"002defbf-325a-404d-a301-7cc974eec233"}],"objectId":"63aafc7140970732a0a58ac0","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120008","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0378112722000020?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The afterlife of herbaceous plant species: A litter decomposition experiment in a temperate oak-hornbeam forest","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Understanding the mechanisms of singular species and their traits impacts on ecosystem functions, is crucial in the era of unprecedented anthropogenic changes of the environment, e.g. to predict changes in carbon and nutrient cycling connected with species shifts. It may allow us to take protective measurements and mitigate the negative effects of global changes. Litter decomposition is a crucial process shaping nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Studies on decomposition in forest ecosystems are mainly limited to foliar litter. In contrast to woody plant species, our knowledge of decomposition of herbaceous plants is scarce. Thus, unanswered questions remain about the model that best describes the decomposition process of herbaceous plants. The relationship of decomposition rate to functional traits is unknown for this species pool. We used the litter bag method to determine the decomposition rate of 13 herbaceous plant species and four overstory tree species growing in a temperate oak-hornbeam forest. We showed that the litter decomposition rate and C and N release were higher in spring ephemerals than summer green herbaceous species, as the plants with small total individual aboveground biomass (TAB) and small total leaf area (TLA) decomposed the fastest. Our results demonstrate that in this generally acquisitive group of plants, size traits have a stronger impact on decomposition than economic traits. For almost all species, the two-phase exponential decay model explains the course of herbaceous species litter decomposition only slightly better than the single exponential model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii

(Gordon) Carrière, is described as a new nothospecies from the Kórnik Arboretum, Poland, based on plants obtained in 1988 from the Botanical Garden in Gothenburg, Sweden. The hybrid was found for the first time at the Hørsholm Arboretum, Denmark, in 1938, among seedlings grown from seeds collected from Thuja standishii. Plants grown from rooted scions of this hybrid were planted in several places within the Hørsholm Arboretum. Soon, the hybrid plants were gifted to the Botanical Gardens in Copenhagen and Gothenburg as well to the Poulsen’s Plant Nursery in Kvistgård. In 1967 seedlings were sent from Kvistgård to the National Arboretum in Washington, where one of them developed into a particularly showy, lush and vigorous plant characterized by a dense, narrow, conical crown. The offspring obtained from rooted scions turned out to be very drought and wind-resistant, especially suitable for the formation of tall hedges and windbreak screens. This plant, now very widespread in cultivation, especially in the United States, goes by the name of Thuja ‘Green Giant’. In terms of morphology, many features of Th. ×soeegaardii are intermediate as compared to the parent species. From the Th. plicata, it differs by the following characteristics: leaves not or only weakly shining above, lateral leaves with inwardly curved (not straight) apices, the apical part of lower central leaves thickened and slightly bent from the stem (not appressed), glands on central leaves only weakly visible, central leaves of primary shoots acuminate (not long acuminate) and seed wings sparsely papillose in the upper part (only rarely smooth). From Th. standishii, it can be distinguished by the less glaucous upper leaf surface, the less protruding apical part of lower central leaves, at least faintly visible glands on central leaves, acuminate (not acute) central leaves of primary shoots and less distinctly papillose upper part of seed wings."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii

attention due to reported climatic changes. We investigated density, diversity, and community structure of soil mites (Mesostigmata) in tree biogroups of Betula pendula, Picea abies, and Pinus sylvestris with microhabitats represented by Calluna vulgaris, Dicranum scoparium, Vaccinium myrtillus and Vaccinium vitis‐idaea plant patches and accumulated litter in humid and cold rock crevices a few meters deep. We analyzed the effects of climatic (light availability, precipitation, temperature) and environmental (litter pH, organic matter thickness, microhabitat type) conditions on mite communities based on 1080 samples collected during two vegetation periods (2004‐2005). Results revealed that litter pH was shaped by microhabitat type (plant patches and rock crevices) whereas organic matter thickness depended on tree species and microhabitat type. Also, light availability differed between tree biogroups and microhabitats. This study documented that Mesostigmata abundance was shaped by maximum daily temperature whilst species richness was also affected by total monthly precipitation, tree species (P. sylvestris) and microhabitat (rock crevices). Results revealed that mite density ranged from 3001 ± 213 ind. × m‐2 in the Picea abies biogroup to 3310 ± 350 ind. × m‐2 in Pinus sylvestris. On the microhabitat level, mite density ranged from 2571 ± 170 ind. × m‐2 in Vaccinium myrtillus patches to 4137 ± 463 ind. × m‐2 in rock crevices. Total number of recorded species was highest in rock crevices (41 species), and lowest in C. vulgaris (19). In conclusion, results indicated that climatic conditions modulate mite communities on an isolated rocky island. This study documented that maximum daily temperature during the vegetation period affected Mesostigmata abundance, whereas species richness and diversity were also shaped by total monthly precipitation and tree species (P. sylvestris). Additionally, the community was also affected by litter acidity, organic matter and tree species. This article is protected by copyright.

This is due to the scarce presence of aerial extraction systems such as cable yarders. Considering the importance of forest soil for all ecosystem services, the evaluation of the disturbance that a given extraction system has on the forest soil is a fundamental aspect in the framework of sustainable forest management. Therefore, this study was developed to assess the disturbance caused to the physicochemical and biological features of soil and to coppice after mule logging according to the standards of silvicultural treatment, as well as the recovery time needed after the logging intervention. Four cutting blocks located in Central Italy represented the study area, one cutting block represented the unharvested control, while the others were logged 3 years (CB-2019), 8 years (CB-2014) and 10 years (CB-2012) prior to the field surveys. In each harvested cutting block the soil was subdivided into disturbed soil (DIST-mule trails) and low disturbance soil (LD-area within the harvested cutting block not affected by mule passage). This experimental design assessed the disturbance caused by logging operations by mules (DIST soil) and the silvicultural treatment (LD soil) to soil physicochemical (bulk density, penetration resistance, shear resistance, and soil organic matter) and biological properties (soil microarthropod community evaluated with the QBS-ar index). The results revealed a significant disturbance in the mule trails for all the investigated variables. The disturbance was particularly strong for the QBS-ar index, with values which were lower than half of those of the control area. Furthermore, no recovery process was evident even after 10 years from the logging interventions. Instead, values of the various parameters became worse with time after harvesting. On the other hand, no marked disturbance was revealed in LD soil, except for a significant decrease in soil organic matter. Although this is a preliminary evaluation that needs to be confirmed with further study, this trial suggested that mule logging cannot be considered a fully low-impact approach to forest operations and that studies with a longer time span after harvesting are needed to assess the recovery process in the mule trails."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"655","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c796a8752340480571c999","64213a4d40970734a54bc0aa","64213a4d40970734a54bc0ab","64213a4d40970734a54bc0ac"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d36","mniswId":"6744","title":"Forests","issn":"1999-4907","eissn":"1999-4907","documentHash":"05b7b2b7-d675-43a7-91dd-8446464e53a5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64213a4d40970734a54bc0a8","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"3","documentHash":"78c3796d-f58c-44bc-8a22-562bd957c07a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mule trails","sustainable forest operations","QBS-ar index","holm oak","forwarding"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058550190"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"642fe6b44097074b64683a6d","name":"Lech","lastName":"Urbaniak","documentHash":"a2b70c42-fb8a-445e-b9d1-3d867d90c7e0"},{"objectId":"642fe6b44097074b64683a6c","name":"Roman","lastName":"Rożkowski","documentHash":"25b6589f-3636-4957-9da3-8db4228c02f8"},{"objectId":"642fe6b44097074b64683a6b","name":"Monika","lastName":"Litkowiec","documentHash":"097b0163-7e10-4abc-8725-009776804462"},{"objectId":"5e70939f878c28a0473adf84","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Wójkiewicz","uuid":"A2AAB1F519315C8DD88B93156AED89B6CBABAAEB47C7CD1175201CC2EE7020ADC81DA50D435A13FB6B48F112EF72C58F948F33893F1B88BA15A1B4A3467B2C14","orcidId":"0000-0003-0111-6489","documentHash":"0cf504aa-b12f-484b-b862-c4a27d03d185"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473aca3a","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Żukowska","uuid":"B00CEC36E1DD7394374A7FD8AA13E7C6CA220A48C6005537AE5DDBBD2D4466B7FE0589C8566129A3B8A55671D3A46B44070DB2FBC03EEC8B914A123A8E21A803","orcidId":"0000-0002-5273-4431","documentHash":"c487e759-992b-4ec6-aa32-47b2a9193a85"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d3df","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"8A602517ADF52D5F77A72F002F72D7E337DA2627D8DF787AA6EFD4BAE7629D91BF133CB7ECC9AACBEECBADBE5400FFCD8E14B7D38EE7BAFE18A7A107B15A2D04","orcidId":"0000-0003-2037-1004","documentHash":"07f86f1c-729e-4122-abd5-a583efdbda85"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393e71","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Lewandowski","uuid":"37172BE2A1A0DEB91A6DDA44E1AA99AB6E12F59D904D230E4D3AB49F68473C93ED3E677CFADBDCF4095D28FA7F81A9B3C9C17538047BC1D10C28440F5A2A2F2E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9503-1541","documentHash":"acf267b9-199f-456e-8802-fe7a1d4f1eaf"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"642fe6b44097074b64683a66","doi":"10.12657/denbio.089.005","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.12657/denbio.089.005","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Changes in the gene pool composition of Scots pine depending on the mode of regeneration","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Silvicultural practices can alter forest genetic resources in unpredictable ways, thereby influencing the adaptive and evolutionary potential of forest populations. This is especially alarming in the case of species with more northern distribution centers, due to the lack of area that can be colonized further north. In this article, we studied the genetic diversity of the Scots pine seed tree stand in Poland, its natural regeneration, and two artificially established progeny plantations. The research aimed to determine whether the regeneration mode had affected the efficiency of the gene pool transmission from the maternal seed stand to its offspring. Using nuclear microsatellite markers we compared the parameters of genetic variation and allelic composition among the studied stands. The results showed that all stands represent a common genetic pool with slightly higher values of observed heterozygosity in the case of progeny plantations. Inbreeding was significant only in natural regeneration. All stands have gained and lost rare alleles compared\nto the maternal seed stand. Nevertheless, the analysis of population differentiation showed that the gene pool of the maternal stand had been transmitted more efficiently to the natural regeneration, though the difference was only minimal. Possible reasons for the differences in transmission efficiency between natural regeneration and artificially established progeny plantations mainly include variations in the number of mother trees and crossing patterns in different reproductive seasons. Furthermore, some individuals that grow in the studied progeny plantations may be natural regeneration of the neighboring stands. In light of the obtained results, we discuss the genetic considerations for establishing and using seeds from progeny plantations in Poland."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","uid":"bk6a4u9UDD_o3fTovGAeczg","uuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","name":"Instytut Badawczy Leśnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d0878c28a04739d3df"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","parentUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","rootUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938d878c28a0473aca3a","5e709256878c28a047393e71","5e70939f878c28a0473adf84"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"89","pagesFromTo":"46-55","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938d878c28a0473aca3a","5e709256878c28a047393e71","5e70939f878c28a0473adf84","642fe6b44097074b64683a6b","642fe6b44097074b64683a6c","642fe6b44097074b64683a6d","5e7092d0878c28a04739d3df"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547790b","mniswId":"4926","title":"Dendrobiology","issn":"1641-1307","documentHash":"dc5d141d-ef9a-4b06-be9d-346e75736cd6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"642fe6b44097074b64683a67","year":"2023","volume":"89","documentHash":"6675ec56-fcb8-45bb-8a95-b220cf2ef5ac"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["genetic diversity","microsatellites","natural and artificial regeneration","progeny plantations"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058573324"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bfdbfa40970702a6662ada","name":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Picchio","documentHash":"33b50d95-933b-4a6b-873b-683dccf697cb"},{"objectId":"63bfdbfa40970702a6662ad9","name":"Luigi","lastName":"Pari","documentHash":"d463dcd0-b6d5-4b89-9f52-9763f121ec52"},{"objectId":"63bfdbfa40970702a6662ad8","name":"Pierluca","lastName":"Gaglioppa","documentHash":"856f1a68-e8f8-4c06-a99d-e494b730c483"},{"objectId":"63bfdbfa40970702a6662ad7","name":"Rachele","lastName":"Venanzi","documentHash":"60d05c8d-8dfb-4a03-beeb-6296cfa26673"},{"objectId":"63bfdbfa40970702a6662ad5","name":"Damiano","lastName":"Tocci","documentHash":"0fcf4bce-e2f9-4260-8079-64852504bc65"},{"objectId":"63bfdbfa40970702a6662ad4","name":"Walter","lastName":"Stefanoni","documentHash":"ebef5585-fc16-49f6-a2a0-a774bf4ce0ec"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c999","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Latterini","uuid":"CACEB340446FB4D6658D01649C4614E61499A61641F167AFFBC6344D44E8291B61B43C50E527B5275449413154134E7EACD6FF854AACC44F14ACA9A37487CF08","orcidId":"0000-0001-7401-8754","documentHash":"7c970a18-8b3d-4160-8189-e32a1aab4e44"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63bfdbfa40970702a6662ad2","doi":"10.3390/f14010127","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/14/1/127/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A Preliminary Validation and Assessment of a GIS Approach Related to Precision Forest Harvesting in Central Italy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"There has  been  a  growing  awareness  of the  need  for  sustainable  forest management among  forest  engineers during  the last  decades.  The selection  of the  best  harvesting system  for logging  operations  plays  a  fundamental  role  in  this  effort.  Nowadays,  in  the  decision-making process, forest engineers rely on their own experience, and it is to be expected that their evaluation of the level of appropriateness may be biased. There may be a potential solution to this problem in the  implementation  of  AHP  (Analytic  Hierarchy  Process)  in  the  GIS  (Geographic  Information System) environment.  The  application of  AHP gives  objective information  and thus  reduces the level of bias in deciding which logging harvest system is best to use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of a GIS-AHP approach applied to the development of the harvesting plan of a public forest estate in Central Italy. Three extraction methods were considered: forwarder, cable skidder, and all-terrain cable yarder. Thus, the GIS-AHP model was run by relying on the basic data attainable from the  local  forest  management plan and  then  on  detailed information provided  by field data  collected  from  10 harvested  blocks.  Among these,  in  three  blocks, the  logging  harvest method  was  changed  from  forwarder to  cable skidder.  Statistically significant  differences  were found between the suitability values obtained from the forest management plan and those retrieved from the field surveys for the forwarder and cable skidders but not for all-terrain cable yarders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"127","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bfdbfa40970702a6662ad4","63bfdbfa40970702a6662ad5","62c796a8752340480571c999","63bfdbfa40970702a6662ad7","63bfdbfa40970702a6662ad8","63bfdbfa40970702a6662ad9","63bfdbfa40970702a6662ada"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d36","mniswId":"6744","title":"Forests","issn":"1999-4907","eissn":"1999-4907","documentHash":"05b7b2b7-d675-43a7-91dd-8446464e53a5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bfdbfa40970702a6662ad3","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"1","documentHash":"5c13dda0-272b-4a07-86c4-433577670a11"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Territorial  Information  System","precision  forest  harvesting","forwarder","cable  skidder","cable yarder","timber extraction","forest operations"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058583000"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c669164097071bb531de7c","name":"Peter","lastName":"Lešo","documentHash":"0dac2476-41f5-4b73-a9e3-1cfdf192b27e"},{"objectId":"60c336509543c7233654411f","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Wyka","uuid":"B894DDE1B1FE6BEF557540B85C110CB96E90A96EF8E6536F48A587ECB4D103D20FBEC2F426000780775D515027D750A97FDB1B00E3E688B7BE96BB654393B2F0","documentHash":"705bd2be-1615-481d-bc69-d9ab1c12ba87"},{"objectId":"5e7094ba878c28a0473c29a9","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Piechnik","uuid":"84B4BF73CEB5CA39EC8D454A608399BDB12C9819EE0553833BCB51BE16BFF79AEB9CAB02F273C4524DDB0DF5BB9FE5B20AD929D2D7F68C7F71D76BA3AAD648BD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3958-7393","documentHash":"36d78803-64cd-41a7-941f-0df0ea152661"},{"objectId":"5e70946f878c28a0473bcf1d","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Grzędzicka","uuid":"701CA287F5ACC1A6C3EA9E40321256A4B838F9DC43B16AE3E1A486DFBAAFC5752ECA0A8489670CB98032B3EEACB0AD9DE6379E2998CD4FCE74BE48DD01152E5D","orcidId":"0000-0002-3954-4895","documentHash":"6bbc8675-c44b-4b83-93bd-f5ab51928315"},{"objectId":"5e7093f9878c28a0473b4456","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kajtoch","uuid":"11391FFDD012E31734C94625B7636006240197AC03D2652E680DAB4C732EC59C8EC55624B63D67F3FDACAA4650421DB9F5F5A6F2EE4DBB9E9E47C9FDE5C56617","orcidId":"0000-0001-7345-9400","documentHash":"b1b8385c-d669-4a4e-89a2-45b8ad7db851"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Dyderski","uuid":"BA6020477E5CC315EB2E63B48E152FE36A33E8B3703BEC4812CECBFB0E0E652860C4E0E44BFA87F2AF6998A9580D130FEA7048AFDF4D7E950BC02A1F7F9A3632","orcidId":"0000-0003-4453-2781","documentHash":"6a027753-5078-4ffd-bbdc-95bb2c2a4c00"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63c669164097071bb531de79","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120750","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0378112722007447?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The vertical form of the common ivy Hedera helix L. is associated with diverse and semi-natural forests in Central European highlands","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Understanding the role of epiphytic vegetation and other microhabitats created by plants (hereafter lianas) developing on the surrounding ones is crucial for understanding the functioning of forest communities. Despite the observed increase in the biomass of lianas, the factors connected with forest plant communities determining their occurrence have not been investigated in a temperate zone. This research concerns the determinants of vertical form of the common ivy Hedera helix L. occurrence in highland forests in Central Europe. We established 69 pairs of sites, which consisted of areas inhabited by the vertical form of ivy and control areas (hereafter non-ivy plots). The sites with ivy were characterized by a higher volume (488 m3 ha-1 ± 251 SD vs. 411 m3 ha-1 ± 186 SD), a higher amount of deadwood (34 m3 ha-1 ± 39 SD vs. 23 m3 ha-1 ± 29 SD), and a higher tree species richness (8.0 species/ha ± 2.2 SD vs. 6.8 species/ha ± 2.14 SD) than non-ivy plots. The presence of vertical form of ivy was mainly influenced by a large share of alder in the stand and a higher diversity of trees and shrubs. Moreover, the number of large ivy vines increased with the presence of veteran trees. The presence of gaps was not conducive to the occurrence of large vines. The northern exposure and the presence of deadwood had a positive effect on the number of vines per tree. Our results contribute to the knowledge about variables influencing the occurrence and development of ivy vertical form in forests. The obtained results indicate that ivy requires diverse forests with a mix of trees and numerous veteran ones, which makes this species a good candidate as an indicator of forest habitat quality. We suggest that the common ivy should be protected within its native range and forest patches containing dense ivy vines should be excluded from silviculture."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","uid":"bi0054EFyZHNUwKK3x5HmqA","uuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","name":"Instytut Systematyki i Ewolucji Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c336509543c7233654411f","5e7093f9878c28a0473b4456","5e70946f878c28a0473bcf1d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","parentUuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","rootUuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9b","uid":"bYCUNhDROBwukUMKDm2MWgQ","uuid":"c21fd2c0-91d1-4bec-849c-ed0cf62231ec","name":"Instytut Botaniki im.

This has been with the aim of increasing operational efficiencies, maximizing productivity, and achieving sustainable forest operations. This study surveys the application of data envelopment analysis (DEA), an advanced operations analysis technique, in the broad field of forest engineering, focused on maximizing machinery input usage and productivity as it relates to the harvesting and processing of primary and secondary wood products. The review analyzes DEA journal publications via common online literature databases up until June 2022 with the aim of identifying and synthesizing research progress in the field for beneficial practical business applications.\nRecent Findings: A total of 38 scientific articles were reviewed, and they all emphasized applications of existing DEA models\nas opposed to theoretical development of the models. The forest utilization sector appears to be the predominant area of DEA application in forest engineering practice with the year 2021 having the highest number of publications. Furthermore, conventional DEA models comprising of Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (CCR) and Banker, Chames, and Cooper (BCC) models are the most commonly applied DEA methodological approach, thus resulting in simple technical performance estimates. This is unexpected given that more robust DEA models have been developed over the years. As expected, more attention has been given to the analysis of determinants of efficiency in forest engineering production technologies.\nSummary: Untapped opportunities exist for researchers and practitioners in the application of DEA in forest engineering\nincluding recent derivatives of conventional DEA models, possible development of application suites specifically for forest\nengineering-related operations, and the development of dedicated benchmarking databases with more relevant production\ndata for individual production technologies. This could provide opportunities for data-driven decisions by policy makers\nand managers in terms of harvest contractor selection, technology deployment, sustainability benchmarks, and for improving production efficiency."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"171-186","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["643fb9184097073cb69a776e","643fb9184097073cb69a776f","62c796a8752340480571c999"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bea5","mniswId":"4694","title":"Current Forestry Reports","issn":"2198-6436","eissn":"2198-6436","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"692ce6b3-254b-4b3c-936f-2503724b0da5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6401f26040970777848f89b1","year":"2023","documentHash":"a3a663e4-589c-475a-ac21-fbad17fbeafb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Forest operations","Technical efficiency","Non-parametric frontier","Benchmarking","Productivity measurement"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058643827"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ff33fd4097075fba7219f9","name":"Luigi","lastName":"Pari","documentHash":"cc3949c3-7ae9-450d-bfe2-f9ea7ce6c659"},{"objectId":"63ff33fd4097075fba7219f7","name":"Walter","lastName":"Stefanoni","documentHash":"901ded64-8f33-49ac-ba94-d4f61587d27f"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c999","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Latterini","uuid":"CACEB340446FB4D6658D01649C4614E61499A61641F167AFFBC6344D44E8291B61B43C50E527B5275449413154134E7EACD6FF854AACC44F14ACA9A37487CF08","orcidId":"0000-0001-7401-8754","documentHash":"7c970a18-8b3d-4160-8189-e32a1aab4e44"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ff33fd4097075fba7219f6","doi":"10.3390/en16052303","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/5/2303/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Perennial Grass Species for Bioenergy Production: The State of the Art in Mechanical Harvesting","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Future European strategies to reduce dependence on foreign markets for energy supply and energy production will rely on the further exploitation of the primary sector.

One of the goals of Sustainable Forest Management is to reduce biodiversity disturbance, which can occur as a consequence of timber harvesting. The aim of this review was to defne which silvicultural systems and forest operations can have an infuence on forest tree biodiversity by summarising the fndings of nearly 60 papers published in the last ten years (2013–2022).\nRecent Findings In natural forest ecosystems characterised by a high level of structural complexity, such as uneven-aged tropical forests, selective logging and retention forestry are, in general, suitable forms of intervention that have a limited impact on tree biodiversity. Forest operations, in particular, should be of low intensity and try to simulate as much as possible small-scale natural disturbances. Thinning has proved to be a valid treatment for managing tree biodiversity. However, it is important to shape the magnitude of thinnings according to the management aims. Limited removal is recommended in interventions for maintaining the current structure, and more extensive removal is appropriate in cases when a change in species composition is expected, e.g. in the conversion of planted coniferous stands to uneven-aged mixed or broadleaved stands. In addition, coppicing is suitable for maintaining tree biodiversity due to its efectiveness in fostering the presence of light-demanding tree species. Findings show that it is important to establish the right rotation age, considering that an excessively short period between coppicing interventions can be detrimental to functional biodiversity. Skid trails and landing sites represent suitable areas for the initial establishment of natural regeneration. However, generally, the level of biodiversity on these sites declines with time as a consequence of soil compaction, thus highlighting the importance of the forest infrastructure network planning.\nSummary In uneven-aged tropical forests, selective logging and retention forestry are the most suitable options for maintaining tree biodiversity. Thinning and coppicing help to manage  biodiversity, whilst intensive thinning helps to change species composition. Skid trails and landing sites can support natural regeneration. Recommendations and management options were developed, as well as possible future research directions. The authors recommend that future studies should investigate how much tree biodiversity depends on diferent levels of harvesting technology applied within the same silvicultural treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709346878c28a0473a6358"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"59-71","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c796a8752340480571c999","5e709346878c28a0473a6358","6401f26040970777848f89b4","6401f26040970777848f89b5","6401f26040970777848f89b6","6401f26040970777848f89b7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bea5","mniswId":"4694","title":"Current Forestry Reports","eissn":"2198-6436","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"111550ea-dfba-4e03-ac94-89f9e0575253"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6401f26040970777848f89b1","year":"2023","documentHash":"a3a663e4-589c-475a-ac21-fbad17fbeafb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Harvesting","Sustainable forest management","Selective logging","Retention forestry","Thinning","Coppicing","Skid trails"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058673965"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65ddd0fc4097076263c7b888","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Woźniak","documentHash":"dad1d3fe-f3e8-49cf-9a04-6e3646664a2c"},{"objectId":"65ddd0fc4097076263c7b885","name":"Jawdat","lastName":"Bakr","documentHash":"95c39155-6a19-42c0-a18d-5cde7713e408"},{"objectId":"65ddd0fc4097076263c7b884","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Jendrzejek","documentHash":"e75b6660-34b4-43d7-9c06-1fcc3a35aacf"},{"objectId":"65ddd0fc4097076263c7b883","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Hutniczak","documentHash":"fe2ebe30-a31a-460e-843f-683adb69eba8"},{"objectId":"65ddd0fc4097076263c7b882","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kompała-Bąba","documentHash":"81fbb09a-f371-4f8f-94ad-5af4dbf61e96"},{"objectId":"65ddd0fc4097076263c7b881","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Błońska","documentHash":"f598de38-9721-4d02-a19b-d3a50686a832"},{"objectId":"65ddd0fc4097076263c7b880","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Bierza","documentHash":"06a53b06-daff-43bd-a90e-f1e97729b941"},{"objectId":"5e70934d878c28a0473a6de6","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Prostański","uuid":"7E8AB27B6A8FD0B2862B9CC6FBA2FBE556FD3CC359ACA352D350820FE173DDE955368ED92F30021904FB6B3050DE2A81B431967A38CD156FDBD5C3E9B7F7D0F5","orcidId":"0000-0002-9047-9646","documentHash":"55c65c95-02f0-4862-b0b3-191ab33d92a1"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"03F14E2076FEABB44CC7B743F6FD9B59C0B3CE3F788CFE10E84226C037F019164ED6EE4E61A04DD072E5640611915200DC9689ED62B57A29F869C4D59C6D63FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-0985","documentHash":"002defbf-325a-404d-a301-7cc974eec233"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739ff2f","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Czarnecka","uuid":"FFF8A498F045A13E68E889FAA055C9B44B157579B560504384D7AA581F57C40BE38141236C0842BC4AB36F57F65D1D02CE5E54A25ECE36D09A83A9F837CBB6CC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6358-2915","documentHash":"ba544ccf-4e6a-4296-b510-4775310a518c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"645b4b3b4097073c5b759b3e","doi":"10.3390/su15097284","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/9/7284","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Plant Diversity and Species Composition in Relation to Soil Enzymatic Activity in the Novel Ecosystems of Urban–Industrial Landscapes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The primary producers and processes of matter and energy flow, reflected by the soil enzyme activity, are the basics of all ecosystem functioning processes. This paper reviews the relationships between the plant diversity, the physicochemical substrate parameters, and the soil enzymatic activity in novel ecosystems of the urban–industrial landscape, where the factors driving soil enzyme activity are not fully understood and still need to be studied. The relationship between the biotic and abiotic factors in the development of novel ecosystems on de novo established habitats, e.g., sites of post-mineral excavation, are shaped in ways unknown from the natural and the semi-natural habitats. The main criteria of de novo established ecosystems are the vegetation patches of the non-analogous species composition created as a result of human impact. The non-analogous species assemblages are associated with different microorganism communities because the biomass and the biochemistry of soil organic matter influence the enzyme activity of soil substrates. Moreover, the soil enzyme activity is an indicator that can dynamically reflect the changes in the microbial community structure dependent on the best-adapted plant species, thanks to the particular traits and individual adaptive adjustments of all the plant species present. This way, soil enzyme activity reflects the sum and the interactions of the elements of the ecosystem structure, irrespective of the vegetation history and the habitat origin."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709195878c28a04737f723","uid":"bFx_aJwdq28ivBe-OSOfEWQ","uuid":"9ca024e5-9515-4af9-85e0-02ab32d3d65d","name":"Instytut Techniki Górniczej KOMAG","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934d878c28a0473a6de6"],"parentId":"5e709195878c28a04737f723","parentUuid":"9ca024e5-9515-4af9-85e0-02ab32d3d65d","rootId":"5e709195878c28a04737f723","rootUuid":"9ca024e5-9515-4af9-85e0-02ab32d3d65d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709346878c28a0473a62d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"7284","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65ddd0fc4097076263c7b880","5e7092f5878c28a04739ff2f","65ddd0fc4097076263c7b881","65ddd0fc4097076263c7b882","65ddd0fc4097076263c7b883","65ddd0fc4097076263c7b884","65ddd0fc4097076263c7b885","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","5e70934d878c28a0473a6de6","65ddd0fc4097076263c7b888"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["soil dehydrogenase","soil phosphatase","soil substratum","physicochemical parameters","ruderal sites","vegetation","coal mine heaps"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058681003"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6479aaf04097070bf8639863","name":"Kazimierz","lastName":"Chwistek","documentHash":"8a24be35-3d4e-4456-afae-96b3b62291a8"},{"objectId":"5e709420878c28a0473b6a31","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pawlik","uuid":"131618153DCF857EFC305BDD0B059C035F7CE186DD89FA2C3AE74B64F2F739CF2EA4CE31647E277D29334A640230FED2952E396E31026ECF6058520B99AD07E8","orcidId":"0000-0001-9271-3507","documentHash":"e1928eb3-6591-4491-8ff2-6178ba29dc9f"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Dyderski","uuid":"BA6020477E5CC315EB2E63B48E152FE36A33E8B3703BEC4812CECBFB0E0E652860C4E0E44BFA87F2AF6998A9580D130FEA7048AFDF4D7E950BC02A1F7F9A3632","orcidId":"0000-0003-4453-2781","documentHash":"6a027753-5078-4ffd-bbdc-95bb2c2a4c00"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fae4","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Czarnota","uuid":"2C0535FE28EC3FE9D647316ABCF879F2BA26E23BBFA9F279C89E7F6D9B9075719A8EA0F400074D07250687F24AC75F57E21FA73E3EFCD66350510F3447068F4B","orcidId":"0000-0002-1515-6214","documentHash":"3ecb27f4-f26d-4c13-b967-de1fe4ec8b07"}],"objectId":"6479aaf04097070bf8639861","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121054","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378112723002888","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Tree aboveground biomass increment and mortality in temperate mountain forests: Tracing dynamic changes along 25-year monitoring period","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tree aboveground biomass and its increment are sensitive forest and landscape dynamics indicators.

We used a unique database consisting of information collected between 1992 and 2017 (in 5-year intervals) within 389 permanent monitoring plots regularly distributed in the GNP area. This allowed us to calculate tree biomass and its increments and model them using a set of explanatory variables: proportion of particular tree species, mean temperature of the coldest quarter (bio11), mean precipitation of the warmest quarter (bio18), elevation, topographic wetness index (TWI), stand basal area (BA), diameter heterogeneity expressed by the coefficient of variation (DBH CV), and conservation regime. We applied generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs), assuming the beta distribution of response variables, i.e. biomass proportions of increment, recruitment, and mortality of three main tree species: Norway spruce Picea abies (L.) Karst, European beech Fagus sylvatica L., and silver fir Abies alba Mill. In a large part of the GNP area, tree biomass increased. In the central and southern parts of the park, tree mortality was higher than in other parts, especially between 2002 and 2007, due to bark beetle outbreaks and intense wind damage. Stand dynamics of all species depended mainly on species proportion in stand biomass. The increment of Abies alba increased with TWI but decreased with BA and DBH CV. Recruitment decreased with BA and slope but increased with TWI and DBH CV, while mortality decreased with DBH CV and TWI. For Fagus sylvatica, increment increased with TWI but decreased with BA, elevation, and bio18, while recruitment decreased with BA and increased with TWI. Mortality decreased with DBH CV, bio11, and TWI but increased with BA. Picea abies increment increased with elevation but decreased with BA, slope, and DBH CV and weakly increased with bio11. Recruitment increased with TWI but decreased with BA and DBH CV, while mortality decreased with DBH CV, BA, and bio18. Water retention at the plot level, approximated by TWI, decreased mortality and increased recruitment of the studied species. Therefore, it can serve as an indicator of suitable microsites for their persistence. In addition, the increment was lower in strictly protected forests, while mortality was higher. Our study provided quantitative evidence of how climate, geomorphology, and forest stand characteristics modify stand dynamics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709420878c28a0473b6a31"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709214878c28a04738fae4"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"540","pagesFromTo":"121054","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e709420878c28a0473b6a31","6479aaf04097070bf8639863","5e709214878c28a04738fae4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d2e","mniswId":"6734","title":"FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","issn":"0378-1127","documentHash":"37771705-8204-4376-a5d9-e8d43ad82b3e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6479aaf04097070bf8639862","year":"2023","volume":"540","documentHash":"1bb83e29-f27f-486c-8e21-805ac7b62d16"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tree biomass","recruitment","Abies alba","Fagus sylvatica","picea abies","modelling","monitoring","climate change","geomorphology","forest dynamic","forest ecology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058710774"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64a578664097077a61375c68","name":"Katharina","lastName":"Lapin","documentHash":"b186c0c8-fe89-4dba-9bdd-6d54eac33b85"},{"objectId":"64a578664097077a61375c67","name":"Rachele","lastName":"Venanzi","documentHash":"a794bd06-9d88-4b1a-96f3-d352f11b95cf"},{"objectId":"64a578664097077a61375c66","name":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Picchio","documentHash":"e021fc33-3544-4665-8dcf-9d2fa833d8fe"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c999","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Latterini","uuid":"CACEB340446FB4D6658D01649C4614E61499A61641F167AFFBC6344D44E8291B61B43C50E527B5275449413154134E7EACD6FF854AACC44F14ACA9A37487CF08","orcidId":"0000-0001-7401-8754","documentHash":"7c970a18-8b3d-4160-8189-e32a1aab4e44"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c026c","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Horodecki","uuid":"7F70C73730CEB5DD7E6741FECB12A65A529DDB966478C8334018A31EFF9EC4C7D25A06154BC87F2F9E8D4FFB6D9B1E6C8CFDD4614F20DCAAABA7EBDD573645DB","orcidId":"0000-0002-7789-8723","documentHash":"4e3b185a-8e56-4c89-b7ea-a9b8d334f566"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"03F14E2076FEABB44CC7B743F6FD9B59C0B3CE3F788CFE10E84226C037F019164ED6EE4E61A04DD072E5640611915200DC9689ED62B57A29F869C4D59C6D63FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-0985","documentHash":"002defbf-325a-404d-a301-7cc974eec233"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Dyderski","uuid":"BA6020477E5CC315EB2E63B48E152FE36A33E8B3703BEC4812CECBFB0E0E652860C4E0E44BFA87F2AF6998A9580D130FEA7048AFDF4D7E950BC02A1F7F9A3632","orcidId":"0000-0003-4453-2781","documentHash":"6a027753-5078-4ffd-bbdc-95bb2c2a4c00"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"64a578664097077a61375c62","doi":"10.1007/s40725-023-00190-5","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40725-023-00190-5.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Effects of Forest Operations and Silvicultural Treatments on Litter Decomposition Rate: a Meta-analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose of Review: As litter decomposition is a fundamental process in forest ecosystems, representing the link between\naboveground and belowground biogeochemical processes, we developed an effect size summarisation of the implications\nof forest management on litter decomposition rate, by applying a multi-level meta-analysis and multivariate mixed-effects\nmeta-analytic linear models. Our aim was to review the findings of the current literature and to understand how forest management, silvicultural treatment, and forest operations could affect litter decomposition rate. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of environmental variables that included stand type, climatic conditions, and the percentage of biomass removal on litter decomposition rate.\nRecent Findings: We found a statistically significant reduction in litter decomposition rate associated with clear-cutting, and\nno statistically significant differences for the overall effects of retention forestry and logging activities (disturbed forest soil\nin the form of skid trails or strip roads). Concerning the sub-group analysis and multivariate meta-regression, there were\nno significant effects for stand type (broadleaf, coniferous, or mixed) or climatic conditions (mean annual temperature and\nannual precipitation). The percentage of biomass removal showed a significant positive correlation with the effect size, thus\nindicating that higher biomass removal in the framework of retention forestry leads to an increase in litter decomposition rate. Also, the mesh size of the litterbag showed a positive correlation with the effect size, suggesting that there is a probability of a factor of stronger disturbance to large-body decomposer organisms such as microarthropods.\nSummary Litter: decomposition rate is related, among other factors, to soil microclimatic conditions and soil biota. Therefore, this process can be strongly influenced by active forest management, meant as a silvicultural treatment carried out by applying a given harvesting system. In the context of retention forestry, increased light availability seems to be the driving force in shaping increased litter decomposition rates with increasing biomass removal. On the other hand, when a clear-cut is applied, the stronger modification to the edaphic community leads to decreased litter decomposition rates. It is worth noting that the modification may also be related to soil manipulation to favour the establishment of artificial regeneration. The findings, however, showed very large variability, thus suggesting the need for further research on such a complex topic. Multidisciplinary studies that analyse the microclimate and the edaphic biological communities along with the litter decomposition are particularly recommended."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","5e709499878c28a0473c026c","62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"276-290","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c796a8752340480571c999","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e709499878c28a0473c026c","64a578664097077a61375c66","64a578664097077a61375c67","64a578664097077a61375c68","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bea5","mniswId":"4694","title":"Current Forestry Reports","issn":"2198-6436","eissn":"2198-6436","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"692ce6b3-254b-4b3c-936f-2503724b0da5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6401f26040970777848f89b1","year":"2023","documentHash":"a3a663e4-589c-475a-ac21-fbad17fbeafb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sustainable Forest Management","Sustainable Forest Operations","Reduced-Impact Logging","Retention Forestry","Clear-cut"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058714529"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c34e5f9543c72336544474","name":"Quadri","lastName":"Anibaba","uuid":"E054E1E07A82108713D59567A7381EF6418D06B291A8B6CF2F865211D533AC1AB08A87C84A4E7328A403AC6DE26F4F75CCC8091EB318925B67A820DDBA661A13","orcidId":"0000-0002-5195-2920","documentHash":"940abcd3-f5c9-4ace-a878-dea83fbd8b57"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"03F14E2076FEABB44CC7B743F6FD9B59C0B3CE3F788CFE10E84226C037F019164ED6EE4E61A04DD072E5640611915200DC9689ED62B57A29F869C4D59C6D63FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-0985","documentHash":"002defbf-325a-404d-a301-7cc974eec233"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f022","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"2D9FBD547ED5A35CF5E1E8D2C5DD7679C3C0131E7732BE3AC783A27D55AC85FF0DA6826E6609ED403B95EF9697D29BDBD2B4621647DA0B5DEB0701E6C4E2184A","orcidId":"0000-0003-1936-2880","documentHash":"9db4886c-beb8-4af7-a752-7933a8390aa4"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Dyderski","uuid":"BA6020477E5CC315EB2E63B48E152FE36A33E8B3703BEC4812CECBFB0E0E652860C4E0E44BFA87F2AF6998A9580D130FEA7048AFDF4D7E950BC02A1F7F9A3632","orcidId":"0000-0003-4453-2781","documentHash":"6a027753-5078-4ffd-bbdc-95bb2c2a4c00"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64b6377f4097072492af0e59","doi":"10.3897/neobiota.85.97269","publicUri":"https://neobiota.pensoft.net/article/97269/download/pdf/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Native plant community characteristics explain alien species success in post-industrial vegetation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biological invasions are one of the major challenges to the restoration of post-mining sites. Most post-mining sites are under technical reclamation with only a few left to spontaneous vegetation processes. Therefore, we know little about alien plant species on spontaneously-vegetated post-coal mine heaps and how native community characteristics predict their establishment. To fill the knowledge gap, we aimed to determine the drivers of alien species colonisation on post-coal mine heaps. Specifically, we asked: (i) Which alien species are the most successful on post-coal mine heaps and why? (ii) What are the drivers of alien species richness and cover, and how are they affected by the native community? (iii) What does it mean for predicting threats from alien species and management? We recorded vascular plant species and their abundance across 400 plots on post-coal mine heaps in Upper Silesia, Poland. We calculated plant community taxonomic and functional characteristics and, using mixed-effects models, we estimated predictors of alien species richness and cover. We found 65 alien species on post-coal mine heaps, comprising 20.4% of all recorded species, including 36 neophytes and 29 archaeophytes. Amongst them – Erigeron canadensis, Solidago gigantea, Solidago canadensis, Erigeron annuus and Impatiens parviflora – were the most frequent on the studied heaps. We showed that native functional richness significantly predicts alien species richness and cover. Similarly, native community-weighted mean (CWM) seed mass and plant height predict alien species cover. However, CWM of specific leaf area for native species marginally predicts alien species richness. We showed that alien species cover decreases with native species cover. Our findings revealed the ecological significance of niche-filling and the biotic acceptance hypotheses on post-coal mine heaps. We demonstrated how exploring native community characteristics can help in understanding the invasibility and management of post-industrial vegetation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e7878c28a04739f022"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","60c34e5f9543c72336544474"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"85","pagesFromTo":"1-22","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c34e5f9543c72336544474","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e7092e7878c28a04739f022","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5b878c28514547cd6f","mniswId":"14874","title":"NeoBiota","issn":"1619-0033","eissn":"1314-2488","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"b2e0acd7-876e-492a-a15d-7bfa82292144"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biological invasions","coal mines","community-weighted means","functional diversity","native species","oligotrophic mineral material","post-coal mine heaps"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058739423"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64a173d54097072ba2af294e","name":"Giulio","lastName":"Sperandio","documentHash":"4552c1d4-6aec-49bc-8b8d-5913cf4a191d"},{"objectId":"64a173d54097072ba2af294c","name":"Stefano","lastName":"Benigni","documentHash":"bc54f4aa-1978-47de-9c33-09af7bbaaf03"},{"objectId":"64a173d54097072ba2af294b","name":"Renato","lastName":"Grilli","documentHash":"eb532f31-0ecf-415e-8b18-f0f6d677d7ed"},{"objectId":"64a173d54097072ba2af294a","name":"Laura","lastName":"Fornaciari","documentHash":"b808acb8-213e-41fe-b9be-e78739ee1fea"},{"objectId":"64a173d54097072ba2af2949","name":"Daniele","lastName":"Pochi","documentHash":"182a394b-b351-483d-822f-a2b82e7fb40d"},{"objectId":"64a173d54097072ba2af2948","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Fanigliulo","documentHash":"90df05ca-2b06-4571-b675-b36c413c6b3c"},{"objectId":"64a173d54097072ba2af2947","name":"Walter","lastName":"Stefanoni","documentHash":"73a6f121-5e6f-4419-b2cf-9f1f12b31a44"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c999","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Latterini","uuid":"CACEB340446FB4D6658D01649C4614E61499A61641F167AFFBC6344D44E8291B61B43C50E527B5275449413154134E7EACD6FF854AACC44F14ACA9A37487CF08","orcidId":"0000-0001-7401-8754","documentHash":"7c970a18-8b3d-4160-8189-e32a1aab4e44"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"64a173d54097072ba2af2946","doi":"10.3390/f14071358","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/14/7/1358/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Assessment of Energy, Dynamic and Economic Balance of Chipping Operation in Poplar Medium Rotation Coppice (MRC) Plantations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Exploiting renewable energy sources is one of the main strategies deﬁned by the EU to over-come dependence on foreign markets for energy supply. Wood fuel sourced from the agroforestry sec-tor can contribute signiﬁcantly to achieving the goal, though its economic and environmental sustain-ability is intimately dependent on proper harvesting and chipping operations. In the present article,both economic and environmental aspects of Medium Rotation Coppice (MRC) were investigated re-garding chipping. A small-scale chipper and tractor were equipped with real-time sensors to monitortime, t(s); fuel consumption, F(cm3); PTO torque, M(daNm); PTO speed, s(min−1); and stem diame-ter, D(mm) during the comminution of 61 poplar plants (gathered in 5 classes according to trunk diam-eter) grown in MRC system. More than 29,000 records were taken and analyzed. Predictive models forworking time, working productivity, CO2emission, energy consumption, fuel consumption and costswere also produced. Higher diametric classes exhibited lower fuel consumption, less CO2emissionand less energy demand during chipping. Time and operating costs were statistically different amongclasses, with minimum values of0.22 (SD ±0.02) h·Mg−1and12.07 (SD ±0.93) €·Mg−1in class 5and maximum values of0.64 (SD ±0.09) h·Mg−1and35.34 (SD ±4.88) €·Mg−1in class 1, respec-tively. Fuel consumption ranges from3.04 (SD ±0.88) L·Mg−1in class 5 to7.32 (SD ±1.46) L·Mg−1in class 1. The lowest CO2emission of 8.03 (SD±2.32) kg·Mg−1was found class 5. However, thetotal cost of coppice production did not exceed large-scale MRC production due to the lower purchaseprice of the machinery involved. Eventually, predictive models showed high reliability as estimatingtools for important variables, such as working time, working productivity, CO2emissions, energyconsumption, fuel consumption and costs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1358","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64a173d54097072ba2af2947","64a173d54097072ba2af2948","64a173d54097072ba2af2949","64a173d54097072ba2af294a","64a173d54097072ba2af294b","64a173d54097072ba2af294c","62c796a8752340480571c999","64a173d54097072ba2af294e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d36","mniswId":"6744","title":"Forests","issn":"1999-4907","eissn":"1999-4907","documentHash":"05b7b2b7-d675-43a7-91dd-8446464e53a5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"649d7b3740970720a8607654","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"7","documentHash":"c15e2a79-b36a-4928-b7bb-3bdc030622c2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["comminution","work productivity","sustainable forest operations","bioenergy","wood chips"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058753362"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64a1739f4097072ba2af28bb","name":"Luigi","lastName":"Pari","documentHash":"adb89c1b-fc2a-402c-96ad-e95618728782"},{"objectId":"64a1739f4097072ba2af28ba","name":"Leonardo","lastName":"Bianchini","documentHash":"bb9c864d-0588-420e-a6e0-989eefbdfca3"},{"objectId":"64a1739f4097072ba2af28b9","name":"Walter","lastName":"Stefanoni","documentHash":"69d46dc0-26f0-4189-8be2-3054e640f1e0"},{"objectId":"64a1739f4097072ba2af28b8","name":"Rachele","lastName":"Venanzi","documentHash":"83cb0120-0d90-4737-b9d8-c72b264a9bb7"},{"objectId":"64a1739f4097072ba2af28b7","name":"Luca","lastName":"Cozzolino","documentHash":"a00939b9-6d6f-444e-a157-607d36444d83"},{"objectId":"64a1739f4097072ba2af28b6","name":"Nicolò","lastName":"Di Marzio","documentHash":"d7e7f669-5095-44cc-971b-16308f508762"},{"objectId":"64a1739f4097072ba2af28b5","name":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Picchio","documentHash":"4a3bec07-a5a6-41ee-ac61-d3c560ff8b7d"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c999","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Latterini","uuid":"CACEB340446FB4D6658D01649C4614E61499A61641F167AFFBC6344D44E8291B61B43C50E527B5275449413154134E7EACD6FF854AACC44F14ACA9A37487CF08","orcidId":"0000-0001-7401-8754","documentHash":"7c970a18-8b3d-4160-8189-e32a1aab4e44"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"64a1739f4097072ba2af28b4","doi":"10.3390/ma16134689","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/13/4689/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Pellet Production from Pruning and Alternative Forest Biomass: A Review of the Most Recent Research Findings","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Typically, coniferous sawdust from debarked stems is used to make pellets. Given the high lignin content, which ensures strong binding and high calorific values, this feedstock provides the best quality available. However, finding alternative feedstocks for pellet production is crucial if small-scale pellet production is to be developed and used to support the economy and energy independence of rural communities. These communities have to be able to create pellets devoid of\nadditives and without biomass pre-processing so that the feedstock price remains low. The features of pellets made from other sources of forest biomass, such as different types of waste, broadleaf species, and pruning biomass, have attracted some attention in this context. This review sought to provide an overview of the most recent (2019–2023) knowledge on the subject and to bring into consideration potential feedstocks for the growth of small-scale pellet production. Findings from the literature show that poor bulk density and mechanical durability are the most frequent issues when making pellets\nfrom different feedstocks. All of the tested alternative biomass typologies have these shortcomings, which are also a result of the use of low-performance pelletizers in small-scale production, preventing the achievement of adequate mechanical qualities. Pellets made from pruning biomass, coniferous residues, and wood from short-rotation coppice plants all have significant flaws in terms of ash content and, in some cases, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine content as well. All things considered, research suggests that broadleaf wood from beech and oak trees, collected through routine forest\nmanagement activities, makes the best feasible feedstock for small-scale pellet production. Despite having poor mechanical qualities, these feedstocks can provide pellets with a low ash level. High ash content is a significant disadvantage when considering pellet manufacture and use on a small scale since it can significantly raise maintenance costs, compromising the supply chain’s ability to operate cost-effectively. Pellets with low bulk density and low mechanical durability can be successfully used in a small-scale supply chain with the advantages of reducing travel distance from the production site and storage time."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"4689","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64a1739f4097072ba2af28b5","64a1739f4097072ba2af28b6","64a1739f4097072ba2af28b7","64a1739f4097072ba2af28b8","64a1739f4097072ba2af28b9","64a1739f4097072ba2af28ba","64a1739f4097072ba2af28bb","62c796a8752340480571c999"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"649a8b64409707195f005a36","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"13","documentHash":"b97989d9-cb2f-4d95-86a8-e7ac1bdb4325"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bark","lignocellulosic biomass","bioenergy","renewable energy","short-rotation coppice"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058753545"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65ab9fe8409707197755536b","name":"Thomas W.","lastName":"Crowther","documentHash":"cbfc7e64-7bc0-4e97-8b90-fcebc7f6b67e"},{"objectId":"65ab9fe8409707197755536a","name":"Irie Casimir","lastName":"Zo‐Bi","documentHash":"f1ca05d7-03a7-4f57-8dc6-65e8a6f7891c"},{"objectId":"65ab9fe84097071977555369","name":"Zhi‐Xin","lastName":"Zhu","documentHash":"30f67a43-dba1-4991-81a3-7e699e8265b7"},{"objectId":"65ab9fe84097071977555368","name":"Mo","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"a2d4b220-f78f-4e36-aa18-ca8519d7e9b6"},{"objectId":"65ab9fe84097071977555367","name":"Xiuhai","lastName":"Zhao","documentHash":"4670d2b0-071e-4caa-b904-2a4ac30bc017"},{"objectId":"65ab9fe84097071977555366","name":"Chunyu","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"4bfb77af-6bdb-4a72-b647-dafac16ef8b4"},{"objectId":"65ab9fe84097071977555365","name":"Roderick","lastName":"Zagt","documentHash":"021c2494-93d6-4f1a-9762-7716f083f0a8"},{"objectId":"65ab9fe84097071977555364","name":"Verginia","lastName":"Wortel","documentHash":"7de70d9b-926f-4403-bb82-805b703cc1e0"},{"objectId":"65ab9fe84097071977555363","name":"Florian","lastName":"Wittmann","documentHash":"68be7b9e-0ff0-4a3d-96e6-3776b5848f42"},{"objectId":"65ab9fe84097071977555362","name":"Susan K.","lastName":"Wiser","documentHash":"0933b8da-13d9-448a-a3a3-f44bb384b3cd"},{"objectId":"65ab9fe84097071977555361","name":"Gijsbert D.

Biodiversity is an important component of natural ecosystems, with higher species richness often correlating with an increase in ecosystem productivity. Yet, this relationship varies substantially across environments, typically becoming less pronounced at high levels of species richness. However, species richness alone cannot reflect all important properties of a community, including community evenness, which may mediate the relationship between biodiversity and productivity. If the evenness of a community correlates negatively with richness across forests globally, then a greater number of species may not always increase overall diversity and productivity of the system. Theoretical work and local empirical studies have shown that the effect of evenness on ecosystem functioning may be especially strong at high richness levels, yet the consistency of this remains untested at a global scale.</jats:p><jats:p>2. Here, we used a dataset of forests from across the globe, which includes composition, biomass accumulation and net primary productivity, to explore whether productivity correlates with community evenness and richness in a way that evenness appears to buffer the effect of richness. Specifically, we evaluated whether low levels of evenness in speciose communities correlate with the attenuation of the richness–productivity relationship.</jats:p><jats:p>3. We found that tree species richness and evenness are negatively correlated across forests globally, with highly speciose forests typically comprising a few dominant and many rare species. Furthermore, we found that the correlation between diversity and productivity changes with evenness: at low richness, uneven communities are more productive, while at high richness, even communities are more productive.</jats:p><jats:p>4. <jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Collectively, these results demonstrate that evenness is an integral component of the relationship between biodiversity and productivity, and that the attenuating effect of richness on forest productivity might be partly explained by low evenness in speciose communities. Productivity generally increases with species richness, until reduced evenness limits the overall increases in community diversity. Our research suggests that evenness is a fundamental component of biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships, and is of critical importance for guiding conservation and sustainable ecosystem management decisions.</jats:p>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział

of soil mites (Acari: Mesostigmata) in streamside mountain forests","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the most influential factors responsible for recent biodiversity decline. The key to understanding the changes in ecosystem functioning is the analysis of the relationship between species diversity and environmental gradients such as those found near streamside forests. We used soil mites (Mesostigmata) as model species as they are predators in soil ecosystems, they occur in high relative abundance, their communities are species-rich and are robust toward sampling and extraction methods. The main goals of this study were to (1) check how the plant community and associated environmental variables (light conditions, litter accumulation, and soil acidity) along mountain streams affect soil Mesostigmata abundance and diversity, and (2) to analyze the distance from mountain streams to which the ecosystem functions (Mesostigmata diversity) are affected, based on a distance gradient. We systematically established 31 study plots (500 m2) every 200 m along the watercourses, representing three habitat types along the stand composition gradient (ash-sycamore [Fraxinus excelsior–Acer pseudoplatanus], European beech [Fagus sylvatica], and Norway spruce [Picea abies] forests) for measurements of soil litter thickness, soil acidity, and light conditions. We extracted soil Mesostigmata mites from samples in Tullgren funnels and identified them to the species level. We found that Mesostigmata abundance in forests decreased in the following order: Norway spruce forest > European beech forest > ash-sycamore forest. Additionally, changes in Shannon diversity were associated with light conditions. In conclusion, streamside mountain forests maintained abundant, diverse and species-rich Mesostigmata communities, which were associated with a plant community-light condition gradient. Additionally, more abundant mite communities occurred in forests with higher soil pH values, and under higher light conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","5e709499878c28a0473c026c","5ffebd42085dcb0e357dcd28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6401","5e709346878c28a0473a62e4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"34","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"4046-4056","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709346878c28a0473a62e4","5e709347878c28a0473a6401","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e709499878c28a0473c026c","5ffebd42085dcb0e357dcd28","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c79","mniswId":"13433","title":"Land Degradation and Development","issn":"1085-3278","eissn":"1099-145X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4780d70e-689d-4936-9755-0109bd83c6cb"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mite assemblages","mountain river","riparian forest","soil pH","tree species effect"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058791752"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64945be2409707544f64654a","name":"Zygmunt","lastName":"Stanula","documentHash":"2d74dba7-d23d-4dd6-9364-d8bce0cd936f"},{"objectId":"64945be2409707544f646549","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Smarul","documentHash":"bd8be669-650a-48a2-8eb7-5c296c4fa7e2"},{"objectId":"64945be2409707544f646547","name":"Karol","lastName":"Tomczak","documentHash":"05c0a893-a46e-4206-bbda-85a7e8178a55"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c999","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Latterini","uuid":"CACEB340446FB4D6658D01649C4614E61499A61641F167AFFBC6344D44E8291B61B43C50E527B5275449413154134E7EACD6FF854AACC44F14ACA9A37487CF08","orcidId":"0000-0001-7401-8754","documentHash":"7c970a18-8b3d-4160-8189-e32a1aab4e44"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6456","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Tomczak","uuid":"D5A64868BB07704E2A2225D5DB3CD470F94D2714F05704C8766D4C4B23F4BC257383F4F32A1C22669FAEAB423DB2C319574437FDC7DED5DC47876D88397D3D3A","orcidId":"0000-0003-1140-8282","documentHash":"29ea8233-08f8-4cc6-b1bf-837a95e905e2"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6376","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Łakomy","uuid":"DD79DD040B8464462602C6833A323DCF6EC97F0D7BE04911DE8D7C3885B008FA5F1AA51C394AE5C53AC5C86D391A98DEAE0B3AF87BA295E16D61F612540A01CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1510-6217","documentHash":"234a0c14-841a-47e5-b98a-e9df76e20146"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a6296","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Jelonek","uuid":"966EB6479482B80DB5BF88B09D8265A0646FDB88E9FAB75ABB3ACAB1F9A12C28E5CA50D284823CDAA7016F4A2F0042CA61D2EDDCE9F6E32D0B5F388F3CFE3BD8","orcidId":"0000-0001-9558-9951","documentHash":"655f2f9a-7717-44e2-9d4a-fe8ede7add11"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390828","name":"Robert","lastName":"Kuźmiński","uuid":"A846E54C64845D29FB5316203BBA9C4430DB9D966947F084A9B98480C293DBCD613451C29422D25B9AE9DEECE8B8F3A8588B5AFB19CEA4E49A9691DD8B25704B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3958-1503","documentHash":"ed62b8fe-25c5-4e72-9212-f31fa7938e5c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"64945be2409707544f646545","doi":"10.3390/f14061276","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/14/6/1276/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Moisture Content of Fresh Scots Pine Wood in Areas near Damage Caused by Harvester Head Feed Rollers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"By damaging bark, mechanized harvesting deprives wood of its natural mechanical barrier. This study concerns the effect of this damage on the changes in moisture content that occur near the damaged areas of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). This study was carried out using 45 randomly selected 11 m long logged pine stems. Additionally, the effect of bark thickness on the depth of damage was measured. To determine the influence of the location of the damage and bark thickness on the wood moisture near the damaged region, wood samples were collected from two sections. The first was located one meter above the log’s base, while the second was located one meter from the end of the log. Two increment cores were taken by a Pressler borer in each section: one from the damaged wood zone and the second from the undamaged wood zone. The average bark thickness one meter from the base of the log was 11.2 mm, which decreased to 1.8 mm in the samples taken one meter from the top of the log. The average depths of the damage caused by feed roller spikes in the two sections were 3.9 and 3.8 mm, respectively, indicating that there was no significant effect of bark thickness on the depth of the damage. The wood samples collected near the damaged wood zone (DW) had about 13 percent lower moisture content than those taken from the undamaged zone (UDW). This difference was statistically significant. We observed greater mean moisture content closer to the top of the log for both the samples taken near the damaged zone and the samples taken from the undamaged zone. One meter from the base of the log, the moisture content difference between the DW and UDW was 9.8 percentage points, which was statistically insignificant. By contrast, significantly lower moisture content (−16%) was observed in the DW one meter from the top of the log."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6376","5e709347878c28a0473a6456","5e709224878c28a047390828","5e709346878c28a0473a6296"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1276","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64945be2409707544f646547","62c796a8752340480571c999","64945be2409707544f646549","64945be2409707544f64654a","5e709346878c28a0473a6296","5e709224878c28a047390828","5e709347878c28a0473a6376","5e709347878c28a0473a6456"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d36","mniswId":"6744","title":"Forests","issn":"1999-4907","eissn":"1999-4907","documentHash":"05b7b2b7-d675-43a7-91dd-8446464e53a5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64945be2409707544f646546","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"6","documentHash":"98ab0803-b84e-4995-b35f-bac7611dbd29"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["timber","mechanized harvesting","wood moisture","blue stain","wood defects"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058814666"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64f833de4097076d8859f8cf","name":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Picchio","documentHash":"a56f884e-a148-4e83-9cb9-ed47416733dd"},{"objectId":"64f833de4097076d8859f8ce","name":"Rachele","lastName":"Venanzi","documentHash":"8a9235a1-fe88-4e1e-a193-6c95b955d669"},{"objectId":"64f833de4097076d8859f8cd","name":"Lars","lastName":"Högbom","documentHash":"18b2c4a6-a097-458f-b91f-48bf4f13cc0a"},{"objectId":"64f833de4097076d8859f8cc","name":"Walter","lastName":"Stefanoni","documentHash":"7019c36c-bfb3-4924-8a82-a556dfec836c"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c999","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Latterini","uuid":"CACEB340446FB4D6658D01649C4614E61499A61641F167AFFBC6344D44E8291B61B43C50E527B5275449413154134E7EACD6FF854AACC44F14ACA9A37487CF08","orcidId":"0000-0001-7401-8754","documentHash":"7c970a18-8b3d-4160-8189-e32a1aab4e44"},{"objectId":"5ffebd42085dcb0e357dcd28","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Rawlik","uuid":"650EDCAF2566F3DE1BDC37442DBC9D74B15FD23887DB7ED9EFE77D05491E679A821EF507C11DB1262954B13D6343B9A5F3574D11A868F347318E7F2D4360FB8D","orcidId":"0000-0003-4177-7396","documentHash":"dbc9cf78-2bde-47af-a3ff-184635d49a17"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c026c","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Horodecki","uuid":"7F70C73730CEB5DD7E6741FECB12A65A529DDB966478C8334018A31EFF9EC4C7D25A06154BC87F2F9E8D4FFB6D9B1E6C8CFDD4614F20DCAAABA7EBDD573645DB","orcidId":"0000-0002-7789-8723","documentHash":"4e3b185a-8e56-4c89-b7ea-a9b8d334f566"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"03F14E2076FEABB44CC7B743F6FD9B59C0B3CE3F788CFE10E84226C037F019164ED6EE4E61A04DD072E5640611915200DC9689ED62B57A29F869C4D59C6D63FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-0985","documentHash":"002defbf-325a-404d-a301-7cc974eec233"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Dyderski","uuid":"BA6020477E5CC315EB2E63B48E152FE36A33E8B3703BEC4812CECBFB0E0E652860C4E0E44BFA87F2AF6998A9580D130FEA7048AFDF4D7E950BC02A1F7F9A3632","orcidId":"0000-0003-4453-2781","documentHash":"6a027753-5078-4ffd-bbdc-95bb2c2a4c00"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"64f833de4097076d8859f8c7","doi":"10.1002/ldr.4902","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ldr.4902","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A Meta‐analysis of the effects of ground‐based extraction technologies on fine roots in forest soils","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fine roots are an important component of forest soil as they play a key role in fundamental processes like plant nutrition and water supply. As with all the features of forest soil, the compaction related to the forest operations and, in particular, to the wood extraction via ground-based technologies could lead to a significant impact on the presence of fine roots in the soil affected by the passage of the machines. Considering the lack of a review, we used a meta-analytic approach to synthesise effect sizes of ground-based extraction technologies affecting the presence of fine roots in the soil, using a multivariate mixed-effects meta-analytic model. The obtained results revealed that the presence of fine roots in the soil affected by the passage of the machines was significantly reduced by both skidding (g = \u00011.23, 95%CI -1.87, \u00010.60)\nand forwarding (g = \u00011.37, 95%CI -2.01, \u00010.74). Due to the higher soil compaction caused by forwarding, this method had a marginally but statistically significant greater impact than skidding. We further confirmed the hypothesis that soil compaction and the presence of fine roots were strongly correlated, with the latter being greatly reduced in compacted soils characterised by higher bulk density. What is more, even more than 20 years after a harvesting intervention, the presence of fine roots was significantly lower in both strip roads (forwarding) and skid trails (skidding) as compared\nto areas which were not impacted by the machine passage. This shows that fine roots are particularly vulnerable to forest operations. On the other hand, the majority of the trails in the database used for the meta-analysis were created in countries that favour the creation of a small number of widely used trails. Therefore, it would be scientifically valuable to do a comparative evaluation in various forestry"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","5e709499878c28a0473c026c","62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"35","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"9 - 21","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c796a8752340480571c999","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e709499878c28a0473c026c","5ffebd42085dcb0e357dcd28","64f833de4097076d8859f8cc","64f833de4097076d8859f8cd","64f833de4097076d8859f8ce","64f833de4097076d8859f8cf","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c79","mniswId":"13433","title":"LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT","issn":"1085-3278","eissn":"1099-145X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"b478c5ac-32c9-442c-b503-c986d41e9fb4"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["forwarding","reduced-impact logging","skidding","soil compaction","sustainable forest management","sustainable forest operations"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058825903"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65aba0004097071977565c50","name":"Daniel S.","lastName":"Maynard","documentHash":"488bdf24-5346-4e59-84c9-c92c3c84fecd"},{"objectId":"65aba0004097071977565c4f","name":"Irie C.","lastName":"Zo-Bi","documentHash":"e0cd5606-d61f-4367-88f1-a17ecd8bb87e"},{"objectId":"65aba0004097071977565c4e","name":"Zhi-Xin","lastName":"Zhu","documentHash":"383cf0a0-9a4c-42be-a214-d29c952e929d"},{"objectId":"65aba0004097071977565c4d","name":"Mo","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"0e461053-f1ec-49d0-aa35-be4dbfcfac83"},{"objectId":"65aba0004097071977565c4c","name":"Xiuhai","lastName":"Zhao","documentHash":"305cb4d0-1aab-4e98-a9e3-9c5f56a783ba"},{"objectId":"65aba0004097071977565c4b","name":"Chunyu","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"29ba1b94-8cb8-4e61-b8d5-5aa8c4b2f224"},{"objectId":"65aba0004097071977565c4a","name":"Roderik","lastName":"Zagt","documentHash":"1fc444b9-e38a-400b-a2a1-8b03f0cad580"},{"objectId":"65aba0004097071977565c49","name":"Verginia","lastName":"Wortel","documentHash":"315f3ef7-6e9d-46fc-a61d-85022e5ecad8"},{"objectId":"65aba0004097071977565c48","name":"Hannsjoerg","lastName":"Woell","documentHash":"0055d270-ffef-4f40-9336-4fc70f3820c1"},{"objectId":"65aba0004097071977565c47","name":"Florian","lastName":"Wittmann","documentHash":"724361b7-8090-4fe5-9486-9265ac587c89"},{"objectId":"65aba0004097071977565c46","name":"Susan K.","lastName":"Wiser","documentHash":"553a91cd-b4a9-480a-84ec-634ffe8fb535"},{"objectId":"65aba0004097071977565c45","name":"Gijsbert D.

Tree invasions in particular have been relatively overlooked, even though they have the potential to transform ecosystems and economies3,4. Here, leveraging global tree databases5–7, we explore how the phylogenetic and functional diversity of native tree communities, human pressure and the environment infuence the establishment of non-native tree species and the subsequent invasion severity. We fnd that anthropogenic factors are key to predicting whether a location is invaded, but that invasion severity is underpinned by native diversity, with higher diversity predicting lower invasion severity. Temperature and precipitation emerge as strong predictors of invasion strategy, with non-native species invading successfully when they are similar to the native community in cold or dry extremes. Yet, despite the infuence of these ecological forces in determining invasion strategy, we fnd evidence that these patterns can be obscured by human activity, with lower ecological signal in areas with higher proximity to shipping ports. Our global perspective of non-native tree invasion highlights that human drivers infuence non-native tree presence, and that native phylogenetic and functional diversity have a critical role in the establishment and spread of subsequent invasions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział

range shifts of alien tree species in Europe","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Alien tree species are considered both a threat to nature conservation and a base for forest management. We compiled species occurrences from biodiversity databases, forest inventories, and literature data. We modeled the availability of potential niches using the MaxEnt method and bioclimatic variables for current conditions, 2041–2060, and 2061–2080 periods. We used four climate scenarios: SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP485. The results confirm our hypotheses that, (i) coniferous species will contract, and deciduous trees will expand their climatic niche, (ii) a significant part of the areas where the studied species currently occur will be outside their climatic optimum in the coming decades; (iii) changes in the climatic optimum distribution will be greater in the 2041–2060 period than in 2061–2080. These predicted shifts are relevant for evidence-based management in sites already occupied by the studied alien trees. Our results are also relevant to the development of prevention and early detection measures in areas predicted to become climatically suitable for the studied species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","uid":"bk6a4u9UDD_o3fTovGAeczg","uuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","name":"Instytut Badawczy Leśnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afd7f","64acbea840e3ff295b969870"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","parentUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","rootUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","5e709442878c28a0473b9148"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"341","pagesFromTo":"109650","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64f9ca4140970774bae338a6","5e709442878c28a0473b9148","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","64f9ca4140970774bae338a9","64f9ca4140970774bae338aa","5e7093b9878c28a0473afd7f","64f9ca4140970774bae338ab","64acbea840e3ff295b969870","64f9ca4140970774bae338ac","64f9ca4140970774bae338ad","64f9ca4140970774bae338ae","64f9ca4140970774bae338af","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476f1b","mniswId":"663","title":"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","issn":"0168-1923","eissn":"1873-2240","documentHash":"18eac4a2-72e6-41ac-9bc3-58b877f17146"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64f9ca4140970774bae338a5","year":"2023","volume":"341","documentHash":"64f867c9-e8fe-442e-a7c0-900b80b5775d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["MaxEnt","Introduced species","SSPs scenarios","Conifers","Deciduous trees"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058885013"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"653f9bcf4097076bc16f7d8a","name":"Giorgi","lastName":"Kvartskhava","documentHash":"4a0db24d-e0e5-4fd2-a0d0-80c25040315a"},{"objectId":"653f9bcf4097076bc16f7d89","name":"Vahid","lastName":"Farzaliyev","documentHash":"074c0708-0102-4366-a701-f161b2abd7af"},{"objectId":"653f9bcf4097076bc16f7d88","name":"Irina","lastName":"Danelia","documentHash":"69b556c3-6336-4577-b507-8f05de8f9c06"},{"objectId":"609badcb9543c73526c48ddc","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Walas","uuid":"E1487E209BFE1859BC19AE81536E570F7441462D7640828646C2A178167548E2FAB950B628D6E3175BF4B9F287E730921BE7B613AC07554C874A38EDD7300CA8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4060-9801","documentHash":"3b7fa0ae-0321-4b2a-ad87-b43027d64501"},{"objectId":"602ba52c9543c7410626df33","name":"Berika","lastName":"Beridze","uuid":"CBB070E6C9724DA2FD6A57D597848764D75868EC459DBA9A19D4827C8B29F81A270EB6F72EEF1B79E5E4D425A11CAE55BD3041C0466F009E8D18709367238EC5","documentHash":"d03c5e57-0bed-4ea4-a51f-b67526cb9dc7"},{"objectId":"5e709474878c28a0473bd690","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Sękiewicz","uuid":"F47D23143D7DF955D2BB2D786A62728A247F606882D2B16A1FFAE8DEF95FD041AA1D0E143C9468EB0B0BED7EEC7992DC133AD6BC49B7D81081A5E6E4990372F6","orcidId":"0000-0002-1830-0816","documentHash":"e9dd267e-071d-4ba2-9673-4e851c72944c"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a34","name":"Monika","lastName":"Dering","uuid":"830A9A3A04A3C0BC144ED7ED7DE49765B0DB966DEECF4D801244F239B5BA34C475410A4C11736035F4922A6ACEEC03B816FCF7F4485DBB9B66E92A89EF1EAAF7","orcidId":"0000-0001-7017-5541","documentHash":"7f413848-d004-4d2f-9e57-190820ee47e1"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a647f","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Szmyt","uuid":"B86E6A85DE8BB2E3C8837A803BB39936C544408AF80918648FD8D1BCD3A1D74C646B1DFB438AC8FCA65CB6A7CF22F1A98B9CFF1BE7031F669DAA47AE50BBE49E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1185-6993","documentHash":"10f9163d-fcfa-4445-acda-7771c8bdc59e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"653f9bcf4097076bc16f7d85","doi":"10.12657/denbio.090.005","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.12657/denbio.090.005","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Niche modelling suggests low feasibility of assisted gene flow for a Neogene relict tree, Castanea sativa Mill.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"As many tree species populations are being degraded by climate change, adaptive conservation, and forest management, such as assisted gene flow (AGF), can provide the genetic variation needed to adapt to climate change. The core of this strategy is to assist the adaptation process in populations at risk of climate maladaptation by introducing individuals with beneficial alleles to cope with expected climate changes. Castanea sativa Mill. (sweet chestnut) is an essential component of natural forests in the Medi­terranean and Caucasian regions, with a long history of cultivation. Current climate change may seriously threaten the long-term persistence of the species, particularly in the Caucasus region, where the largest range reductions are predicted. Here, we used Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to assess the feasi­bility of AGF in European and Caucasian populations of Castanea sativa. Bioclimatic variables for present (1981–2010) and future (2071–2100) conditions were obtained from the CHELSA climate database. The final models of future species ranges were averaged across three climate models (IPSL-CM6A-LR, MPI-ESM1-2-HR and UKESM1-0-L) and three climate change scenarios – SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. There are marked differences in the climatic niches of the Iberian, Alpine-Apennine, Balkan, and Caucasian populations, with significant implications for AGF. The most suitable European areas for the Caucasian populations were found only in the Adriatic region. The Iberian populations were not compatible with the predicted future climate in the Caucasus in any of the scenarios tested. Suitable areas for Alpine-Apennine populations within the AGF strategy were predicted in the Colchic lowlands, the eastern Pontic mountains and the Hyrcanian forests in the SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 climate change scenarios. In contrast, the Balkan populations would be compatible at most with the western Pontic mountains and, to a lesser extent, with the Hyrcanian forests. According to the most damaging climate scenario SSP5-8.5, the potential of AGF in the Caucasus with Alpine-Apennine and Balkan populations could be very limited. Our study showed limited applicability of AGF for Castanea sativa between the European and Caucasian populations due to low climate match. Genomic modelling is needed to fully assess the feasibility of this strategy in the species"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a647f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602ba52c9543c7410626df33","609badcb9543c73526c48ddc","5e709474878c28a0473bd690"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"90","pagesFromTo":"58-75","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602ba52c9543c7410626df33","5e709474878c28a0473bd690","609badcb9543c73526c48ddc","653f9bcf4097076bc16f7d88","653f9bcf4097076bc16f7d89","653f9bcf4097076bc16f7d8a","5e709347878c28a0473a647f","5e709410878c28a0473b5a34"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547790b","mniswId":"4926","title":"Dendrobiology","issn":"1641-1307","eissn":"2083-8387","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"ce7d89a5-6164-4916-a543-a236ef8ec26b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"653f9bcf4097076bc16f7d86","year":"2023","volume":"90","documentHash":"bf0e3d3d-ef5d-4647-b199-aca983fd481a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["climate change","Caucasus","sweet chestnut","range modelling","maladaptation","adaptive manage-ment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058954058"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"653f8b2a4097076bc16c284c","name":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Picchio","documentHash":"f09f252b-c59c-499a-a2f9-39e1044e621c"},{"objectId":"653f8b2a4097076bc16c284b","name":"Rachele","lastName":"Venanzi","documentHash":"cf6a0c7b-84b5-4ed7-b9e5-64bcb27680da"},{"objectId":"653f8b2a4097076bc16c284a","name":"Raffaele","lastName":"Spinelli","documentHash":"f2d5695d-0cfc-4b7b-b285-8fa9c5bb9df6"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c999","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Latterini","uuid":"CACEB340446FB4D6658D01649C4614E61499A61641F167AFFBC6344D44E8291B61B43C50E527B5275449413154134E7EACD6FF854AACC44F14ACA9A37487CF08","orcidId":"0000-0001-7401-8754","documentHash":"7c970a18-8b3d-4160-8189-e32a1aab4e44"}],"objectId":"653f8b2a4097076bc16c2847","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121514","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S037811272300748X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Acorn Review: Focus on ground-based extraction systems: Is skidding really more impactful than forwarding?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The disturbance that ground-based extraction operations can imply on the forests ecosystem is an issue which demands more attention. Skidding and forwarding are the two most common ground-based extraction systems. While skidding implies to partially or fully dragging the logs on the ground, in forwarding, timber is transported on a deck thus avoiding direct contact with the soil. Generally, skidding is considered to be more impactful than forwarding in relation to the amount of disturbance on forest soil and residual stand. However, the framework depicted in current literature is not so strict. While skidding actually implies a higher level of damage to residual stand, the situation concerning disturbance to forest soil is much more complex. The dissimilarities in the results from various studies on this topic have shown the level of complexity. The lack of research investigating the consequences of the two extraction systems on the overall forest ecosystem is evident. Only a few studies were focused for example on the implications on biodiversity. However, the beneficial effects of best management practices, such as the application of snatch blocks during winching or positioning brush mats on the skid trails/ strip roads to reduce soil compaction, have been clearly demonstrated."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"551","pagesFromTo":"121514","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c796a8752340480571c999","653f8b2a4097076bc16c284a","653f8b2a4097076bc16c284b","653f8b2a4097076bc16c284c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d2e","mniswId":"6734","title":"FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","issn":"0378-1127","documentHash":"37771705-8204-4376-a5d9-e8d43ad82b3e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"653f8b2a4097076bc16c2848","year":"2024","volume":"551","documentHash":"6afd3c60-51e7-4595-a425-317fcabebe2b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sustainable forest management,","Sustainable forest operations,","Reduced-impact logging,","Forest soil,","Skidder,","Forwarder,","Forestry-fitted farm tractor,","Best management practices"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058970577"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6627d8f74097072ea08ffc77","name":"  Irina ","lastName":"Danelia,","documentHash":"f3746970-c501-40cc-a234-dc2c57ace975"},{"objectId":"65576f9d4097077c6793de25","name":"Angela A","lastName":"Bruch","documentHash":"f107aea5-85bd-4a0f-a3ea-3dbd7227358b"},{"objectId":"65576f9d4097077c6793de24","name":"Vahid","lastName":"Farzaliyev","documentHash":"d465a05a-8b01-413c-8cae-173259043938"},{"objectId":"65576f9d4097077c6793de23","name":"Giorgi","lastName":"Kvartskhava","documentHash":"770ffc17-2f3a-403a-b7d3-3790b8075bd2"},{"objectId":"65576f9d4097077c6793de22","name":"Peter A","lastName":"Thomas","documentHash":"eb4ea7db-9d92-4a7c-8895-fc0adc3c045f"},{"objectId":"65576f9d4097077c6793de1f","name":"Berika","lastName":"Beridze","documentHash":"9ee48bd9-f89d-43fa-9604-1e6d2e7856d4"},{"objectId":"609badcb9543c73526c48ddc","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Walas","uuid":"E1487E209BFE1859BC19AE81536E570F7441462D7640828646C2A178167548E2FAB950B628D6E3175BF4B9F287E730921BE7B613AC07554C874A38EDD7300CA8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4060-9801","documentHash":"3b7fa0ae-0321-4b2a-ad87-b43027d64501"},{"objectId":"5e709474878c28a0473bd690","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Sękiewicz","uuid":"F47D23143D7DF955D2BB2D786A62728A247F606882D2B16A1FFAE8DEF95FD041AA1D0E143C9468EB0B0BED7EEC7992DC133AD6BC49B7D81081A5E6E4990372F6","orcidId":"0000-0002-1830-0816","documentHash":"e9dd267e-071d-4ba2-9673-4e851c72944c"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a34","name":"Monika","lastName":"Dering","uuid":"830A9A3A04A3C0BC144ED7ED7DE49765B0DB966DEECF4D801244F239B5BA34C475410A4C11736035F4922A6ACEEC03B816FCF7F4485DBB9B66E92A89EF1EAAF7","orcidId":"0000-0001-7017-5541","documentHash":"7f413848-d004-4d2f-9e57-190820ee47e1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65576f9d4097077c6793de1d","doi":"10.1093/aobpla/plad059","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plad059","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Evolutionary history of Castanea sativa in the Caucasus driven by Middle and Late Pleistocene paleoenvironmental changes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Due to global climate cooling and aridification since the Paleogene, members of the Neogene flora were extirpated from the Northern Hemisphere or were confined to a few refugial areas. For some species, the final reduction/extinction came in the Pleistocene, but some others have survived climatic transformations up to the present. This has occurred in Castanea sativa, a species of high commercial value in Europe and a significant component of the Caucasian forests’ biodiversity. In contrast to the European range, neither the historical biogeography nor the population genetic structure of the species in its isolated Caucasian range has been clarified. Here, based on a survey of 21 natural populations from the Caucasus and a single one from Europe, we provide a likely biogeographic reconstruction and genetic diversity details. By applying Bayesian inference, species distribution modelling and fossil pollen data, we estimated (i) the time of the Caucasian—European divergence during the Middle Pleistocene, (ii) the time of divergence among Caucasian lineages and (iii) outlined the glacial refugia for species. The climate changes related to the Early–Middle Pleistocene Transition are proposed as the major drivers of the intraspecific divergence and European–Caucasian disjunction for the species, while the impact of the last glacial cycle was of marginal importance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii

spring geophytes are very sensitive to climate change, responding by shifting flowering and fruiting dates. However, there is a gap in knowledge about climatic drivers of their distributions and range shifts under climate change. Here we aimed to estimate climate niche shifts for four widely distributed and common geophytes of the nemoral zone of Europe (Anemone nemorosa, Anemone ranunculoides, Convallaria majalis and Maianthemum bifolium) and to assess the threat level under various climate change scenarios. Using MaxEnt species distribution models and future climate change scenarios we found that the precipitation of the warmest quarter was the most important factor shaping their ranges. All species studied will experience more loss in the 2061–2080 period than in 2041–2060, and under more pessimistic scenarios. M. bifolium will experience the highest loss, followed by A. nemorosa, A. ranunculoides, and the smallest for C. majalis. A. ranunculoides will gain the most, while M. bifolium will have the smallest potential range expansion. Studied species may respond differently to climate change despite similar current distributions and climatic variables affecting their potential distribution. Even slight differences in climatic niches could reduce the overlap of future ranges compared to present. We expect that due to high dependence on the warmest quarter precipitation, summer droughts in the future may be particularly severe for species that prefer moist soils. The lack of adaptation to long-distance migration and limited availability of appropriate soils may limit their migration and lead to a decline in biodiversity and changes in European forests."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709368878c28a0473a8f58"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","uid":"bk6a4u9UDD_o3fTovGAeczg","uuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","name":"Instytut Badawczy Leśnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afd7f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","parentUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","rootUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092cd878c28a04739d15f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e709442878c28a0473b9148"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"905","pagesFromTo":"167303","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["651be46b40970732bea9732e","5e709442878c28a0473b9148","5e7092cd878c28a04739d15f","5e709368878c28a0473a8f58","651be46b40970732bea97331","651be46b40970732bea97332","5e7093b9878c28a0473afd7f","651be46b40970732bea97334","651be46b40970732bea97335","651be46b40970732bea97336","651be46b40970732bea97337","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","issn":"0048-9697","documentHash":"536a2e2c-aae7-4edb-84d0-5d817a2d0285"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"651a6ce940970723639cf50a","year":"2023","volume":"905","documentHash":"575c7f25-6fb6-419c-aa7c-c4e1e4f603e6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Climate change","Forest understorey","Herbaceous plants"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059008259"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"652ac617409707678e326c50","name":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Picchio","documentHash":"74b7574b-f6a7-44b0-a51b-60cb9915b4f8"},{"objectId":"652ac617409707678e326c4e","name":"Beatrice","lastName":"Bassotti","documentHash":"2938dcec-b59e-4a04-9a33-d721cff09a31"},{"objectId":"652ac617409707678e326c4d","name":"Giulio","lastName":"Sperandio","documentHash":"56b2d044-6046-4463-83ff-282a2a9b2a0c"},{"objectId":"652ac617409707678e326c4c","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Acampora","documentHash":"5b3ffd11-9e59-402e-a7e4-5d0427c0dc56"},{"objectId":"652ac617409707678e326c4b","name":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Civitarese","documentHash":"aff0a8b3-393d-4d29-a905-937fcc908b1e"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c999","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Latterini","uuid":"CACEB340446FB4D6658D01649C4614E61499A61641F167AFFBC6344D44E8291B61B43C50E527B5275449413154134E7EACD6FF854AACC44F14ACA9A37487CF08","orcidId":"0000-0001-7401-8754","documentHash":"7c970a18-8b3d-4160-8189-e32a1aab4e44"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"652ac617409707678e326c49","doi":"10.3390/f14102025","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/14/10/2025/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A Comparison of the Qualitative Characteristics of Pellets Made from Different Types of Raw Materials","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"With the aim of extending the production of renewable energy from lignocellulosic materialsby improving their energy characteristics, the authors have started a series of experimental activitiesthat involve a densiﬁcation process of the wood material and a subsequent quantitative and qualitativecharacterization of the different pellets produced.

Among the 15 parameters that were investigated, 9 (length,diameter, fusibility, As, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn) were within the limits set by current legislation for allthe analyzed pellets. The same was not detected for the remaining 6 parameters (bulk density, heatingvalue, ash, N, durability, and cadmium), the value of which did not reach the quality requirementsestablished by the standards. The biomass obtained from medium rotation forestry plants (MRF) andforest residues turned out to be the best source of material to be used to produce pellets.

Introducing exotic    species, and   interbreeding between species can   lead   to  processes that   in  the   case   of  rare   species or  small    populations threatens their    integrity. Given    the declining trends     of  many    populations due   to  increased hybridization, early    recognition of  hybrids becomes important in  conservation management. Natural hybridization is prevalent in Jacobaea. There    are   many    naturally occurring interspecific hybrids in  this genus,     including those    between Jacobaea vulgaris and   its  relatives. AlthoughJacobaea erucifolia and J. vulgarisoften    co-  occur    and   are   considered closely related, apart    from the   few   reports of  German botanists on   the   existence of  such    hybrids, there    is  no information on  research confirming hybridization between them.    Morphologically in -termediate individuals, found    in  the   sympatric distributions of J. vulgaris and J. eruci-folia,    were    hypothesized to  be  their    hybrids. Two   molecular marker systems (nuclear and   chloroplast DNA    markers) were    employed to  test   this   hypothesis and   characterize putative hybrids. Nuclear and   chloroplast DNA    sequencing results and   taxon-    specific amplified fragment length     polymorphism (AFLP) fragment distribution analysis con -firmed     the   hybrid     nature     of  all  25  putative hybrids. The   AFLP    patterns of  most    hybrids demonstrated a  closer    relationship to J. erucifolia, suggesting frequent backcrossing.Moreover, they    showed that   several individuals previously described as  pure    were probably also   of  hybrid origin,     backcrosses to J. erucifolia  and  J. vulgaris.  This   study provides the   first   molecular confirmation that   natural hybrids between J. vulgaris and J. erucifolia occur in  Poland. Hybridization appeared to  be  bidirectional but   asymmetri-cal with J. vulgaris as the usual maternal parent."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f77e408085dcb410a25e893","5e709347878c28a0473a64c2","5e709261878c28a047394a74","5e709349878c28a0473a68a4","5e709344878c28a0473a61fe"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709261878c28a047394a74"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"10467","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709349878c28a0473a68a4","5e709261878c28a047394a74","6537b942409707399ef3dbed","5e709344878c28a0473a61fe","5e709347878c28a0473a64c2","5f77e408085dcb410a25e893"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779fd","mniswId":"5330","title":"Ecology and Evolution","issn":"2045-7758","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"a6b248e0-1745-48f2-a68e-8649d2c3d9b3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"653249d740970712f7cafe7b","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"9","documentHash":"bce239d0-7433-4120-9554-8f5d4a1aa398"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["admixture","amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)","cpDNA","hybridization","Jacobaea erucifolia","Jacobaea vulgaris"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059046768"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5ffebd42085dcb0e357dcd28","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Rawlik","uuid":"650EDCAF2566F3DE1BDC37442DBC9D74B15FD23887DB7ED9EFE77D05491E679A821EF507C11DB1262954B13D6343B9A5F3574D11A868F347318E7F2D4360FB8D","orcidId":"0000-0003-4177-7396","documentHash":"dbc9cf78-2bde-47af-a3ff-184635d49a17"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c0292","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Rawlik","uuid":"5B067CAC8B2137636BF0E8B3947C5C57027EA81145E05205FE8D29AEFD057470A4D64B60C50D62B7C14008EE23EE7DFA4111592AD0B2F9C87A90A2465CB4853B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7299-8437","documentHash":"ef5c421d-e45d-464d-b954-b2f3c7c9734a"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"03F14E2076FEABB44CC7B743F6FD9B59C0B3CE3F788CFE10E84226C037F019164ED6EE4E61A04DD072E5640611915200DC9689ED62B57A29F869C4D59C6D63FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-0985","documentHash":"002defbf-325a-404d-a301-7cc974eec233"}],"objectId":"656da98640970718551c47b8","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121195","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Seasonal dynamics of herbaceous layer biomass and its contribution to annual net primary production in an oak–hornbeam forest","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","uid":"bPE2PjbeOl7yC2KHqaQECkQ","uuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","name":"Uniwersytet im.

However, it can also induce physiological disturbances. In contrast to BAP, the addition of silicon to the medium has been carried out to improve the characteristics related to growth and physiology during in vitro culture. We aimed to assess the morphophysiological modulations in Quercus robur shoots exposed to BAP and calcium silicate (CaSiO3), used alone or synergistically, during in vitro multiplication. Shoots were cultured with BAP at 0 or 3.50 μM combined with CaSiO3 concentrations at 0, 6, 12, or 18 μM. The morphophysiological traits and photosynthetic apparatus functioning were quantified at 46 days of growth. De novo shoot regeneration was verified only in explants cultured under BAP exposure. Shoots cultured with CaSiO3 supplementation and BAP-free media had the largest leaf area, which was a response to larger epidermal cells. Additionally, thicker tissues (adaxial epidermis, palisade, and spongy parenchyma) were observed in leaves that grew under CaSiO3. BAP supplementation induced shoots with a ∼18% reduction of the contents of chlorophyll and phenolic compounds. BAP also induced harmful effects on the photosynthetic apparatus, reducing 8% of the fraction of oxygen-evolving complex (OEC centers) and 33% of active reaction centers (RC/CSm). Such results were attenuated when the shoots were co-exposed to CaSiO3. The positive effects of CaSiO3 were confirmed by the ≥ 42% increase in the total performance index (PI(TOTAL)). The addition in the concentration range between 12 and 18 μM CaSiO3 can mitigate the harmful effects of BAP during the in vitro multiplication phase of Q. robur."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["648d1aa940e3ff055afbad3c","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8fc","5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f","61ce79387523401fc10e7c26","5e7093b1878c28a0473af520"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"194","pagesFromTo":"116377","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["648d1aa940e3ff055afbad3c","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8fc","5e7093b1878c28a0473af520","61ce79387523401fc10e7c26","656daa4f40970718551c51b8","5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780a6","mniswId":"8251","title":"Industrial Crops and Products","issn":"0926-6690","eissn":"0926-6690","documentHash":"d6fc1395-6854-49a3-a8b6-440ec66188ee"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656daa4f40970718551c51b7","year":"2023","volume":"194","documentHash":"f86358c6-83a4-426e-8ef7-18828600646a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Chlorophyll a fluorescence","Morphophysiological disturbances","Plant anatomy","Plant growth regulator","Silicon"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059062508"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656da7f540970718551c04af","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Modrzyński","documentHash":"f522d09e-49c0-43fa-9ea6-88ef423313aa"},{"objectId":"5e70925f878c28a0473948ba","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Chmura","uuid":"45584806025AB5676212F51067269F57169E4509E713AC44E88B63C8EAC9B0467B5C8D2C3B6C55AEA121E1B58BF67DCC8E2FE44B80DC7DA86DA1194442EC4219","orcidId":"0000-0002-8776-1472","documentHash":"ce949223-4359-4845-9a10-f225d9b9486b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"656da7f540970718551c04ad","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121118","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0378112723003523?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Sensitivity of height growth response to climate change does not vary with age in common garden among Norway spruce populations from elevational gradients","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tree populations are typically adapted to their local environments, and this adaptive ability is crucial for the\nmaintenance of resilient forest ecosystems.

However, contrary to our expectation, the slopes of height growth\nrate vs. climatic transfer did not vary among the four analyzed time periods, implying that populations did not\nshow an increasing maladaptation to climate change with age. Our results indicate that existing spruce populations from both examined mountain ranges are likely to show a decreasing productivity with warming and\ndrying climate.

Therefore, environmental and\nanthropogenic factors affect the assembly of urban wildlife in plant communities. For biodiversity conservation and eco-\nsystem services in urban areas, it is crucial to understand the impacts of urbanization as well as the introduction of alien\nplant species on urban plant communities. On 47 sites in Poznań (W Poland), we studied variation within and between three\nmanagement greenery habitats, i.e., urban parks, greenery associated with housing estates, and urban grasslands, as they\nrelate to taxonomical, functional, and phylogenetic alpha and beta diversity. We also examined how urbanization (measured\nby ISA) and alien plant species relate to vegetation compositional differences. We found that both urbanization and alien\nplant species cover decreased alpha diversity, while urbanization had various impacts on beta diversity within each studied\nhabitat. Our results suggest that human pressure leads to similarities in the urban flora, where plant species with specific\nfunctional traits adapted to the urban environment. To achieve sustainable urbanization, urban planners should not only\ncreate diverse green spaces but also eliminate alien plants, increasing the role of urban land management in promoting the\nwildness of plant biodiversity in cities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709344878c28a0473a6214","5e7092cd878c28a04739d15f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"40","pagesFromTo":"92390-92403","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092cd878c28a04739d15f","5e709344878c28a0473a6214","655cb3074097071dcb5be62f","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b16","mniswId":"5845","title":"Environmental Science and Pollution Research","issn":"0944-1344","eissn":"1614-7499","documentHash":"a276ab08-d4e3-4e6f-8f21-94c32ed97f96"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655cb3074097071dcb5be62d","year":"2023","volume":"30","number":"40","documentHash":"e2dbf15f-81aa-4e3f-93e1-02e98b5b8d6b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Urban biotic homogenization","Urbanization","Vegetation","Urban greenery","Alpha diversity","Beta diversity","Human pressure","Alien plant species"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059118814"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656da8c840970718551c385c","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Banach","documentHash":"0e587f96-9e12-4f7d-908a-0b2cb6505413"},{"objectId":"5f6abb85752340073806aa4c","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kujawska","uuid":"F6645955D7F4E7662DB022506F2C0503DB5E68C6EFF8C7D0B97E973205302BDAF7D3842A20D1D3AF901AEF524EC116E50A9ACE0811BBDEE7CC951D65D41AB069","documentHash":"3f65a79e-8a19-4af5-bb9c-9c2ced245dae"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2bfd","name":"Robin","lastName":"Wilgan","uuid":"29076990142B96970CB8B1C129870023B5EAB112BBB9BF28CCF94114C76E5469B812B686E4CB17C8E2B4C86F55F65FDCDA30C9117E95C27FAC26F94FCAE1FC15","orcidId":"0000-0002-3628-5226","documentHash":"a7a6a49e-60fe-4c3e-b25a-d1c90bfed8a7"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a0473949fc","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Leski","uuid":"499B23F9100DF850755C238F9A97C7142B3BA38F5DDDFB0931102B9E1746E46A470F7665C5CA3E4BD70FD941A00BEF3E5864BF947DB02FA5EE70CB8B7506A0B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-4167-5015","documentHash":"0d2af209-8514-4188-bc47-8bacbc29178c"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393fd1","name":"Maria","lastName":"Rudawska","uuid":"2623C772C9DC8C0162E05A0A0D1D53D24AFBD6AA0C48BDFFBD352450BC7AF58795228ABFCF607A79693ADFAED93251D11313D1764846D587AFE3357D4B0E9B45","orcidId":"0000-0002-8103-5269","documentHash":"07b3898f-cdcb-41c6-970f-3ca34d4bfe95"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"656da8c840970718551c385b","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121355","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0378112723005893?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Comparable ectomycorrhizal fungal species richness but low species similarity among native Abies alba and alien Abies grandis from provenance trials in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Our study contributes to the understanding of the diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungal (ECMF) communities of\nnative A. alba and alien A. grandis in provenance trials situated in lowland and montane regions in Poland\n(Central Europe).

We found that the studied fir species had relatively high and comparable\nECMF species richness (66 and 69 fungal taxa on A. grandis and A. alba, respectively). Twenty-six taxa were\nassociated with both hosts and 83 taxa were found uniquely on one or the other fir species. The ECMF community\ncomposition and structure of A. alba and A. grandis differed substantially both at the species and the phylogenetic\nlineage levels. Soil parameters such as total nitrogen, magnesium and potassium content and C/N ratio appeared\nmoderately but significantly correlated with the ECMF community assembly of both firs. The provenance of the\nhost tree species did not appear to be a strong factor in structuring the ECMF communities. This was found\ndespite the low number of common ECMF species and relatively high number of unique species among the individual provenances of both fir species. The results of the study suggest that locally based specificity in\nhost–fungal communities is likely a contributing factor in the outcome of provenance trials. We posit that much\ninsight into the role of tree provenances in shaping ECMF communities will be gained by further exploring this\narea of research. On the surveyed experimental forest sites of A. alba and A. grandis, fungal species of conservation concern – particularly those that were endangered and rare – have been reported.

Resolving the classification issue of these bigleaf poplars is now even more necessary because they are known not only from cultivation, but recent evidence confirms their spontaneous occurrence in Hubei Province, China (Zhang, unpublished information). The two species were first artificially crossed in 1956 in Poland and again independently in 1974 in Sweden. Initially, this taxon was described as P. ×wilsocarpa (Bartkowiak & Bugała, 1978). However, this name was invalid due to the lack of Latin diagnosis (which was required at that time) and lack of type designation. In 1996, Böcker and Koltzenburg proposed the name P. ×kornicensis for this hybrid, but it too was invalid for similar reasons and lack of description. In our work, we revisited these poplars and validated the name proposed by Böcker and Koltzenburg by providing a description and type designation. Considering the overall appearance of these hybrid poplars (silhouette, branching pattern), they bear a closer resemblance to P. wilsonii. Other analyzed morphological features are mostly intermediate compared to the parent species, but overall, they lean slightly more towards P. lasiocarpa. We highlight the main diagnostic characteristics that distinguish these species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709261878c28a047394a74"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"90","pagesFromTo":"86-94","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659411ac40970739462f1d94","5e709261878c28a047394a74"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547790b","mniswId":"4926","title":"Dendrobiology","issn":"1641-1307","eissn":"2083-8387","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"ce7d89a5-6164-4916-a543-a236ef8ec26b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"653f9bcf4097076bc16f7d86","year":"2023","volume":"90","documentHash":"bf0e3d3d-ef5d-4647-b199-aca983fd481a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Leucoides","allopatric hybridization","Kórnik arboretum","poplar","typification"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059207738"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6594126b40970739462f2647","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Zieliński","documentHash":"4e2b6c23-7d6d-4713-840e-7cad1a84f929"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394a74","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kosiński","uuid":"78590F765F6D627BFA23540A89C152ABCD7990144B97432F8F57D15440AA9EC8BDFD44F2AFAB5BD8FC92155F12FECC06AFB846260B583E16C850E0562642344A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6104-4267","documentHash":"8e1251cd-7a1d-4cca-b13b-95eaf34a1fa7"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394a3f","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Tomaszewski","uuid":"46B038A751C67B0DFCEAD7C9B5AD9F737AEDE897AB6804F9124BCA6AA6A5830E6203D7B38CF8DFA4F8F9289D3A7A6101E83B3CA02544C1B570E8FD0D481FDA6B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7768-5747","documentHash":"c7305c1b-26a6-41de-8e8e-f7dd3a3be538"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6594126b40970739462f2644","doi":"10.12657/denbio.089.008","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.12657/denbio.089.008","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Salix ×browiczii (Salicaceae) – a new nothospecies from northeastern Greece","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A hybrid between Salix triandra and S. xanthicola, occurring in the Rhodope Mountains in north­eastern Greece, is described as a new nothospecies.

The effects of increased proline levels in response to drought differ among species. Trees are exposed to the long-term effects of climate change. The reproductive success of species in a specific environment depends on the functional trait of tree seeds. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of drought stress on the proline concentrations in seedling leaf tissues of woody plant species and their relationships to drought duration, seed mass, seed category and coniferous/deciduous classification. Drought duration exhibited a nonlinear effect on proline accumulations. The drought effect on proline accumulations is greater for deciduous than for coniferous species and is higher for orthodox seed species than for recalcitrant. The seedlings of large-seeded species showed greater effect sizes than those of small-seeded species. Our results suggest that there is an optimum level at which proline accumulations under the influence of drought are the highest. A link between seed functional traits, as well as the coniferous/deciduous classification, and proline concentrations in tree seedlings during water stress were determined for the first time.

The ongoing climate crisis induces tree decline in many regions, compromising the mitigation potential of forests. Scientific-based strategies for prioritizing forest tree populations are critical to managing the impact of climate change. Identifying future climate refugia, which are locations naturally buffering the negative impact of climate change, may facilitate local conservation. In this work, we conducted the populations' prioritization for Castanea sativa (sweet chestnut), a Neogene relict growing in the Caucasus global biodiversity hotspot. We generated genetic and ecological metrics for 21 sites in Georgia and Azerbaijan, which cover the natural range of sweet chestnut across the region. We demonstrated that climate primarily drives the pattern of genetic diversity in C. sativa, proved with a significant isolation-by-environment model. In future, climate change may significantly reorganize the species' genetic diversity, inducing even some genetic loss, especially in the very distinct eastern fringe of the species range in Azerbaijan. Based on our combined approach, we mapped populations suitable for ex situ and in situ conservation, accounting for genetic variability and the location of future climate refugia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602ba52c9543c7410626df33","609badcb9543c73526c48ddc","5e709474878c28a0473bd690"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a34"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"e10068","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602ba52c9543c7410626df33","5e709474878c28a0473bd690","609badcb9543c73526c48ddc","65bb74fa4097074fb4d99fd7","65bb74fa4097074fb4d99fd2","65bb74fa4097074fb4d99fd3","65bb74fa4097074fb4d99fd4","65bb74fa4097074fb4d99fd5","5e709410878c28a0473b5a34"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779fd","mniswId":"5330","title":"Ecology and Evolution","issn":"2045-7758","eissn":"2045-7758","documentHash":"934f9485-6fd3-411e-9c6c-db885bb164ae"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biodiversity","conservation genetics","effective population size","landscape genetics","niche modeling","prioritization","sweet chestnut"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059370536"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f6","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Łukowski","uuid":"F39E74CC05397C5CEBACC79F5823CE316F6BD2D7EA35B9C15342035D7CE0A6A2A1AEFF6BBC6092CA65551E8A963A5F38E20AF2495748826D21F3CCC1E134018A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4860-4984","documentHash":"ba7a07cf-dcc2-4e95-bc5c-619b7d658a96"},{"objectId":"5e70925f878c28a0473948eb","name":"Marian","lastName":"Giertych","uuid":"D85A74FC45279BF277CE35CC327DB0BA15FEC69CF45A8601C40DFADE662FAB22D5D07641DC212895E64D42741ACC82BA3784AE6B4B24105DC4C09A96085E1E04","orcidId":"0000-0001-5578-9545","documentHash":"8e1d0c77-5c7f-4cdd-857b-b0989664441f"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393e57","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Karolewski","uuid":"C8C384C558E8EC34804D371779ACBA1DC66FD90CC1AE2B5F1CF6F9287E1DF9AA530170B47B2C5C34506965ACFCE47744EEC1E6B73B33DCD70A1BE3B08F1A0C0D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3064-1274","documentHash":"60c6d540-8249-464e-aa02-b839d6103e09"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66016f854097070f89ebf99a","doi":"10.1007/s10265-023-01462-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10265-023-01462-8.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Cynipid galls on oak leaves are resilient to leaf vein disruption","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Oaks serve as host plants for numerous insects, including those forming galls. Galls induced on oaks are completely dependent on leaf resources. Many other folivores damage veins of leaves, which may result in cutting galls off from sources of assimilates, nutrients and water. We hypothesised that the disruption of the continuity of leaf vascular tissues stops gall development, leading to the death of the larva. Leaves of sessile oak (Quercus petraea) with Cynips quercusfolii galls in the initial stage of development were marked. The diameter of the galls was measured, and the vein on which the gall was present was cut. Four experimental treatments were established: control – with no cutting, cutting the vein distal to the gall relative to the petiole, cutting the vein basal to the gall and cutting both sides. The average survival rate (live galls at the end of the experiment including healthy larvae, pupae or imagines inside) – was 28.9%. The rate varied depending on the treatment and was 13.6% in the treatment with the vein cut on both sides and about 30% in the remaining treatments. However, this difference was not statistically significant. The growth dynamics of galls are highly dependent on the experimental treatment. The largest galls grew in the control treatment, and the smallest galls were in the treatments with the veins cut on both sides. Unexpectedly, even cutting veins on both sides did not result in the immediate dieback of the galls. The results suggest that the galls are very strong nutrient and water sinks. The functions of the cut vein are likely taken over by other lower-order veins, allowing nourishment of the gall to complete larva development."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709256878c28a047393e57","5e70925f878c28a0473948eb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"136","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"527-534","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70925f878c28a0473948eb","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f6","5e709256878c28a047393e57"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789c6","mniswId":"12326","title":"JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH","issn":"0918-9440","eissn":"1618-0860","documentHash":"b0fda7d1-9484-4d79-9a63-30087e642d6d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66016f854097070f89ebf99b","year":"2023","volume":"136","number":"4","documentHash":"f41086c4-bf78-41bf-8002-c0eb8e8abbcf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Gall survival","Insect–plant interaction","Oak herbivores","Quercus petraea","Sessile oak"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059522459"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"660c285d4097076263dd8ed4","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Puchałka","documentHash":"fc6da3ed-18ff-4346-993c-070bdc524a7f"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9148","name":"Sonia","lastName":"Paź-Dyderska","uuid":"07A595CDB7DC1938816F30381CD8EF1DA3C26F5B470A7368007D7D40E2D6756E4BE2A3545086F603F57BE2C3B20FC6ABF96AAF90B7853B0B56AFF84E7301D121","orcidId":"0000-0001-9634-7479","documentHash":"aad5de05-5065-41c8-808d-45e54628b501"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473adbaa","name":"Beata","lastName":"Woziwoda","uuid":"1E6A3E57C79318B4ED14927EBDA9C8CEA92370262801419B1BA69D989E385CF2980629DDB6592706CB85BF473AAFEF3D40A075D14FD4AC2DE50D8BCDC54A8412","orcidId":"0000-0003-2270-2508","documentHash":"3f193deb-9147-4829-b7e9-e499dd247629"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Dyderski","uuid":"BA6020477E5CC315EB2E63B48E152FE36A33E8B3703BEC4812CECBFB0E0E652860C4E0E44BFA87F2AF6998A9580D130FEA7048AFDF4D7E950BC02A1F7F9A3632","orcidId":"0000-0003-4453-2781","documentHash":"6a027753-5078-4ffd-bbdc-95bb2c2a4c00"}],"objectId":"660c285d4097076263dd8ed3","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164483","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969723031042?via%3Dihub","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Climate change will cause climatic niche contraction of Vaccinium myrtillus L. and V. vitis-idaea L. in Europe","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We estimated climate niche shifts and threat levels under various climate change scenarios for Vaccinium myrtillus L. and V. vitis-idaea L.

The precipitation of the warmest quarter was the most important factor shaping the climatic niches of the studied species. We predicted the largest shifts in climate niches from the present to the 2040–2060 period, with the most pessimistic scenario predicting significant range losses for both species, mainly in Western Europe. Under the most optimistic SSP126 scenario, both species will lose 39 % of their climatic niche for both periods. In the worst-case scenario (SSP585) for 2061–2080, climatic niche contraction will cover 47 % and 39 % of the current climatic niche for V. myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea, respectively. The predicted changes in species distribution could have far-reaching consequences for temperate and boreal forests due to their crucial biocenotic role in forest ecosystems, high potential for carbon sequestration, and prevention of soil erosion.

for identifying and measuring the diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mycorrhiza is a mutualistic symbiosis between some plant species and a diverse group of soil fungi. Mycorrhizal symbiosis is categorized into discrete types based on the structural differences and the taxonomic position of involved plants and fungi. The main types of mycorrhiza include arbuscular, ericoid, orchid, monotropoid and ectomycorrhiza, the latter being the main focus of this review. Identifying ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) is crucial for understanding the ecology and preservation of rare and endangered plants, fungi and habitats. Thus, since the discovery of ectomycorrhiza, new identification methods have been constantly developed. This review tracks the history of EMF identification methods, presents their limitations and aims to discern the frontier of the field. The early methods were based on the morphology and anatomy of EMF, which allowed ectomycorrhizae formed by different EMF to be distinguished. Recognizing the EMF species that formed them, however, was difficult. The introduction of molecular methods that analysed taxon-specific DNA barcodes was a breakthrough in EMF identification, and the internal transcribed spacer gene was adopted as a routine fungal barcoding sequence. Identifying EMF from randomly sampled roots by morphology or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods results in rare EMF taxa being missed and underreported. This is addressed by bulk sampling combined with environmental DNA metabarcoding methods, which, in turn, yield a lower resolution of taxonomic identification. Most EMF identification methods incorporate PCR reactions, which are biased against some groups of EMF; developing PCR-free molecular methods would constitute a significant advancement. As the traditional concept of species is challenging for fungi, studying EMF functional rather than taxonomic diversity appears to be promising."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709261878c28a0473949fc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"96","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"639-652","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66277ffa4097072ea08a1922","5e709261878c28a0473949fc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d34","mniswId":"6742","title":"Forestry","issn":"0015-752X","eissn":"1464-3626","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b86c5856-ad70-443e-bfd0-763f1e5833d8"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI","DOUGLAS-FIR","OLD-GROWTHL","ENGTH POLYMORPHISMS","FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY","DNA","IDENTIFICATION","COMMUNITIES","MYCELIUM","SOIL"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059568696"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"648d1aa940e3ff055afbad3c","name":"Joao Paulo","lastName":"Rodrigues Martins","uuid":"2968C57B9DEB71FCFD39AD3B6BB061A51E46188FEF23BDF1C0528AEC174302FFF2464F76E23995A4DC98B5C64444ADE44E83E97025064F549073629D483DE31F","orcidId":"0000-0003-0554-6793","documentHash":"d5ef666c-de67-4c69-9e2f-205aca2d5ade"},{"objectId":"61ce79387523401fc10e7c26","name":"Juan","lastName":"Ley Lopez","uuid":"062947DB65FF04724BE20C9D139E1A1EE690AA36F5D5BC8A1BF0AAE3542D41A4409929755F9B5DBB87BA0B3DE588186533B52D5380C6B60797DFC9063E61E2CA","documentHash":"3a3e7e21-23f5-485a-a512-508d00a6a5f3"},{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Chmielarz","uuid":"856DB475E96758786F859939D96FF2F45BD85CB6AD60D9840A05952B12A24B26617EFE7FC6DABD99CCBD59C4C98E15B8DAD8FE07A70FAA4CC1AE06D6F7EE2945","documentHash":"4d7b8ab7-8ca8-431a-b26f-c3738e2eabe7"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8fc","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"AA2B99C3C5C95922E6B90B6A0077115CA183DD0020FCFE2EB69AC82808F79A087D0D6EC86BBE59046B257EAD936A69D4AD13E9C95245D3A25DF6B60E5508FF03","orcidId":"0000-0002-4297-5741","documentHash":"f7710694-9645-4c8d-a52f-053e3136073e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"662661b94097071fab4db194","doi":"10.1186/s13595-023-01205-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13595-023-01205-8.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Limiting temperatures of embryo growth and seed germination of Fraxinus excelsior L. (Oleaceae): a threshold model approach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Key message We have examined thermal control for embryo growth and seed germination in European ash. Using historical data (span of 36 years) of embryo index in matured seeds, we showed that maturation is not influenced by the annual average temperature. Secondary dormancy in ash’s seeds is easily induced, and the thermal window for both embryo growth and seed germination was between 10 and 20 °C.\nContext Seed germination plays a crucial role in establishing plant communities. Ash seeds are characterized by deep morphophysiological dormancy, usually overcome by 32 weeks of stratification. Observed climate changes might disrupt ash’s thermal window for embryo growth and seed germination. Thus, proper examination of seed adaptability can be important for forest management.\nAims We investigated the effect of temperature on the embryo index (ratio between embryo and seed length) as well as embryo growth and germination of European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) seeds under different thermal conditions.\nMethods We used seeds collected at the same site in Poland between 1985 and 2021 to first analyze the influence of the growing season on the initial embryo index in mature seeds. Subsequently, we examined embryo growth and germination of seeds at constant temperatures of 3°, 10°, 15°, 20°, 25°, and 30 °C from seeds collected in 2021. Using the modeled rate of embryo growth and germination, we predicted the cardinal temperatures for those processes in ash seeds.\nResults The embryo index of ash seeds varied; however, there was no relationship between the index and year of seed collection. The base temperature for embryo growth was 1.4 ± 1.1 °C, with a ceiling temperature of 29.9 ± 2.0 °C and an optimal temperature of 15.7 ± 0.3 °C. The base temperature for germination was at − 1.8 ± 0.3 °C. Due to the induction of secondary dormancy, the ceiling temperature of germination was impossible to establish. \nConclusions The initial embryo index of mature ash seeds seems to be an individual trait and was not affected by local average annual temperatures. The most effective temperature ranges for embryo growth and germination were similar, however narrow (between 10 and 15 °C). Temperatures above 20 °C inducted secondary dormancy, hampering embryo growth as well as germination. Such a narrow thermal window for embryo growth can potentially act as a limiting factor for the natural regeneration of ash seeds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["648d1aa940e3ff055afbad3c","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8fc","5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f","61ce79387523401fc10e7c26"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"80","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"38","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8fc","61ce79387523401fc10e7c26","648d1aa940e3ff055afbad3c","5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477072","mniswId":"1238","title":"Annals of Forest Science","issn":"1286-4560","eissn":"1297-966X","documentHash":"97db4f1f-2d59-41c4-ae44-2e95a6a88fda"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d4eaf84097072cdfe56b06","year":"2023","volume":"80","number":"1","documentHash":"9365619a-1152-4c5f-94ed-aa727f0ef9af"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Germination niche","Seeds","Threshold models","Cardinal temperatures","Embryo growth"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059571334"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6628df284097073ca7108248","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Janowski","documentHash":"488cffa4-9bb0-4f94-8897-cbcd99dbfda4"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a0473949fc","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Leski","uuid":"499B23F9100DF850755C238F9A97C7142B3BA38F5DDDFB0931102B9E1746E46A470F7665C5CA3E4BD70FD941A00BEF3E5864BF947DB02FA5EE70CB8B7506A0B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-4167-5015","documentHash":"0d2af209-8514-4188-bc47-8bacbc29178c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6628df284097073ca7108247","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-37538-7","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-37538-7.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Landscape-scale mapping of soil fungal distribution: proposing a new NGS-based approach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Soil fungi play an indispensable role in the functioning of terrestrial habitats. Most landscape-scale studies of soil fungal diversity try to identify the fungal taxa present at a study site and define the relationships between their abundance and environmental factors. The specific spatial distribution of these fungi over the site, however, is not addressed. Our study’s main objective is to propose a novel approach to landscape-scale mapping of soil fungi distribution using next generation sequencing and geographic information system applications. Furthermore, to test the proposed approach and discuss its performance, we aimed to conduct a case study mapping the spatial distribution of soil fungi on the Wielka Żuława island. The case study was performed on the Wielka Żuława island in northern Poland, where soil samples were collected every 100 m in an even grid. The fungal taxa and their relative abundance in each sample were assessed using the Illumina platform. Using the data obtained for the sampled points, maps of soil fungi spatial distribution were generated using three common interpolators: inverted distance weighted (IDW), B-spline, and ordinary Kriging. The proposed approach succeeded in creating maps of fungal distribution on Wielka Żuława. The most abundant groups of soil fungi were Penicillium on the genus level, Aspergillaceae on the family level, and ectomycorrhizal fungi on the trophic group level. Ordinary Kriging proved to be the most accurate at predicting relative abundance values for the groups of fungi significantly spatially autocorrelated at the sampled scale. For the groups of fungi not displaying spatial autocorrelation at the sampled scale, IDW provided the most accurate predictions of their relative abundance. Although less accurate at predicting exact relative abundance values, B-spline performed best in delineating the spatial patterns of soil fungi distribution. The proposed approach to landscape-scale mapping of soil fungi distribution could provide new insights into the ecology of soil fungi and terrestrial ecosystems in general. Producing maps of predicted fungal distribution in landscape-scale soil fungi diversity studies would also facilitate the reusability and replicability of the results. Outside the area of research, mapping the distribution of soil fungi could prove helpful in areas such as agriculture and forestry, nature conservation, and urban planning."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709261878c28a0473949fc","6628df284097073ca7108248"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"10280","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6628df284097073ca7108248","5e709261878c28a0473949fc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c9446b4097074220cc9a4d","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"c67bc404-c55a-4843-9947-5a16b4a7fe91"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SPATIAL INTERPOLATION,","COMMUNITY STRUCTURE,","FOREST,","DIVERSITY,","ERGOSTEROL,","ABUNDANCE,","ACCURACY,","PLANT,","DNA"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059571435"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6629025e4097073ca712efa2","name":"Eduardo","lastName":"Chacón-Madrigal","documentHash":"762dde45-5d9c-4589-98ba-4fcba15d2021"},{"objectId":"61ce79387523401fc10e7c26","name":"Juan","lastName":"Ley Lopez","uuid":"062947DB65FF04724BE20C9D139E1A1EE690AA36F5D5BC8A1BF0AAE3542D41A4409929755F9B5DBB87BA0B3DE588186533B52D5380C6B60797DFC9063E61E2CA","documentHash":"3a3e7e21-23f5-485a-a512-508d00a6a5f3"},{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Chmielarz","uuid":"856DB475E96758786F859939D96FF2F45BD85CB6AD60D9840A05952B12A24B26617EFE7FC6DABD99CCBD59C4C98E15B8DAD8FE07A70FAA4CC1AE06D6F7EE2945","documentHash":"4d7b8ab7-8ca8-431a-b26f-c3738e2eabe7"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8fc","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"AA2B99C3C5C95922E6B90B6A0077115CA183DD0020FCFE2EB69AC82808F79A087D0D6EC86BBE59046B257EAD936A69D4AD13E9C95245D3A25DF6B60E5508FF03","orcidId":"0000-0002-4297-5741","documentHash":"f7710694-9645-4c8d-a52f-053e3136073e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6629025e4097073ca712ef9f","doi":"10.1007/s10531-023-02565-3","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10531-023-02565-3.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Seed traits and tropical arboreal species conservation: a case study of a highly diverse tropical humid forest region in Southern Costa Rica","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tropical areas are vital for conserving endangered tree species. However, barriers to the propagation and storage of plant material still limit preservation outcomes. Seed traits are essential in conservation but have rarely been applied in the tropics. In this work, we compile information about the germination and seed desiccation tolerance behaviour of 953 arboreal species from the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. We analysed how those traits are related to the growing strata, seed size, and dispersal mode and how they can be used to improve conservation initiatives based on the species distribution, abundance, extinction risk, and ex situ cultivation. Over a third of the species are probably recalcitrant but this number increase to almost half among the endangered and endemic ones. Most species have seeds dispersed by animals, but wind dispersal is usually orthodox and dominant in secondary forests. All species with tiny seeds and most understorey ones with small seeds are orthodox. Approximately half of the species have dormant seeds, while nearly one-third of nondormant species have cohorts with extended germination. Almost half of the species are conserved ex situ; however, several endangered, endemics could be expected to be considered exceptional. Seed traits could target orthodox species for seed banking in tropical forests, including the potential of secondary forests and a subset of oligarch species. For the recalcitrant ones, approaches based on the risk of extinction, distribution, abundance, and ex situ status allow for prioritizing collection and conservation strategies.

In this study, the effects of individual and combined effects of drought (at different phenological stages) and salt stresses on growth, morphology, and physiology of triticale were evaluated. For this purpose, a 3 x 4 factorial design in three blocks experiment was conducted. The stress treatments included three levels of salinity (0, 50, and 100 mM NaCl) and four levels of drought (regular irrigation as well as irrigation disruption at heading, flowering, and kernel extension stages). The stresses, individual as well as combined, caused a significant decrease in chlorophyll contents, total dry matter, leaf area index, relative water content, and grain yield of triticale. In this regard, the highest reduction was recorded under combined stresses of 100 mM NaCl and drought stress at flowering. However, an increase in soluble sugars, leaf free proline, carotenoid contents, and electrolyte leakage was noted under stress conditions compared to the control. In this regard, the highest increase in leaf free proline, soluble sugars, and carotenoid contents were noted under the\ncombination of severe salinity and drought stress imposed at the flowering stage. Investigating the growth indices in severe salinity and water deficit stress in different phenological stages shows the predominance of ionic stress over osmotic stress under severe salinity. The highest grain yield was observed under non-saline well-watered conditions whereas the lowest grain yield was recorded under severe salinity and drought stress imposed at the flowering stage. In conclusion, the flowering stage was more sensitive than the heading and kernel extension stages in terms of water deficit. The impact\nof salinity and water deficit was more pronounced on soluble sugars and leaf free proline; so, these criteria can be used as physiological indicators for drought and salinity tolerance in triticale."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709261878c28a047394a2b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"8896","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6627aa0f4097072ea08dff6d","6627aa0f4097072ea08dff6e","6627aa0f4097072ea08dff6f","5e709261878c28a047394a2b","6627aa0f4097072ea08dff71","6627aa0f4097072ea08dff72","6627aa0f4097072ea08dff73","6627aa0f4097072ea08dff74"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c9446b4097074220cc9a4d","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"c67bc404-c55a-4843-9947-5a16b4a7fe91"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SALINITY STRESS,","PHYSIOLOGICAL-CHARACTERISTICS,","GENETIC-VARIATION,","WATER RELATIONS,","WHEAT,","TOLERANCE,","GENOTYPES,","PROLINE,","YIELD,","METABOLISM"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059571701"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6690f267fdbe83399d7939ec","name":"Richárd","lastName":"László","documentHash":"2d1c4cdf-8077-496f-8d30-d51ff1b3a840"},{"objectId":"5e70939f878c28a0473adf84","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Wójkiewicz","uuid":"A2AAB1F519315C8DD88B93156AED89B6CBABAAEB47C7CD1175201CC2EE7020ADC81DA50D435A13FB6B48F112EF72C58F948F33893F1B88BA15A1B4A3467B2C14","orcidId":"0000-0003-0111-6489","documentHash":"0cf504aa-b12f-484b-b862-c4a27d03d185"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473aca3a","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Żukowska","uuid":"B00CEC36E1DD7394374A7FD8AA13E7C6CA220A48C6005537AE5DDBBD2D4466B7FE0589C8566129A3B8A55671D3A46B44070DB2FBC03EEC8B914A123A8E21A803","orcidId":"0000-0002-5273-4431","documentHash":"c487e759-992b-4ec6-aa32-47b2a9193a85"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394a4b","name":"Witold","lastName":"Wachowiak","uuid":"C26062D41DB33086B107BD526D6E2C9E3C8088D15F5B546A988D1C4503B9F46279C01A5B4CE21F5984C4BFB3036F365FD93F5AC4F16088627CCD320179599AEC","orcidId":"0000-0003-2898-3523","documentHash":"e85235e3-e1b0-48e3-88ea-772ee8162970"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393e71","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Lewandowski","uuid":"37172BE2A1A0DEB91A6DDA44E1AA99AB6E12F59D904D230E4D3AB49F68473C93ED3E677CFADBDCF4095D28FA7F81A9B3C9C17538047BC1D10C28440F5A2A2F2E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9503-1541","documentHash":"acf267b9-199f-456e-8802-fe7a1d4f1eaf"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6626663c4097071fab4dcc97","doi":"10.1186/s13595-023-01207-6","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Genetic variation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Eurasia: impact of postglacial recolonization and human-mediated gene transfer","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec>\r\n                <jats:title>Key message</jats:title>\r\n                <jats:p>The range-wide level of genetic variation of Scots pine (<jats:italic>Pinus sylvestris</jats:italic> L.) is geographically structured.

It appears that Central Europe and Fennoscandia share at least one glacial refugium in the Balkans and migrants from higher latitudes, as well as from south-eastern regions. The low genetic structure between Central Europe and Fennoscandia, along with their high genetic admixture, may result at least partially from past human activities related to the transfer of germplasm in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In light of ongoing climate changes and projected range shifts of Scots pine, conservation strategies are especially needed for marginal and isolated stands of this species. Genetic research should also be complemented in parts of the species distribution that have thus far been poorly studied.</jats:p>\r\n              </jats:sec>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","uid":"bPE2PjbeOl7yC2KHqaQECkQ","uuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","name":"Uniwersytet im.

We examined the gene pool of Taxus baccata along latitudinal gradients in the Hyrcanian forest from west to east using 15 simple sequence repeat markers (SSR). A high level of genetic diversity and a signiﬁcant level of ﬁxation index was observed, and the populations showed spatial genetic structure. The ﬁxation index ranged from 0.027 to 0.197. In six out of eleven populations inbreeding was the sig-niﬁcant factor inﬂuencing deviation from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. There was no bottleneck eﬀect in any of the analysed populations and the global Fst with ENA correction was 0.044. The average total number of migrants per generation ranged from 4.93 to 2.14. Under the six tested scenarios, the DIYABC analysis showed that the eastern and western parts of the Hyrcanian yew forests split about 134 generations ago but these two pools meet in the central part of these forests about 49 generations ago. Although the genetic diver-sity of T. baccata in the Hyrcanian forest is relatively high, it is expected that the inbreed-ing depression will increase over time, causing the accumulation of destructive alleles and intensifying the extinction process. This process is caused by anthropogenic activities, hab-itat fragmentations, the age of the trees, low regenerations, the existence of high geographi-cal barriers, and a signiﬁcant reduction in gene ﬂow among the habitats."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["609badcb9543c73526c48ddc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1733-1753","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["662901074097073ca712da34","662901074097073ca712da35","662901074097073ca712da36","662901074097073ca712da37","609badcb9543c73526c48ddc","662901074097073ca712da39"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477328","mniswId":"2401","title":"BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","issn":"0960-3115","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"2298a3aa-665e-4b49-bbdb-52037cc8cd53"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"662901074097073ca712da33","year":"2023","volume":"32","number":"5","documentHash":"4dfc4bce-71f6-4da1-b2b8-1e34fd7536b3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Anthropogenic activities","Dioecious tree species","In situ conservation","Habitat fragmentation","SSR markers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059575266"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9148","name":"Sonia","lastName":"Paź-Dyderska","uuid":"07A595CDB7DC1938816F30381CD8EF1DA3C26F5B470A7368007D7D40E2D6756E4BE2A3545086F603F57BE2C3B20FC6ABF96AAF90B7853B0B56AFF84E7301D121","orcidId":"0000-0001-9634-7479","documentHash":"aad5de05-5065-41c8-808d-45e54628b501"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"03F14E2076FEABB44CC7B743F6FD9B59C0B3CE3F788CFE10E84226C037F019164ED6EE4E61A04DD072E5640611915200DC9689ED62B57A29F869C4D59C6D63FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-0985","documentHash":"002defbf-325a-404d-a301-7cc974eec233"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"662b8b824097075aa61186de","doi":"10.1002/ece3.9979","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.9979","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"In search of a perfect trait set: A workflow presentation based on the conservation status assessment of Poland's dendroflora","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Considering the dynamically changing environment, we cannot be sure whether we are using the best possible plant functional traits to explain ecological mechanisms.

Importantly, traits representing different plant organs should be included whenever possible: Three of the four best models from our comparison were the ones that included traits of various plant organs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","5e709442878c28a0473b9148"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"e9979","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709442878c28a0473b9148","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779fd","mniswId":"5330","title":"Ecology and Evolution","issn":"2045-7758","eissn":"2045-7758","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"73ae90c2-19e2-4cc3-b598-264f4e3bd23c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"647738814097071bcb5a9a3c","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"4","documentHash":"7161c07b-a35d-43dc-9d22-255f3ec4feba"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["conservation status","data availability","ecological modeling","explanator y power","functional traits","plant organs"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059575462"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"662f67a54097070cfa02c97c","name":"Antelmo Ralph","lastName":"Falqueto","documentHash":"a10cb52e-f8fc-4442-ae9c-60059edb4852"},{"objectId":"662f67a54097070cfa02c97b","name":"Andreia Barcelos Passos Lima","lastName":"Gontijo","documentHash":"5d780f97-3334-406c-8c19-a2a33d215407"},{"objectId":"662f67a54097070cfa02c97a","name":"Diolina Moura","lastName":"Silva","documentHash":"b409ee98-574d-49aa-829b-1eaaf6a456a9"},{"objectId":"662f67a54097070cfa02c979","name":"Mariela Mattos da","lastName":"Silva","documentHash":"14632c58-a581-4bae-bcdb-0a8c01baed90"},{"objectId":"662f67a54097070cfa02c978","name":"Lorenzo Toscano","lastName":"Conde","documentHash":"ef610ab4-59e5-4392-9ffe-3fa8dfa4e600"},{"objectId":"662f67a54097070cfa02c976","name":"Rosiane","lastName":"Cipriano","documentHash":"25b349fd-4607-41a3-9180-e7b93a9c1c58"},{"objectId":"648d1aa940e3ff055afbad3c","name":"Joao Paulo","lastName":"Rodrigues Martins","uuid":"2968C57B9DEB71FCFD39AD3B6BB061A51E46188FEF23BDF1C0528AEC174302FFF2464F76E23995A4DC98B5C64444ADE44E83E97025064F549073629D483DE31F","orcidId":"0000-0003-0554-6793","documentHash":"d5ef666c-de67-4c69-9e2f-205aca2d5ade"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"662f67a54097070cfa02c975","doi":"10.7717/peerj.14624","publicUri":"https://peerj.com/articles/14624.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Anatomical and physiological responses of <i>Aechmea blanchetiana</i> (Bromeliaceae) induced by silicon and sodium chloride stress during <i>in vitro</i> culture","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Salt stress is one of the most severe abiotic stresses affecting plant growth and development. The application of silicon (Si) is an alternative that can increase the tolerance of plants to various types of biotic and abiotic stresses.

For this purpose, plants already established in vitro were transferred to a culture medium with 0 or 14 µM of Si (CaSiO3). After growth for 30 days, a stationary liquid medium containing different concentrations of NaCl (0, 100, 200, or 300 µM) was added to the flasks. Anatomical and physiological analyses were performed after growth for 45 days. The plants cultivated with excess NaCl presented reduced root diameter and effective photochemical quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) (ΦPSII) and increased non-photochemical dissipation of fluorescence (qN). Plants that grew with the presence of Si also had greater content of photosynthetic pigments and activity of the enzymes of the antioxidant system, as well as higher values of maximum quantum yield of PSII (FV/FM), photochemical dissipation coefficient of fluorescence (qP) and fresh weight bioaccumulation of roots and shoots. The anatomical, physiological and biochemical responses, and growth induced by Si mitigated the effect of salt stress on the A. blanchetiana plants cultivated in vitro, which can be partly explained by the tolerance of this species to grow in sandbank (Restinga) areas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["648d1aa940e3ff055afbad3c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"e14624","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["662f67a54097070cfa02c976","648d1aa940e3ff055afbad3c","662f67a54097070cfa02c978","662f67a54097070cfa02c979","662f67a54097070cfa02c97a","662f67a54097070cfa02c97b","662f67a54097070cfa02c97c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454791e1","mniswId":"15841","title":"PeerJ","issn":"2167-8359","eissn":"2167-8359","documentHash":"19ef043f-10d2-400d-b8dc-7fc8f39d4358"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d398474097070bb2f8e6f3","year":"2023","volume":"11","documentHash":"7d8fdcbc-62ab-48ef-805c-a4b6036b7547"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bromeliads","Modulated fluorescence","Tolerance","Plant tissue culture","Salinity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059578918"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"662f51034097070cfa01454f","name":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Picchio","documentHash":"6e27b58d-73d5-431d-bc4a-6401541a7b03"},{"objectId":"662f51034097070cfa01454e","name":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Civitarese","documentHash":"294e17c1-8ddc-4ae2-9aa0-c164df2107bb"},{"objectId":"662f51034097070cfa01454c","name":"Rachele","lastName":"Venanzi","documentHash":"566c8750-eafe-4bd5-a683-264d913c43de"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c999","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Latterini","uuid":"CACEB340446FB4D6658D01649C4614E61499A61641F167AFFBC6344D44E8291B61B43C50E527B5275449413154134E7EACD6FF854AACC44F14ACA9A37487CF08","orcidId":"0000-0001-7401-8754","documentHash":"7c970a18-8b3d-4160-8189-e32a1aab4e44"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"662f51034097070cfa01454b","doi":"10.3390/f14071503","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/14/7/1503/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Recent Applications of Smart Technologies for Monitoring the Sustainability of Forest Operations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Precision forestry is a useful technique to help forest stakeholders with proper sustainableforest management.

In this review, we summarised thecurrent level of knowledge regarding the use of precision forestry techniques for monitoring forestoperations. We concentrated on recent data from the last ﬁve years (2019–2023). We demonstratedhow an Industry 4.0 strategy for remote and proximal monitoring of working performance canbe effective when using CAN-bus and StanForD data collected by modern forest machines. Thesame information can be effectively used to create maps of soil trafﬁcability and to evaluate thepatterns of skid tracks or strip roads built as a result of forest intervention. Similar informationcan be gathered in the case of small-scale forestry by using GNSS-RF (Global Navigation SatelliteSystems—Radio Frequency) or even monitoring systems based on smartwatches or smartphones.LiDAR and Structure for Motion (SfM) photogrammetry are both useful tools for tracking soil ruttingand disturbances caused by the passage of forest machinery. SfM offers denser point clouds anda more approachable method, whereas laser scanning can be considerably faster but needs a moreexperienced operator and better data-processing skills. Finally, in terms of the social componentof sustainability, the use of location sharing technologies is strongly advised, based for instance onGNSS—RF to monitor the security of forest workers as they operate."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1503","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["662f51034097070cfa01454c","62c796a8752340480571c999","662f51034097070cfa01454e","662f51034097070cfa01454f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d36","mniswId":"6744","title":"Forests","issn":"1999-4907","eissn":"1999-4907","documentHash":"05b7b2b7-d675-43a7-91dd-8446464e53a5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"649d7b3740970720a8607654","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"7","documentHash":"c15e2a79-b36a-4928-b7bb-3bdc030622c2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable forest operations","Industry (/Forestry) 4.0","CAN-bus","StanForD","soil disturbance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059578923"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"662f5f774097070cfa022154","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Łabiszak","documentHash":"87a00bba-7133-4c08-abc5-8050fb559283"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394a4b","name":"Witold","lastName":"Wachowiak","uuid":"C26062D41DB33086B107BD526D6E2C9E3C8088D15F5B546A988D1C4503B9F46279C01A5B4CE21F5984C4BFB3036F365FD93F5AC4F16088627CCD320179599AEC","orcidId":"0000-0003-2898-3523","documentHash":"e85235e3-e1b0-48e3-88ea-772ee8162970"}],"objectId":"662f5f774097070cfa022153","doi":"10.1111/jse.13013","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jse.13013","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Mid‐Pleistocene events influenced the current spatial structure of genetic diversity in Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is one of the most important tree species of the temperate and boreal zones in Eurasia. Its wide distribution range and current patterns of genetic variation have been influenced by Quaternary climatic oscillations and the demographic processes connected to them. In order to better understand the relationship between evolutionary history and demographic factors in a widespread species with a large genome, we used the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to genotype thousands of SNP markers across 62 natural populations (N = 686 trees) of Scots pine in Eurasia. This provides the largest range-wide SNPs' genetic diversity assessment of Scots pine to date. Our findings show evidence of past admixture events between genetic clusters that were retained despite the potential for effective pollen-mediated gene flow across the species' distribution range. We also examined the contemporary population structure of the species and analyzed the range-wide genetic diversity patterns. Phylogenetic analyses and demographic modeling suggest that the observed divergence patterns between genetic lineages likely predate the last glaciation events. Two of the most distinctive groups are represented by trees from the eastern parts of Fennoscandia and Eastern Russia, which have remained separated since the mid-Pleistocene. The patterns of genetic variation also confirm the dual colonization of Fennoscandia and the existence of an admixture zone in Central Europe that was formed during multiple waves of postglacial recolonization. This study provides insights into the genetic relationships of Scots pine populations from Europe and Asia and offers a more comprehensive understanding of the species' history."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709261878c28a047394a4b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"62","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"561-576","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["662f5f774097070cfa022154","5e709261878c28a047394a4b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478ad0","mniswId":"12774","title":"Journal of Systematics and Evolution","issn":"1674-4918","eissn":"1759-6831","documentHash":"1cb2255a-a4e2-4781-a605-1a9479d8a0c4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64411343409707555e80dddc","year":"2023","documentHash":"db7bc727-eb24-4d53-8662-9732b6b0b997"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["admixture","divergence","glacial refugia","postglacial recolonization","SNP arrays","population structure"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059581670"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66570dca409707281755b5eb","name":"Hassan M.","lastName":"Alzain","documentHash":"3033fcbc-8a6c-4352-84b5-fa019f51dfa9"},{"objectId":"66570dca409707281755b5ea","name":"Lassina","lastName":"Sanou","documentHash":"e9a40efa-b3f6-409c-95f7-dafe906217b3"},{"objectId":"66570dca409707281755b5e9","name":"Reginald Tang","lastName":"Guuroh","documentHash":"40d831b9-f103-448f-9a1a-9969aea7d28f"},{"objectId":"66570dca409707281755b5e8","name":"Soumya","lastName":"Ghosh","documentHash":"ccf694fb-582b-4933-b6d6-80d64233fa8b"},{"objectId":"66570dca409707281755b5e7","name":"Abdul-Moomin Ansong","lastName":"Salifu","documentHash":"cc46f932-7cc4-4643-a53f-f2e94e3b91cd"},{"objectId":"66570dca409707281755b5e6","name":"Hadeer Abdulrahman","lastName":"Rady","documentHash":"05a66e52-1c03-4b5d-988e-3b25b6c1486f"},{"objectId":"66570dca409707281755b5e5","name":"Samuel Kuria","lastName":"Kiboi","documentHash":"0fd20aac-fca7-44e1-91c3-aac519e27ad6"},{"objectId":"66570dca409707281755b5e4","name":"Charné","lastName":"Bornman","documentHash":"f59bd49c-9c52-4a94-ac0a-2d1383a90537"},{"objectId":"66570dca409707281755b5e3","name":"Michael","lastName":"Remon","documentHash":"66aa176c-9c80-4635-aa0a-1c65e14444ea"},{"objectId":"66570dca409707281755b5e1","name":"Esraa","lastName":"Omar","documentHash":"8d3367db-4573-4926-aabe-2b2083fa5f08"},{"objectId":"66570dca409707281755b5e0","name":"Mubaraka S.","lastName":"Alghariani","documentHash":"f9fc3086-be33-4d32-96fd-161db6e69f07"},{"objectId":"66570dca409707281755b5df","name":"Heba","lastName":"Bedair","documentHash":"1c75cdfb-9556-42c7-8d95-14989cdc8924"},{"objectId":"60c34e5f9543c72336544474","name":"Quadri","lastName":"Anibaba","uuid":"E054E1E07A82108713D59567A7381EF6418D06B291A8B6CF2F865211D533AC1AB08A87C84A4E7328A403AC6DE26F4F75CCC8091EB318925B67A820DDBA661A13","orcidId":"0000-0002-5195-2920","documentHash":"940abcd3-f5c9-4ace-a878-dea83fbd8b57"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-01","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":0,"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66570dca409707281755b5dd","doi":"10.1007/s41742-023-00534-w","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s41742-023-00534-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Global Warming Status in the African Continent: Sources, Challenges, Policies, and Future Direction","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Africa is the second largest continent after Asia, having a larger than 30 million km(2) area. Doubtlessly, one of the biggest ecological and societal problems of the twenty-first century is climate change. Since the early 1970s, it has been clear that Africa is already experiencing the effects of climate change, and it has given rise to a wide range of new and unusual phenomena, such as rising temperatures, poor agricultural output, extreme different weather scenarios, and the spread of disease, among other things. Therefore, the current review aims at screening the impact of climate change on agricultural sector, human health and food security in Africa compared to the other continents, evaluating the change projections in future and highlighting the role of African leaders in mitigating and adapting to these effects. Artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and high-tech algorithms were applied to analyze these effects. Historical data were downloaded in near real-time from January 2009 to the present from the FAO Water Productivity Open-access portal WaPOR and Terra Climate datasets on Earth Engine platform. Assessment process was performed using Google Earth Engine, whereas future data were downloaded from WorldClim 2.1. We used 2021-2040 timelines and two scenarios: SSP245 and SSP585. For the SSP and timeline, we downloaded four versions, based on four different global circulation models (GCMs): IPSL-CM6A-LR (France), MRI-ESM2-0 (Japan), CanESM5 (Canadian), and BCC-CSM2-MR (China), to reflect the uncertainty among GCMs. We averaged future projection of each variable and SSP across four GCMs to decrease the uncertainty connected with a particular GCM. We presented the averaged results as maps. Annual precipitation totals were significantly above average in Central and East Africa, while under SSP 245 scenario, Madagascar would experience high rainfall. The highest temperature anomalies were seen in parts of the Greater Horn of Africa, western equatorial regions, and the north-western part of the continent. Minimum and Maximum temperature predictions showed that Africa would experience harsh temperatures than previously recorded in the historical years. A high average maximum temperature is predicted across the sub-Sahara Africa, South Africa, Somalia, and Madagascar under SSP 245 and SSP 585. The MCD64A1 dataset tagged in Earth Engine was used to classify forest fire risk in Africa. Analysis revealed that the highest fire risk was recorded in Savannah in tropical and subtropical Africa. Further, changes in rainfall and increased temperature leading to increased evaporation would directly reduce runoff levels and recharge groundwater which in turn will have negative effects on biodiversity, agriculture, and food security. Notably, African leaders have played positive role in the recent climate negotiations and bright climate initiatives have been emerged.

In this study, we produced a comprehensive checklist of alien plants in Nigeria from online flora databases, herbarium records, published field surveys, and questionnaires administered to botanical gardens. The resulting alien flora was classified into naturalized, invasive, and cultivated plants. We then fitted a random forest model to identify the attributes which facilitate the naturalization of alien plants in Nigeria. We also used separate chi-squared tests to investigate if the frequency of these attributes is significantly different between the naturalized and invasive plants. The results include 1,381 alien plant taxa, comprising 238 naturalized, 190 invasive, and 953 cultivated species. The naturalized and invasive plants (428 species) are from 91 families, with Fabaceae and Poaceae having the highest representations. The random forest model showed that life forms and local economic uses were the most important drivers of alien plant naturalization in Nigeria. Chi-squared tests revealed a non-random distribution of life forms, higher frequencies of naturalized plants from the Indomalaya and the Neotropics, greater introductions during the British colonial rule, and that naturalized species are mostly used for medicinal, ornamental, food, or animal fodder purposes. Naturalized and invasive plants were recorded in all regions of Nigeria and are mostly found in urban and agricultural landscapes. This baseline information can support further ecological studies and conservation actions in Nigeria."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c34e5f9543c72336544474"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"3677-3696","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["665713544097072817560569","66571354409707281756056a","60c34e5f9543c72336544474","66571354409707281756056c","66571354409707281756056d","66571354409707281756056e","66571354409707281756056f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477346","mniswId":"2440","title":"BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS","issn":"1387-3547","eissn":"1573-1464","documentHash":"09bb049f-6f41-4977-82e5-0aea4e67bd46"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"665713544097072817560568","year":"2023","volume":"25","number":"12","documentHash":"6100a0f1-94c2-402d-9256-8799afb5605c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biological invasion,","Naturalization,","Life forms,","Nigeria"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059607891"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6661a1fd409707458fb7eea1","name":"Jutta","lastName":"Ludwig-Mueller","documentHash":"40b38d84-767b-4438-97d9-a1475488603a"},{"objectId":"6661a1fd409707458fb7eea0","name":"Monika","lastName":"Höfer","documentHash":"815b373e-bba6-4540-b2a6-23c94c896cf3"},{"objectId":"6661a1fd409707458fb7ee9f","name":"Elliosha","lastName":"Hajari","documentHash":"d5043698-1846-4dc0-a683-30beabb38cb7"},{"objectId":"6661a1fd409707458fb7ee9d","name":"Byron E.","lastName":"Zevallos-Bravo","documentHash":"c3e40b3f-78fc-463a-bb4f-431375fc4461"},{"objectId":"6661a1fd409707458fb7ee9c","name":"Yanier","lastName":"Acosta","documentHash":"7bedbb2b-f8bd-4398-a638-2d3ae650b87c"},{"objectId":"6661a1fd409707458fb7ee9b","name":"José Carlos","lastName":"Lorenzo","documentHash":"b65fdb73-0224-476e-a7c2-5e0e1bbb8d52"},{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Chmielarz","uuid":"856DB475E96758786F859939D96FF2F45BD85CB6AD60D9840A05952B12A24B26617EFE7FC6DABD99CCBD59C4C98E15B8DAD8FE07A70FAA4CC1AE06D6F7EE2945","documentHash":"4d7b8ab7-8ca8-431a-b26f-c3738e2eabe7"}],"objectId":"6661a1fd409707458fb7ee99","doi":"10.54680/fr23610110612","publicUri":"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/cryo/cryo/2023/00000044/00000006/art00007","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Exposure of Maize Seeds to Liquid Nitrogen Modifies the Morphology and Hormonal Response of Young Plants","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BACKGROUND: Cryopreservation currently represents the most suitable strategy for the long-term conservation of plant germplasm. While much effort has focused on the development of protocols to enable successful cryostorage, there are few, if any reports, that consider the effect of cryogenic temperatures on the phytohormone status of the seed and developing seedlings. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of cryopreservation on external seed coat features as well as levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) in maize. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups of seeds at 6% moisture content were compared: one was maintained at 4 degrees C (control) while the other was exposed to LN within cryo-vials. RESULTS: Seeds exposed to cryogenic temperatures were characterized by the presence of large cracks in the seed coat compared with control seeds. Cryogenic exposure also resulted in a reduction in biomass and plant height. Results from the phytohormone analysis showed an initial reduction in the levels of IAA, ABA and ACC after 7 days of growth followed by sharp increase in levels relative to the control by 14 days. Whilst the roles of ABA and ethylene (and by extension, its precursor ACC) are well studied as stress response molecules, much less is known about the potentially vital role of auxins in regulating plant growth under conditions of low temperature stress. CONCLUSION: It is postulated that the interaction of all three hormones modulate crosstalk between various stress responses and recovery pathways to ameliorate the damage caused by freezing stress and enable plant survival. Given the dearth of information on phytohormones in cryobiology, more studies are needed to fully elucidate these relationships in the context of freezing stress caused by liquid nitrogen."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"44","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"369-377","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6661a1fd409707458fb7ee9b","6661a1fd409707458fb7ee9c","6661a1fd409707458fb7ee9d","5e7093b1878c28a0473af51f","6661a1fd409707458fb7ee9f","6661a1fd409707458fb7eea0","6661a1fd409707458fb7eea1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477848","mniswId":"4564","title":"CRYOLETTERS","issn":"0143-2044","eissn":"1742-0644","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"6bf4a7fe-1159-492d-a52f-2bd693b03367"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6661a1fd409707458fb7ee9a","year":"2023","volume":"44","number":"6","documentHash":"b7169f93-2d20-4e1e-a0e8-a1fce43c088d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cryopreservation,","plant growth regulators,","scanning electron microscopy,","Zea mays L."]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059612248"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6661b164409707458fbb1335","name":"El-Sayed M.","lastName":"Desoky","documentHash":"48efcef7-58e6-48e8-a948-080d3e0e0eef"},{"objectId":"6661b164409707458fbb1334","name":"Jia","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"803e597d-20be-4d41-adff-db07dcb67796"},{"objectId":"6661b164409707458fbb1333","name":"Xin","lastName":"Zhao","documentHash":"de68483d-fd98-4ba8-b0a8-fbddfc3a0a20"},{"objectId":"6661b164409707458fbb1332","name":"Kuan","lastName":"Yan","documentHash":"1d9207e2-b750-455d-8008-59b760aa9e5e"},{"objectId":"6661b164409707458fbb1331","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Ihtisham","documentHash":"7e61ad71-f9d6-4d49-b0eb-b4f91bfa4ecb"},{"objectId":"6661b164409707458fbb132f","name":"Linghui","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"27244db8-8435-494d-8923-859312496f26"},{"objectId":"6661b164409707458fbb132e","name":"Hayssam M.","lastName":"Ali","documentHash":"5b6ae46a-59ec-4702-b278-dfd7f4b0475f"},{"objectId":"6661b164409707458fbb132d","name":"Mostafa M.","lastName":"Rady","documentHash":"932b3334-7016-4dd0-b27c-a70c5f4f9f2b"},{"objectId":"6661b164409707458fbb132c","name":"Mohamed A.

However, the effect of silymarin and clove fruit extract (CFE) on wheat plants grown under cadmium (Cd) stress has not been studied. MethodsWheat seeds were planted in plastic pots filled with ions-free sand. A 1/2-strength Hoagland's nutrient solution was used for irrigation. Pots were treated with eight treatments thirteen days after sowing: 1) Control, 2) 0.5 mM silymarin foliar application [silymarin], 3) 2% CFE foliar application [CFE], 4) CFE enriched with silymarin (0.24 g silymarin L-1 of CFE) [CFE-silymarin], 5) Watering wheat seedlings with a nutritious solution of 2 mM Cd [Cd]. 6) Cadmium + silymarin, 7) Cadmium + CFE, and 8) Cadmium + CFE-silymarin. The experimental design was a completely randomized design with nine replicates. Results and discussionThe Cd stress decreased grain yield, shoot dry weight, leaf area, carotenoids, chlorophylls, stomatal conductance, net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, membrane stability index, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content by 66.9, 60.6, 56.7, 23.8, 33.5, 48.1, 41.2, 48.7, 42.5, 24.1, 39.9, and 24.1%, respectively. On the other hand, Cd has an Application of CFE, silymarin, or CEF-silymarin for wheat plants grown under Cd stress, significantly improved all investigated biochemical, morphological, and physiological variables and enhanced the antioxidant enzyme activities. Applying CFE and/or silymarin enhanced plant tolerance to Cd stress more efficiently.

the most extensive grassland cover in the world, providing valuable ecosystem services. African grasslands, like other continental grasslands, are prone to various anthropogenic disturbances and climate, and require data-driven monitoring for efficient functioning and service delivery. Yet, knowledge of how the African grassland cover has changed in the past years is lacking, especially at the subcontinent level, due to lack of relevant long-term, Africa-wide observations and experiments. In this study, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Type (MCD12Q1) data spanning 2001 to 2017 to conduct land use land cover (LULC) change analyses and map grassland distribution in Africa. Specifically, we assessed the changes in grassland cover across and within African subcontinents over three periods (2001-2013, 2013-2017, and 2001-2017). We found that the African grassland cover was 16,777,765.5 km(2), 16,999,468.25 km(2), and 16,968,304.25 km(2) in 2001, 2013, and 2017, respectively. There were net gain (1.32%) and net loss (- 0.19%) during 2001-2013 and 2013-2017 periods, respectively, and the annual rate of change during these periods were 0.11% and - 0.05%, respectively. Generally, the African grassland cover increased by 1.14% (0.07% per annum) over the entire study period (2001-2017) at the expense of forestland, cropland, and built-up areas. The East and West African grassland cover reduced by 0.07% (- 0.02% per annum) and 1.35% (- 0.34% per annum), respectively from 2013 to 2017 but increased in other periods. On the other hand, the grassland cover in North and Central Africa increased throughout the three periods while that of Southern Africa decreased over the three periods. Overall, the net gains in the grassland cover of other African subcontinents offset the loss in Southern Africa and promoted the overall gain across Africa. This study underscores the need for continuous monitoring of African grasslands and the causes of their changes for efficient delivery of ecosystem services."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c34e5f9543c72336544474"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"195","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"621","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["665715824097072817561229","66571582409707281756122a","66571582409707281756122b","66571582409707281756122c","66571582409707281756122d","66571582409707281756122e","66571582409707281756122f","665715824097072817561230","665715824097072817561231","60c34e5f9543c72336544474"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b0b","mniswId":"5832","title":"Environmental Monitoring and Assessment","issn":"0167-6369","eissn":"1573-2959","documentHash":"5638a9db-ba18-46d2-a59e-9fa77e068298"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"665715824097072817561228","year":"2023","volume":"195","number":"5","documentHash":"6c0a6408-655c-47c7-972b-01ead7fa3daf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Africa,","Ecosystem,","Land use land cover,","MODIS,","Savanna"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059628540"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6660300440970740074edaa6","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Khmil","documentHash":"afa57b7c-3207-406a-a78f-3297e965ed0d"},{"objectId":"6660300440970740074edaa5","name":"Maria","lastName":"Seniv","documentHash":"0386ed9e-713a-4e1d-80dd-6717b6b02d51"},{"objectId":"6660300440970740074edaa4","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Skrypec","documentHash":"89eed111-74b9-4811-8dce-8384f43e692f"},{"objectId":"6660300440970740074edaa2","name":"Lydia","lastName":"Tasenkevich","documentHash":"e62a0793-c1ac-4d23-875a-78f4310571fd"},{"objectId":"609badcb9543c73526c48ddc","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Walas","uuid":"E1487E209BFE1859BC19AE81536E570F7441462D7640828646C2A178167548E2FAB950B628D6E3175BF4B9F287E730921BE7B613AC07554C874A38EDD7300CA8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4060-9801","documentHash":"3b7fa0ae-0321-4b2a-ad87-b43027d64501"},{"objectId":"5e709220878c28a04739043a","name":"Adam","lastName":"Boratyński","uuid":"B0B03283D6CD0A2483E483DF54B2872CAC4B1F82B2723E380207785BE26440C9A74868B77350B395688A8368FC4DD29D9D9C1FD57517CF434EBD66D019C28DD2","orcidId":"0000-0003-0678-4304","documentHash":"bf363418-5bc5-4af2-a83e-368067a1237c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":0,"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"6660300440970740074edaa1","doi":"10.12657/denbio.089.001","publicUri":"https://www.idpan.poznan.pl/images/stories/dendrobiology/vol89/denbio089001.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Biodiversity of high-mountain woody plants in the East Carpathians in Ukraine","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The highest parts of the European mountain massifs are covered by subalpine and alpine vegetation, with rich flora containing many relic woody plants adapted to cold temperatures and relatively short vegetation periods. In the Ukrainian Carpathians, only several highest mountain massifs form environmental conditions suitable for high mountain plants. The aim of the study was the detection of the centre of biodiversity of the high mountain plants in the East Carpathians in Ukraine. We expected the largest number of high mountain woody species in the Ukrainian East Carpathians would occur in the Chornohora, the largest and most elevated mountain chain in the country. To solve this problem, the geographic distribution of 16 woody species was analysed cartographically. We gathered georeferenced data of 919 localities of taxa, which occur in the subalpine and alpine vegetation belts, and prepared maps of their distribution using QGIS software. Additionally, we analysed vertical distribution and occurrence on different expositions of every taxon. Most of analysed subalpine and alpine species occur in the highest and the largest mountain massifs. The high mountain woody species occur in the Ukrainian parts of the East Carpathians mainly in the largest mountain massifs, the Chornohora, Svydovets, Chyvchyny, Marmarosh, and to a lesser extent, also in the Gorgany. The vertical distribution and predominant occurrence on the northern or close to northern expositions of most subalpine and alpine species indicate their demands for the relatively high level of humidity of the soil and high level of precipitation. These condition point to the relic character of most of analysed species, which origin from the glacial periods of the Pleistocene. Most of the taxa, which have centres of their distribution in the alpine and sub-alpine vegetation belts of the East Carpathians in the Ukraine territory are valuable but threatened elements of the Ukrainian flora."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["609badcb9543c73526c48ddc","5e709220878c28a04739043a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"89","pagesFromTo":"1-19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6660300440970740074edaa2","5e709220878c28a04739043a","6660300440970740074edaa4","6660300440970740074edaa5","6660300440970740074edaa6","609badcb9543c73526c48ddc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547790b","mniswId":"4926","title":"Dendrobiology","issn":"1641-1307","eissn":"2083-8387","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"ce7d89a5-6164-4916-a543-a236ef8ec26b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"642fe6b44097074b64683a67","year":"2023","volume":"89","documentHash":"6675ec56-fcb8-45bb-8a95-b220cf2ef5ac"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["arctic-alpine plants,","alpine plants,","subalpine plants,","East Carpathians,","phytogeography"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059631751"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"617768287523400564d3afcd","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Szczepański","uuid":"095E8B7504E2EFC8B70CB7AF58AC46F74E0D7EE5BE180DED3DCBAB9C6BF3220A052028B2BD40E96D6A61D515D2189E4DC69B4E35C868EF01B8BDB49FC4802E04","orcidId":"0000-0001-9701-0771","documentHash":"05fd6af2-40cd-42cd-9424-3b9b8d13c56a"},{"objectId":"602b9e399543c7410626dee8","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Łabiszak","uuid":"FF5814130838497694430AF40D67B1138FF735082AF683EB781739251180DDFC8B5ECFE8A89566B7CF3ED19564E041EADF4CC6024F20E6178B0FEB2EB7734F8C","orcidId":"0000-0002-2548-9186","documentHash":"2d266f59-4928-4f8b-9f49-41fca4e9d45c"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394a4b","name":"Witold","lastName":"Wachowiak","uuid":"C26062D41DB33086B107BD526D6E2C9E3C8088D15F5B546A988D1C4503B9F46279C01A5B4CE21F5984C4BFB3036F365FD93F5AC4F16088627CCD320179599AEC","orcidId":"0000-0003-2898-3523","documentHash":"e85235e3-e1b0-48e3-88ea-772ee8162970"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2023-09-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"666028ec40970740074df9b8","doi":"10.12657/denbio.090.006","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Development of a SNaPshot assay for the genotyping of organellar SNPs in four closely related pines","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Mitochondrial (mtDNA) and chloroplast (cpDNA) polymorphisms are valuable resources to study past demographic changes, phylogenetics and evolution, especially in forest tree species, where these genomes are haploid and uniparentally transferred. The organellar markers were usually scored separately using direct sequencing or PCR-based approaches, which can be time-consuming and expensive, especially in large-scale population genetics research. In this study, we developed an efficient and cost-effective SNaPshot assay for genotyping preselected ­mtDNA and cpDNA polymorphism in four closely related pine species including Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and three taxa from the Pinus mugo complex. We validated the method by genotyping the samples derived from 12 populations of the species from their wide geographical distribution range in Europe. The results proved high accuracy of the method with a genotyping success rate of 99.7%. The set of assayed markers shows significant genetic variation. By using multiplex SNaPshot assay, we provided an efficient and sensitive molecular tool for intra- and interspecific genetic analyses. The presented protocol is useful for fast and relatively cheap SNP genotyping of organelle genome of closely related pine species. The assayed SNPs allow studying the species discrimination and detailed investigations of their population history and structure.

Nevertheless, how N and P additions would change arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal community and functional guilds in forest soil remains largely unclear.Materials and methodsA 5-year N and P addition experiment was conducted in a subtropical forest of southeastern China. Soil AM fungal communities were detected by the high throughput sequencing of 18S rRNA gene-fragments. We investigated the six-seasonal responses of AM fungal diversity, community assembly pattern and functional guild composition to N and/or P amendments.Results and discussionThe AM fungal Shannon index changed from a positive (3-4 years) to a nonsignificant (4-5 years) effect under P and NP additions as the duration of fertilization increased. P addition, but not N addition, changed the AM fungal community assembly pattern from stochastic- to deterministic-dominant processes. In contrast, P and NP additions significantly influenced AM fungal functional guild components, and the relative abundances of ancestral and edaphophilic guilds increased with increasing years of fertilization. Additionally, the AM fungal guild structure was significantly affected by soil P-related parameters.ConclusionsOur results emphasize the substantial impacts of P amendment on soil AM community assembly pattern and functional guild composition. This study contributes to a better understanding of the temporal dynamics and potential ecological functioning of AM fungi under global environmental changes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61d6623975234056c07ce8fd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"2700-2711","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6661882f409707458fb45be8","6661882f409707458fb45be9","6661882f409707458fb45bea","6661882f409707458fb45beb","6661882f409707458fb45bec","6661882f409707458fb45bed","61d6623975234056c07ce8fd","6661882f409707458fb45bef","6661882f409707458fb45bf0","6661882f409707458fb45bf1","6661882f409707458fb45bf2","6661882f409707458fb45bf3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478a87","mniswId":"12669","title":"Journal of Soils and Sediments","issn":"1439-0108","eissn":"1614-7480","websiteLink":"http://link.springer.com/journal/11368","documentHash":"34ef33c5-c2a0-49c6-bdbb-1688868cc90b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6661882f409707458fb45be7","year":"2023","volume":"23","number":"7","documentHash":"3f86d3e8-3b3c-4e7d-b7b2-d2d726b11d69"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["AM fungal guild,","Community assembly,","Diversity,","Nitrogen deposition,","Nutrient availability,","Phosphorus addition"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059631992"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66619320409707458fb5c156","name":"Shahina","lastName":"Akter","documentHash":"dec5c820-2e86-4e6c-93fb-6be61728a1c8"},{"objectId":"66619320409707458fb5c155","name":"Jong-Hyun","lastName":"Park","documentHash":"b729e967-cef5-4da6-8d4a-ca7d9d5392f9"},{"objectId":"66619320409707458fb5c154","name":"Kihong","lastName":"NAM","documentHash":"f2094a5f-f02a-402c-a359-9492c5732bf6"},{"objectId":"66619320409707458fb5c153","name":"Fahadul","lastName":"Islam","documentHash":"1482e8c4-c3ff-4369-92d2-cca43a1c7c51"},{"objectId":"66619320409707458fb5c151","name":"Md.","lastName":"Abuhena","documentHash":"f9cabfba-3553-415a-8532-63a2c67e39b8"},{"objectId":"66619320409707458fb5c150","name":"Masoumeh","lastName":"Naserkheil","documentHash":"462f3aa7-75f2-415b-8b32-30cd041c863b"},{"objectId":"66619320409707458fb5c14f","name":"M.

About two-thirds of all known truffle records originate from Europe. Historically, the Mediterranean region in Southern Europe is associated with truffle cultivation and it is widely regarded as a center of truffle distribution in Europe. On the contrary, little is known about truffles in the central and northern regions of Europe. Here, native truffle species in Poland, their symbiotic ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree partners, and their continental-scale distribution were studied. Altogether, 16 truffle species were identified based on the sequences of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) rDNA, a barcode region for fungi. Truffle species were associated with deciduous tree species of Fagales (Fagaceae, Betulaceae, Juglandaceae), Malvales (Malvaceae), Malpighiales (Salicaceae), and coniferous trees of Pinales (Pinaceae). Fagales trees constituted 70% of ECM associations formed by truffle species. Three genera of the order Fagales, Quercus, Fagus, and Corylus formed 50% of all ECM associations. Coniferous trees of Pinales formed 16% of associations. Two other orders of deciduous trees, Malvales and Malpighiales, together formed 14% of ECM associations. All but three identified truffle species exhibited low specificity to their ECM tree partners. Two-thirds of truffle species formed ECM symbiosis with both coniferous and deciduous tree species, but the share of coniferous tree partners was considerably lower than that of deciduous trees, reaching up to 30% for T. anniae, T. puberulum, and T. borchii (clade/puberulum). All the identified truffles were noted in both Central Europe and the Mediterranean region. Among them, about 80% of truffle species were widely distributed across the continent and represented by similar or higher numbers of records in Northern Europe, i.e., above the 48th parallel north, than in Southern Europe. This study showed higher taxa richness of native truffle species in Poland, but low specificity to their ECM tree partners. However, further studies on the regional-scale distribution of truffles in Poland are needed to improve the knowledge of the patterns of truffle distribution in forest ecosystems and the potential productivity of edible truffle species with high economic value."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e4878c28a0473b2bfd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"2407","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093e4878c28a0473b2bfd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d36","mniswId":"6744","title":"Forests","issn":"1999-4907","eissn":"1999-4907","documentHash":"05b7b2b7-d675-43a7-91dd-8446464e53a5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66617287409707458fb16d54","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"12","documentHash":"0c91d84e-1645-4c69-a9e9-cf7350554485"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ectomycorrhiza,","symbiosis,","forest ecosystems,","phylogeny,","Tuberaceae,","truffles"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059632134"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6661920a409707458fb59ef6","name":"Zoriana","lastName":"Polishchuk","documentHash":"b6a5c806-aa88-41d2-93b7-8fbfa952c7f8"},{"objectId":"6661920a409707458fb59ef5","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Grabovska","documentHash":"788f1d34-be96-453f-bb17-351477e0ff08"},{"objectId":"6661920a409707458fb59ef3","name":"Vitaliy","lastName":"Lavrov","documentHash":"232cbc4e-72ab-4a58-a6e1-c94cefd12595"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c99a","name":"Olena","lastName":"Blinkova","uuid":"FCDEFDDB4D14DBD4366DEC01A9C71A869C7AE5C63D668B4195800610DCBF8557CACE09DBD841E8F41FEB0C80B1772C8CBD2E3945DC29C87B1E36238EE18B9ABB","documentHash":"aa979829-0aaf-4a99-834c-50fe4b89c463"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6661920a409707458fb59ef2","doi":"10.2478/ffp-2023-0004","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/ffp-2023-0004","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Evaluation of forest ecosystems’ anthropogenic transformation by indicators of xylomycocomplex","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of our work was to establish the dependence of species composition, features of ecosystem distribution in the space and wood-destroying activity of xylotrophs on the functional type of forest, and the cause and degree of its violation.

The waxy coating on the leaves and the phenolic compounds takes a long time to break down under normal conditions. It is necessary to explore various fungi that can degrade these leaves for an eco-friendly solution to this problem. In this study, spores of nine native Trichoderma strains were produced on wheat agar using a lactic acid-induced sporulation strategy (LAISS). Trichoderma biosustained spores and Serendipita indica (SI) spores were applied to a rice field with accumulated Eucalyptus leaves under continuous ponding (CP) and alternate flooding and wetting conditions (AFW). Among the strains, TI04 (Trichoderma viride) and TI15 (Trichoderma citrinoviride) showed faster (5 days) and assive sporulation (1.06-1.38 x 10(11) CFU/g) in LAISS. In vitro, TI04 and TI15 biosustained on Eucalyptus leaves and improved rice seedling growth and SI infection under greenhouse conditions. In the rice-field experiment, Trichoderma-treatment had a threefold yield (percentage) increase from control, with TI04 (CP) increasing the yield by 30.79, TI04 (AFW) by 29.45, TI15 (CP) by 32.72, and TI15 (AFW) rising by 31.91. Remarkably, unfilled grain yield significantly decreased in all the Trichoderma treatments. Under AFW conditions, TI04 and TI15 showed a higher pH increase. Furthermore, TI04 and TI15 under AFW had higher water productivity (t ha(-1) cm(-1)) of 0.0763 and 0.0791, respectively, and the highest rates (percentage) of SI olonization of 86.36 and 83.16, respectively. According to the findings, LAISS-produced Trichoderma spores can be applied to break down persistent wastes and restore agricultural ecosystems through increased mycorrhizae networking."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61d6623975234056c07ce8fd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1071392","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6661aebf409707458fbab92d","6661aebf409707458fbab92e","6661aebf409707458fbab92f","6661aebf409707458fbab930","6661aebf409707458fbab931","6661aebf409707458fbab932","6661aebf409707458fbab933","61d6623975234056c07ce8fd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d5f","mniswId":"6848","title":"Frontiers in Microbiology","doi":"","issn":"1664-302X","eissn":"1664-302X","websiteLink":"http://www.frontiersin.org/Microbiology","documentHash":"deb1269d-858f-44fd-b8a6-ceb480f729b8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c7fac24097076eb37d4388","year":"2023","volume":"13","documentHash":"c5042819-6133-4361-8f2b-8216e5c8da85"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Trichoderma spp,","Serendipita indica,","Eucalyptus,","rice,","ecosystem hazards"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059638059"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473beab2","name":"Artur","lastName":"Dyczko","uuid":"89A90BE47B33188D72DB120229F0AE2C512AD3DB49FD20F72D1289B9B588FD8E2A6695AC68B5BBF649805E854CCBB468E5293795B66F3D7DCDBBE1847C091DB5","orcidId":"0000-0001-6387-5339","documentHash":"b2f0ab36-c883-406b-9a40-d89bfdd66da9"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"03F14E2076FEABB44CC7B743F6FD9B59C0B3CE3F788CFE10E84226C037F019164ED6EE4E61A04DD072E5640611915200DC9689ED62B57A29F869C4D59C6D63FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-0985","documentHash":"002defbf-325a-404d-a301-7cc974eec233"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0e37","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Hutniczak","uuid":"548C3BAEACE3DEA6306AAD8065F8A368CA4F5F3374FCC35EA081F0C7E32DD6DC126918C21D85909D51D0120A1F427FF4CE37DEFBE65AD5EB5BE320D76C45AAFA","documentHash":"23296815-6076-48f2-8989-80ab92682391"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f022","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"2D9FBD547ED5A35CF5E1E8D2C5DD7679C3C0131E7732BE3AC783A27D55AC85FF0DA6826E6609ED403B95EF9697D29BDBD2B4621647DA0B5DEB0701E6C4E2184A","orcidId":"0000-0003-1936-2880","documentHash":"9db4886c-beb8-4af7-a752-7933a8390aa4"},{"objectId":"5e7091fd878c28a04738e383","name":"Damian","lastName":"Chmura","uuid":"40D57366F77EBE6B8A6B9FA079F5BDDFB81A0DE2A090DF464A85057A85B4AD63166B4C85D53A5378F9856A3F70169E98CDC9F5D548B5061F626FB952872E8B84","orcidId":"0000-0002-0242-8962","documentHash":"eb66a521-8719-43f9-9d7d-1cd07573c2bd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"6315cf5a40970717dcf81eb0","doi":"10.3390/su141710829","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/17/10829","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Novel ecosystems in the urban - industrial landscape - interesting aspects of environmental knowledge requiring broadening : a review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Human activity is affecting and transforming the natural environment, changing the ecosystem mosaic and natural biogeochemical processes in urban-industrial landscapes. Among the anthropogenic ecosystems, there are many present features of Novel Ecosystems (NE), e.g., the de novo created habitats on post-mineral excavation sites. The biological nature of the functional mechanisms of Novel Ecosystems is mostly unknown. In natural and semi-natural ecosystems, biodiversity is considered as the primary element influencing ecosystem processes and functioning. The preliminary studies conducted on post-mineral excavation sites have shown that, in poor oligotrophic habitats, the species composition of the assembled vascular plants is non-analogous, distinctive, and not found in natural and semi-natural habitats. This paper aims to present the gaps between scientific identification of the biological mechanisms driving ecosystem processes and functioning (including the expanding areas of Novel Ecosystems created de novo). Among the identified gaps, the following issues should be listed. The detailed identification and understanding of the processes and biodiversity-dependent functioning of Novel Ecosystems is crucial for proper environmental management, particularly when facing the challenges of ecological constraints and of global change. The ecology of Novel Ecosystems is a social and economic issue because of the relationships with densely populated urban-industrial

beech forests: Thinning and ground-based skidding are found to alter microarthropod biodiversity with no effect on litter decomposition rate","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Despite the high ecological value of Mediterranean beech forests, very little is known about the implications of forest operations on soil microarthropod biodiversity and litter decomposition rate. There is also no information concerning the amount of time needed for disturbed forest soil to recover and return to the pre-harvesting conditions. Silvicultural treatments are scheduled about every ten to fifteen years, without taking into account the amount of time necessary for recovery. The purpose of this study was to determine this information. The study started by selecting three study sites located along the Italian Apennine, each including a chronosequence of three forest parcels: one harvested in 2021, one harvested in 2012, and a control parcel which had not been harvested within the last forty years. In the harvested parcels we investigated skid trails which are classified as disturbed, and soil not affected by the passage of a machine which is classified as undisturbed. Thus in each study area there were five experimental treatments including the control area. The soil physico-chemical properties were assessed for each treatment. These included bulk density, penetration resistance, shear resistance, organic matter content, and soil microarthropod biodiversity which was assessed by the QBS-ar index (Soil Biological Quality based on microarthropods, a qualitative index measuring the quality of soil according to the biodiversity of the microarthropod community). We further established a litter decomposition experiment, using teabags as reference material, to check the differences among treatments in litter decomposition rates. We used linear mixed-effects models to investigate the effects of the experimental treatment on the physico-chemical and biological features, and relationships among QBS-ar index and soil physico-chemical features. We analysed the effects of the experimental treatment on the litter decomposition rate using generalised linear-mixed effects models. A significant effect caused by machine passage was found in the recently harvested parcels on soil penetration resistance ( +70 % comparing to the control), shear resistance ( +35 %), and QBS-ar index (-25 %). Effects of machine passage on soil bulk density and organic matter content were not significant. All the investigated variables in the skid trails returned to values similar to those recorded in the control after ten years. We did not find effects of any soil physico-chemical features on QBS-ar index. Finally, no effect of the experimental treatment was found on the litter decomposition rate, suggesting that a stronger magnitude of soil disturbance is needed to affect this complex biogeochemical process. Although the initial impact was highly significant, it was found that a 10-year period is sufficient for recovering the investigated soil features in the upper soil layer. This was observed in Mediterranean beech forests when forest operations were done with lowweight machines and a limited number of machine passes on the skid trails. Thus, it can be concluded that planning another operation 10-15 years after the previous thinning, as is currently done, remains in line with the time needed for the forest soil to recover."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","5e709499878c28a0473c026c","62c796a8752340480571c999"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"569","pagesFromTo":"122160","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c796a8752340480571c999","5e709499878c28a0473c026c","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","66a37f7cfdbe836c5d8adb59","66a37f7cfdbe836c5d8adb5a","66a37f7cfdbe836c5d8adb5b","66a37f7cfdbe836c5d8adb5c","5e709346878c28a0473a62d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d2e","mniswId":"6734","title":"FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","issn":"0378-1127","documentHash":"37771705-8204-4376-a5d9-e8d43ad82b3e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66a37f7cfdbe836c5d8adb55","year":"2024","volume":"569","documentHash":"b329532f-64c6-4655-b01f-8da78cf4dfcd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sustainable forest operations,","Timber harvesting,","Shelterwood method,","QBS-ar index"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060537581"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67adff92fdbe83445187ad03","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Zieliński","documentHash":"c0937951-6f17-423d-b519-26fe27c2ac8b"},{"objectId":"67adff92fdbe83445187ad02","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Wrońska-Pilarek","documentHash":"c12eeeb7-cd41-4e3e-86ea-a08fcf35a5fb"},{"objectId":"67adff92fdbe83445187ad01","name":"Kacper","lastName":"Woźniak","documentHash":"18165927-bfef-4df5-acf1-8f581dc88c28"},{"objectId":"67adff92fdbe83445187ad00","name":"Zenon","lastName":"Pilarek","documentHash":"e9b828ca-88f2-4676-8082-7d62324436d8"},{"objectId":"67adff92fdbe83445187acff","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Maliński","documentHash":"ce581402-c88c-4004-a249-6ee4e1a91b7e"},{"objectId":"67adff92fdbe83445187acfe","name":"Anna K.","lastName":"Jasińska","documentHash":"d18e79f6-b8af-45f8-9f8a-22f014ecea36"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c026c","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Horodecki","uuid":"7F70C73730CEB5DD7E6741FECB12A65A529DDB966478C8334018A31EFF9EC4C7D25A06154BC87F2F9E8D4FFB6D9B1E6C8CFDD4614F20DCAAABA7EBDD573645DB","orcidId":"0000-0002-7789-8723","documentHash":"4e3b185a-8e56-4c89-b7ea-a9b8d334f566"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"03F14E2076FEABB44CC7B743F6FD9B59C0B3CE3F788CFE10E84226C037F019164ED6EE4E61A04DD072E5640611915200DC9689ED62B57A29F869C4D59C6D63FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-0985","documentHash":"002defbf-325a-404d-a301-7cc974eec233"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ec","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Dyderski","uuid":"BA6020477E5CC315EB2E63B48E152FE36A33E8B3703BEC4812CECBFB0E0E652860C4E0E44BFA87F2AF6998A9580D130FEA7048AFDF4D7E950BC02A1F7F9A3632","orcidId":"0000-0003-4453-2781","documentHash":"6a027753-5078-4ffd-bbdc-95bb2c2a4c00"}],"objectId":"67adff92fdbe83445187acfb","doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2024.122147","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0378112724004596?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Invasive × Sorbaronia fallax nothosubsp. mitschurinii affects temperate Scots pine forest biodiversity and functioning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Invasive species affect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but their impacts along the abundance gradient has been insufficiently recognized. Here we aimed to assess the impacts of invasive x Sorbaronia fallax nothosubsp. mitschurinii (hereafter x Sorbaronia ) spread into temperate Scots pine forests on understory vegetation biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We hypothesized that x Sorbaronia will affect light transmittance into the forest floor, chemical composition of soil and litter, stand and litter production, and understory vegetation. We assessed the set of experimental plots along the invasion gradient in homogenous soil conditions in Western Poland. Around the initial propagule source (abandoned plantation) we established 66 study plots in a systematic design. Using generalized linear mixed-effects models and redundancy analysis we assessed the response of studied predictors to x Sorbaronia biomass. We showed that the studied taxon decreased light transmittance as well as understory cover and species richness of vascular plants. We also confirmed an increase in soil P and litter P, K, and Ca contents. Therefore x Sorbaronia modified the biogeochemical cycles of temperate Scots pine forests. We did not find an effect of the studied taxon on carbon sequestration, due to no impacts on the litter and soil C pools, or on stand productivity. Revealed impacts are scalable with invasive taxon abundance, expressed as aboveground biomass. The impacts of x Sorbaronia are similar to the impacts of the functionally and phylogenetically close widespread invasive species. The studied taxon has a high potential to negatively affect biodiversity and alter the functioning of temperate Scots pine forests, fulfilling the criteria of 'transformers ' as an invasive taxon.

In the longer term, however, evolutionary adaptation would be needed for populations to thrive in the changed climate, or species may migrate to new areas as climate becomes favorable there. European beech is one of the most important tree species in western and central Europe, and projections indicate that it may contract its southern range and migrate towards northern and north-eastern Europe in the future climates. It is therefore important to recognize the level of variation in climatic adaptation and climatic responsiveness of populations which are likely the source of genetic material for expanding the species range. In this study we examined variation in growth and productivity among 39 European beech populations, which represent the north-eastern margin of the species distribution range. We employed the transfer function and the Universal Response Function approaches to analyze populations' performance in response to the climatic transfer across five provenance test sites and in relationship to climate at the populations' origin and planting sites. We found significant but low variation among tested populations in tree diameter (DBH; cm) and Volume index (m(3) ha(-1)) and significant population x site interaction at age 30 years. That variation, however, was only weakly related to gradients of climatic variables represented by the set of sampled populations. The variable performance of populations across planting sites, and the importance of planting sites' climate in explaining traits' variation in this experiment confirm the plastic response of examined populations to climate change. Our findings indicate that beech populations from the analyzed region have a high acclimation potential to the projected changes in climate, although for high-altitude populations (from > 600 m a.s.l) the negative effect of transfers to warmer and drier conditions was observed. Detailed knowledge of the plasticity of response and adaptive potential of marginal beech populations in the longer term would be needed to guide management decisions to help future forests to cope with climate change."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","uid":"bk6a4u9UDD_o3fTovGAeczg","uuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","name":"Instytut Badawczy Leśnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d0878c28a04739d3df","5ebee6aa752340254fc44fa5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","parentUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","rootUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70925f878c28a0473948ba"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e088","uid":"bUmj6ITUzeAJhYNJMxX1S8w","uuid":"110407bb-e91f-453a-9532-fed2f55572bc","name":"Wydział Leśny","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709304878c28a0473a1215","5e709304878c28a0473a1231"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"565","pagesFromTo":"122043","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70925f878c28a0473948ba","5e709304878c28a0473a1215","5e709304878c28a0473a1231","5e7092d0878c28a04739d3df","5ebee6aa752340254fc44fa5","668e71e1fdbe8379d90948fc","668e71e1fdbe8379d90948fd","668e71e1fdbe8379d90948fe"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d2e","mniswId":"6734","title":"FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","issn":"0378-1127","documentHash":"37771705-8204-4376-a5d9-e8d43ad82b3e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"668e71e1fdbe8379d90948f8","year":"2024","volume":"565","documentHash":"29697ad3-d77b-4e24-a7f8-e2ad82149dab"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Adaptation,","Climate change,","Fagus sylvatica,","Phenotypic plasticity,","Provenance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061001884"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656d9637409707185519c491","name":"Hynek","lastName":"Roubik","documentHash":"143171e2-4bfc-4d67-93cc-135afb61ed3d"},{"objectId":"656d9637409707185519c490","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Grabovska","documentHash":"6020f4c8-fdb8-471d-b2b1-09c741344986"},{"objectId":"656d9637409707185519c48f","name":"Yulia","lastName":"Havrylnuk","documentHash":"4ffae825-1a19-41a2-98ee-d3b91689c06d"},{"objectId":"656d9637409707185519c48e","name":"Liudmila","lastName":"Raichuk","documentHash":"dbcb1452-95b3-419d-959c-4bac15a7b869"},{"objectId":"656d9637409707185519c48d","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Makarenko","documentHash":"4a2dfdfa-c2e6-4e75-be86-23bdda5d6677"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c99a","name":"Olena","lastName":"Blinkova","uuid":"FCDEFDDB4D14DBD4366DEC01A9C71A869C7AE5C63D668B4195800610DCBF8557CACE09DBD841E8F41FEB0C80B1772C8CBD2E3945DC29C87B1E36238EE18B9ABB","documentHash":"aa979829-0aaf-4a99-834c-50fe4b89c463"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"656d9637409707185519c48b","doi":"10.12775/eq.2023.011","publicUri":"https://apcz.umk.pl/EQ/article/download/38796/33844","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Invasion of Parthenocissus quinquefolia (L.)

The results showed that P. quinquefolia has a wide range of values of edaphic and climatic factors. The populations of P. quinquefolia differ according to the degree of anthropogenic transformation of the ecotope, the ecological conditions formed, and the allocation of coenotics. The biomorphological characteristics of the species variability are shown on the gradient of anthropogenic transformation. Diagnostic parameters of P. quinquefolia under the conditions of anthropogenic transformation are the number of crotches of the tendrils and the length of the tendrils. The number of flowers per plant is characterized by the highest level of variation and belongs to the V class of variability. The smallest plasticity is characterized by the diameter of the stem. Vitality analysis indicated that cenopopulations of P. quinquefolia belong to the equilibria or prosperous population types, regardless of the intensity of the anthropogenic factor."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c99a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"34","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"35-44","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c796a8752340480571c99a","656d9637409707185519c48d","656d9637409707185519c48e","656d9637409707185519c48f","656d9637409707185519c490","656d9637409707185519c491"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db7","mniswId":"22105","title":"Ecological Questions","issn":"1644-7298","eissn":"2083-5469","documentHash":"b6965847-4981-4a35-8c5e-433260243ede"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656d9637409707185519c48c","year":"2022","volume":"34","number":"1","documentHash":"0014496c-fa98-4dc7-9586-eeef16b5df8d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["anthropophyte,","ecological factors,","biomorphology,","variability,","adaptation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654896849"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6641bdc640970755576c4bf1","name":"Antelmo Ralph","lastName":"Falqueto","documentHash":"bbc2d0ed-8355-40f1-9f4a-3e516f8535c6"},{"objectId":"6641bdc640970755576c4bf0","name":"Daniela","lastName":"Cassol","documentHash":"8b68b235-0263-4e68-ab3a-e530414b243f"},{"objectId":"6641bdc640970755576c4bef","name":"Mônica Maria Pereira","lastName":"Tognella","documentHash":"63c5307f-bd36-4a9b-9f97-f60d4122f324"},{"objectId":"6641bdc640970755576c4bee","name":"Diolina Moura","lastName":"Silva","documentHash":"199a8e59-dca5-4a79-8a4d-1fab48c48859"},{"objectId":"6641bdc640970755576c4bec","name":"Vinícius Fonseca dos","lastName":"Santos","documentHash":"592492ae-8145-4bf1-b342-3c3de65b26f5"},{"objectId":"6641bdc640970755576c4beb","name":"Marcel Merlo","lastName":"Mendes","documentHash":"2dc14d57-229e-4f9d-bcb9-1b29bf9862bf"},{"objectId":"6641bdc640970755576c4bea","name":"Jadson Bonini","lastName":"Zampirollo","documentHash":"3ea5d3cd-569a-4c2c-8fa0-0914500cfbd8"},{"objectId":"6641bdc640970755576c4be9","name":"Clodoaldo Leites","lastName":"Pinheiro","documentHash":"fe771743-d732-4e25-9ad9-e9ca94453b7e"},{"objectId":"648d1aa940e3ff055afbad3c","name":"Joao Paulo","lastName":"Rodrigues Martins","uuid":"2968C57B9DEB71FCFD39AD3B6BB061A51E46188FEF23BDF1C0528AEC174302FFF2464F76E23995A4DC98B5C64444ADE44E83E97025064F549073629D483DE31F","orcidId":"0000-0003-0554-6793","documentHash":"d5ef666c-de67-4c69-9e2f-205aca2d5ade"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"6641bdc640970755576c4be7","doi":"10.1590/2447-536x.v29i1.2527","publicUri":"http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_pdf&pid=S2447-536X2023000100057&tlng=en","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Exposition of three Cattleya species (Orchidaceae) to full sunlight: effect on their physiological plasticity and response to changes in light conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In order to establish a link between the evolutionary history and the photochemical attributes, measurements of chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence were made in Cattleya warneri, C.  shofleldiana and C. harrisoniana exposed to high irradiance for 5, 35, and 120 min (hereafter referred to as treatments T5, T35, and T120, respectively). The following questions are addressed: (1) Is the increased energy dissipation enough to counterbalance the excess energy that drives photosynthesis at different times of high irradiance exposure? (2) Is there an influence of the incidence and duration of light radiation on Cattleya species in full sunlight, compared to Cattleya species submitted to low irradiance? Higher relative variable fluorescence at the  J-step (Vj) values  followed by  the lower quantum  yield of electron  transport (ψEo) indicate the accumulation of reduced Quinone A (QA) proportionally of sunflecks exposure time in C. warneri. The higher performance index (PIABS) and plasticity index values in C. schofleldiana indicate higher efflciency  in modulating the photosynthetic apparatus under sunflecks. C. harrisoniana shows the lowest plasticity index, suppression of maximum fluorescence (Fm), and no recovery of PIABS after sunflecks. This study evidences the importance of physiological plasticity in the current geographic distribution of Cattleya in response to light pulses in species derived from fragmented habitats and the maintenance of shade to species of more primitive clades."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","uid":"b3yLJedL7ndyw_0B5zyovVA","uuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","name":"Instytut Dendrologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["648d1aa940e3ff055afbad3c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","parentUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea1","rootUuid":"3a2aa747-ec4d-4290-b48f-5f0423f0c55e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"57-67","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6641bdc640970755576c4be9","6641bdc640970755576c4bea","6641bdc640970755576c4beb","6641bdc640970755576c4bec","648d1aa940e3ff055afbad3c","6641bdc640970755576c4bee","6641bdc640970755576c4bef","6641bdc640970755576c4bf0","6641bdc640970755576c4bf1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547e6be","mniswId":"25389","title":"Ornamental Horticulture","eissn":"2447-536X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"6565bed3-455c-4c18-83e9-dafcf8bf3f96"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6641bdc640970755576c4be8","year":"2023","volume":"29","number":"1","documentHash":"60990108-e499-40a6-b5c7-39c91c480509"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Chlorophyll a fluorescence","orchids","sunflecks"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654968596"}]
