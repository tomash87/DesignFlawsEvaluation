Methods: We retrospectively included 501 consecutive patients who underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor and were diagnosed with primary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder between January 2013 and February 2021 in a university hospital. The type of diagnosis (incidental or nonincidental), patient baseline characteristics and primary stage and grade were studied for interdependencies. Results: 28.5% of all patients and 19.8% of high grade (HG) BC patients had been diagnosed incidentally, most commonly with ultrasound. Incidental diagnosis was associated with lower primary stage and grade of the disease. Most importantly, on multivariable analysis, which included baseline patient characteristics and type of diagnosis, in the subgroup of HG BC patients, muscle-invasive BC (MIBC) or metastatic disease was three times less likely to be diagnosed incidentally than non-MIBC (odds ratio: 0.31, 95% confidence interval: 0.14–0.71, p = 0.006). Conclusions: The study is first to demonstrate that incidental diagnosis of HG BC may be surprisingly prevalent and associated with lower rates of muscle invasion or metastatic disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709429878c28a0473b7610"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

The nanocoating based on polyethyleneimine (PEI) or polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) with metallic nanoparticles incorporated was investigated using the AFM technique. Moreover, the functioning of human lung cells in a configuration with the prepared material with the adsorbed coronavirus was studied using microscopic techniques and flow cytometry. The mean values of the percentage share of viable cells compared with the control differed by a maximum of 22%. The results showed that PEI and PSS membrane layer coatings, modified with chosen metallic nanoparticles (AuNPs, AgNPs, CuNPs, FeNPs) that absorb COV, could support lung cells’ function, despite the different distribution patterns of COV on designed surfaces as well as immobilized lung cells.

In recent years, it has become clear that the achievements of nanotechnology have introduced a new quality in wound healing. The application of nanomaterials in wound dressing significantly improves their properties and promotes the healing of injuries. Therefore, this review paper presents the subjectively selected nanomaterials used in wound dressings, including the metallic nanoparticles (NPs), and refers to the aspects of their application as antimicrobial factors. The literature review was supplemented with the results of our team’s research on the elements of multifunctional new-generation dressings containing nanoparticles. The wound healing multiple molecular pathways, mediating cell types, and affecting agents are discussed herein. Moreover, the categorization of wound dressings is presented. Additionally, some materials and membrane constructs applied in wound dressings are described. Finally, bacterial participation in wound healing and the mechanism of the antibacterial function of nanoparticles are considered. Membranes involving NPs as the bacteriostatic factors for improving wound healing of skin and bones, including our experimental findings, are discussed in the paper. In addition, some studies of our team concerning the selected bacterial strains’ interaction with material involving different metallic NPs, such as AuNPs, AgNPs, Fe3O4NPs, and CuNPs, are presented. Furthermore, nanoparticles’ influence on selected eukaryotic cells is mentioned. The ideal, universal wound dressing still has not been obtained; thus, a new generation of products have been developed, represented by the nanocomposite materials with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory properties that can influence the wound-healing process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

In this study, we fitted a range of differential equation models to tumor volume measurements of patients undergoing chemotherapy or cancer immunotherapy for solid tumors. We used a large dataset of 1472 patients with three or more measurements per target lesion, of which 652 patients had six or more data points. We show that the early treatment response shows only moderate correlation with the final treatment response, demonstrating the need for nuanced models. We then perform a head-to-head comparison of six classical models which are widely used in the field: the Exponential, Logistic, Classic Bertalanffy, General Bertalanffy, Classic Gompertz and General Gompertz model. Several models provide a good fit to tumor volume measurements, with the Gompertz model providing the best balance between goodness of fit and number of parameters. Similarly, when fitting to early treatment data, the general Bertalanffy and Gompertz models yield the lowest mean absolute error to forecasted data, indicating that these models could potentially be effective at predicting treatment outcome. In summary, we provide a quantitative benchmark for classical textbook models and state-of-the art models of human tumor growth. We publicly release an anonymized version of our original data, providing the first benchmark set of human tumor growth data for evaluation of mathematical models."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

influence on overall survival (OS) rates in melanoma. Based on data from 249 patients with metastatic melanoma and a normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) at baseline, we found that during anti-PD-1 therapy, 95 patients had a TSH outside normal ranges (32 had clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism). The 3-year OS rates in patients with clinical hypothyroidism, abnormal but clinically not significant TSH, and euthyreosis were 56%, 43%, and 32%, respectively. After adjusting the Cox model for potential confounding variables, clinically significant hypothyroidism was an independent prognostic factor with HR 0.51 (95% CI 0.29–0.87).\nAbstract\nAntibodies against programmed cell death protein-1 or its ligand (PD-(L)1) are a standard of care in melanoma; however, this treatment may cause immune-related adverse events. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune-related thyroid adverse events (irTAEs) during anti-PD-1 therapy and analyze their influence on the overall survival rates in melanoma. We included 249 patients with metastatic melanoma treated in our institution between 2014 and 2021; the median age was 62 years (range: 17–90); 58% were males, and 37% of patients had the BRAF mutation. We included patients with a normal TSH at baseline and followed up with measurement of TSH levels during immunotherapy. In our group, 95 patients had a TSH outside the normal range: 63 not clinically significant and 32 with clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism. The 3-year overall survival rate was related to the irTAEs of clinical hypothyroidism, abnormal clinically not significant TSH, and euthyreosis at 56%, 43%, and 32%, respectively (p = 0.002). After adjusting the Cox model for potential confounding variables, clinically significant hypothyroidism was an independent prognostic factor with HR 0.51 (95% CI 0.29–0.87).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of normal (5 mmol/L), high (20 mmol/L), and fluctuating (5 and 20 mmol/L changed every day) glucose concentration in the culture medium on the viability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) co-cultured with human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (HUASMCs). The cultures were conducted on semi-permeable flat polysulfone (PSU) fibronectin-coated membranes immobilized in self-made inserts. The insert contained either HUVECs on a single membrane or HUASMCs and HUVECs on two membranes close to each other. Cultures were conducted for 7 or 14 days. Apoptosis, mitochondrial potential, and the production of reactive oxygen species and lactate by HUVECs were investigated. The results indicate that fluctuations in glucose concentration have a stronger negative effect on HUVECs viability than constant high glucose concentration. High and fluctuating glucose concentrations slow down cell proliferation compared to the culture carried out in the medium with normal glucose concentration. In conclusion, HUASMCs affect the viability of HUVECs when both types of cells are co-cultured in medium with normal or variable glucose concentration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Computer models, particularly the very complex ones (virtual patients—VP), can be used in medical education and biomedical research as well as in clinical applications. Simpler patient-specific models may aid medical procedures. However, computer models are unfit for medical devices testing. Hybrid (i.e., numerical–physical) models do not have this disadvantage. In this review, the chosen approach to the cardiovascular system and/or respiratory system modeling was discussed with particular emphasis given to the hybrid cardiopulmonary simulator (the artificial patient), that was elaborated by the authors. The VP is useful in the education of forced spirometry, investigations of cardiopulmonary interactions (including gas exchange) and its influence on pulmonary resistance during artificial ventilation, and explanation of phenomena observed during thoracentesis. The artificial patient is useful, inter alia, in staff training and education, investigations of cardiorespiratory support and the testing of several medical devices, such as ventricular assist devices and a membrane-based artificial heart."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Methods: An alginate layer with incorporated oxygenating elements de- posited on the support patch was assessed. As an oxygenating factor, perfluorooctyl was applied, and the layer coatings in two options, cross-linked and not, were evaluated. The function of human dermal fibroblast cells cultured in the presence of these constructs was analyzed, as well as their morphology using flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the membrane coating material was assessed using FTIR, AFM, and SEM-EDX characteri- zation. Results: The applied membrane coatings adsorbed on the patch ensured the viability of the human fibroblasts cultured on the membranes during 10 days of culture. However, on the sixth day of culture, the percentage of live cells grown in the presence of cross-linked alginate with oxygenat-ing factor ((ALG-PFC)net) was significantly higher than that of the cells cultured in the presence of the alginate coatings alone. SEM-EDX analysis of the (ALG-PFC)net confirmed the presence of oxygenating and cross-linking factors. In addition, the regular granular branched structure of the layer coating material involving the oxygenating and cross-linking factors was observed using the AFM technique. Conclusion: The topography of the layer coating material involving the oxygenating and cross-linking factors ensures an even contact surface for interface with the wound. Considering 5-day intervals between dressing replacements, the platform with an oxygenating configuration ensuring the growth and morphology of the human fibroblasts can be recommended at this time as an element of a dressing system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7e22"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933a878c28a0473a556c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

This study aimed to summarize the utilization and outcomes of SRT in STBS and to identify predictive factors for progression and survival.\nMaterials and methods:\nConsecutive patients with advanced STBS who underwent STBS in a sarcoma tertiary center were identified. We collected tumor- and treatment-related factors. Endpoints comprised time to local progression (TTLP), local progression-free survival (LPFS), time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS). The Cox proportional-hazards model was used to identify prognostic factors.\nResults:\nWe identified 141 patients who underwent 233 SRTs. Median follow-up was 21 months. Local and distant progression occurred after 19 and 163 SRTs, respectively. SRT for lung metastases was predictive for better TTLP and LPFS (hazard ratio, HR = 0.12, p = 0.007 and HR = 0.42, p = 0.002, respectively). Bone sarcoma (HR for TTLP = 3.18, p = 0.043; HR for LPFS = 1.99, p = 0.028) and lower administered dose (HR for TTLP = 0.98, p = 0.007; HR for LPFS = 0.99, p = 0.012) were predictive for worse TTLP and LPFS. SRT for oligometastases (HR = 0.46, p = 0.021) and lung metastases (HR = 0.55, p = 0.046) was predictive for better OS, whereas diagnosis of bone sarcoma (HR = 2.05, p = 0.029) was predictive for worse OS.\nConclusion:\nSRT provides excellent local control in STBS patients without significant toxicity. Patients with oligometastatic disease, lung metastases, and soft tissue sarcomas benefit the most from SRT. The dose escalation moderately enhances local control; however, it does not translate into better survival."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

However, most men with positive MRIs will not be diagnosed with clinically significant prostate cancer (csPC). Our goal was to evaluate pre-biopsy characteristics that influence the probability of a csPC diagnosis in these patients. We retrospectively analyzed 740 consecutive men with a positive MRI and no prior PC diagnosis who underwent MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsies of the prostate in three centers. csPC detection rates (CDRs) for each PIRADS category were calculated. Patient, disease, and lesion characteristics were studied for interdependencies with the csPC diagnosis. The CDR in patients with PIRADS categories 3, 4, and 5 was 10.5%, 30.7%, and 54.6%, respectively. On both uni- and multivariable regression models, older age, being biopsy-naïve, prostate specific antigen ≥ 10 ng/mL, smaller prostate volume, PIRADS > 3, a larger maximum lesion size, a lesion in the peripheral zone, and a positive digital rectal examination were associated with csPC. In this large, multicenter study, we provide new data regarding CDRs in particular PIRADS categories.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data of consecutive patients with no prior diagnosis of urothelial cancer who underwent a primary transurethral resection of bladder tumor (pTURBT) between January 2013 and February 2021 and were subsequently diagnosed with urothelial BC. The type of diagnosis (incidental or non-incidental) was identified. Overall, relative, recurrence-free, and progression-free survival rates (OS, RS, RFS, and PFS) after pTURBT were evaluated using the Kaplan–Meier curves and long-rank tests. A multivariable Cox regression model for the overall mortality was developed. Results: A total of 435 patients were enrolled. The median follow-up was 2.7 years. ID cases were more likely to be low-grade (LG) and non-muscle-invasive. ID vs. non-ID was associated with a trend toward an improved 7-year OS (66% vs. 49%, p = 0.092) and a significantly improved 7-year OS, if incidental cases were limited to ultrasound-detected tumors (75% vs. 49%, p = 0.013). ID was associated with improved survival among muscle-invasive BC (MIBC) patients (3-year RS: 97% vs. 23%, p < 0.001), but not among other subgroups stratified according to disease stage or grade. In multivariable analysis, only age, MIBC, and high-grade (HG) cancer demonstrated an association with mortality. PFS and RFS among non-MIBC patients did not differ in regard to the type of diagnosis. Conclusions: Incidental diagnosis may contribute to an improved survival in BC patients, most probably in the mechanism of the relative downgrading of the disease, including the possible overdiagnosis of LG tumors. Nevertheless, in the subgroup analyses, we noted marked survival benefits in MIBC cases. Further prospective studies are warranted to gain a deeper understanding of the observed associations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709429878c28a0473b7610"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Thus, artificial images closely resembling original ones can be generated. Inclusion of artificial images contributes to improving the training process. Medical domain is one of the areas where data acquisition is burdened by many procedures, laws, and prohibitions. As a result the potential size of collected datasets is reduced. This article presents the results of training Convolutional Neural Networks on a artificially extended image datasets.

predominantly metastasizes is the axillary lymph node (ALN). Thus, ALN status is a key prognostic indicator at diagnosis. The immune system has an essential role in cancer progression and dissemination, so its evaluation in ALNs could have significant applications. In the present study we aimed to investigate the association of clinical-pathological and immune variables in the primary tumour and non-metastatic ALNs (ALNs-) of a cohort of luminal A and triple-negative BC (TNBC) patients with cancer-specific survival (CSS) and time to progression (TTP).\n\nMethods: We analysed the differences in the variables between patients with different outcomes, created univariate and multivariate Cox regression models, validated them by bootstrapping and multiple imputation of missing data techniques, and used Kaplan-Meier survival curves for a 10-years follow-up.\n\nResults: We found some clinical-pathological variables at diagnosis (tumour diameter, TNBC molecular profile and presence of ALN metastasis), and the levels of several immune markers in the two studied sites, to be associated with worse CSS and TTP. Nevertheless, only CD68 and CD83 in ALNs- were confirmed as independent prognostic factors for TTP.\n\nConclusions: The study identified the importance of macrophage and dendritic cell markers as prognostic factors of relapse for BC. We highlight the importance of studying the immune response in ALNs-, which could be relevant to the prediction of BC patients' outcome."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

For this purpose, simulators should capture the complexity of human cardiorespiratory physiology in a realistic way. High fidelity simulations of pathophysiology do not only allow to test the medical device itself, but also to advance practically relevant monitoring and control features while the device acts under realistic conditions. We propose a physiologically controlled cardiorespiratory simulator developed in a mixed in silico-in vitro simulation environment. As inherent to this approach, most of the physiological model complexity is implemented in silico while the in vitro system acts as an interface to connect a medical device. As case scenarios, severe heart failure was modeled, at rest and at exercise and as medical device a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was connected to the simulator. As initial validation, the simulator output was compared against clinical data from chronic heart failure patients supported by an LVAD, that underwent different levels of exercise tests with concomitant increase in LVAD speed. Simulations were conducted reproducing the same protocol as applied in patients, in terms of exercise intensity and related LVAD speed titration. Results show that the simulator allows to capture the principal parameters of the main adaptative cardiovascular and respiratory processes within the human body occurring from rest to exercise. The simulated functional interaction with the LVAD is comparable to the one clinically observed concerning ventricular unloading, cardiac output, and pump flow. Overall, the proposed simulation system offers a high fidelity in silico-in vitro representation of the human cardiorespiratory pathophysiology. It can be used as a test bench to comprehensively analyze the performance of physically connected medical devices simulating clinically realistic, critical scenarios, thus aiding in the future the development of physiologically responding, patient-adjustable medical devices. Further validation studies will be conducted to assess the performance of the simulator in other pathophysiological conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

In a recent study by Porto et al., the impact of a caffeine-based energy drink on heart rate variability (HRV) before and after a moderate aerobic exercise (running on a treadmill) has been studied in a randomized, crossover trial on healthy and active young males. It was concluded that an energy drink consumed before exercise did not affect HRV indices during post-exercise recovery. However, this conclusion is somewhat inconsistent with the reported data and hence may be misleading.

Whereas the involvement of slow gamma in memory processing was studied by means of correlation between the gamma power and the occurrence of a given event (sharp wave ripples (SWRs), cortical transients), our approach consists of the analysis of the transmission of slow gamma itself. We use the method based on Granger causality principle—direct Directed Transfer Function, which allows to determine directed propagation of brain activity, including bidirectional flows. Four cortical sites along with CA1 ipsi- and contralateral were recorded in behaving wild-type and APP/PS1 mice before and after learning session of a spatial memory task. During slow wave sleep propagation of slow gamma was bidirectional, forming multiple loops of interaction which involved both CA1 and some of cortical sites. In episodes coincident with SWRs the number and strength of connectivity pathways increased in both groups compared to episodes without SWRs. The effect of learning was expressed only in APP/PS1 mice and consisted in strengthening of the slow gamma transmission from hippocampus to cortex as well as between both CA1 which may serve more efficient transmission of information from impaired CA1."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

The matrix-building biopolymers were crosslinked by ionotropic gelation with Ca2+ ions, chemical crosslinking with GTA or a combination of the two crosslinkers at various concentrations. The influence of the crosslinking method on the hydrogel properties, stability and structure was examined using scanning electron and optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. Analyses included tests of hydrogel equilibrium swelling ratio and release of marker substance. Subsequently, biological properties of the matrices loaded with the antibiotic chlorhexidine were studied, including cytotoxicity on HaCAT cells and antibacterial activity on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria.

Hemodiafiltration (HDF) provides much higher convection rates, thereby reliably increasing the clearance of these larger toxins. However, the high ultrafiltration volumes employed by HDF significantly increase the concentration of proteins and lipids in the dialyzer blood compartment. This has the effect of increasing plasma viscosity, which opposes solute diffusion, and increasing plasma oncotic pressure, which opposes convection. The negatively charged plasma proteins also influence the equilibration of ions between dialysate and blood compartments. These effects result in varying conditions for solute transport along the length of the dialyzer and along the radial distance from the membrane within the dialyzer fibers. High-flux dialyzers can be designed to augment solute diffusion and internal filtration, so that their performance approaches that of HDF. This avoids some of the mechanical complexity of HDF, but such enhanced dialyzers may be more difficult to manufacture, control and monitor.

The course of CLL and patients' response to treatment are varied. This variability makes it difficult to select the most appropriate treatment regimen and predict the progression of the disease. This work was aimed at developing and validating dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to predict changes of the health status of patients with CLL and progression of the disease over time. Two DBNs were developed and implemented i.e. Health Status Network (HSN) and Treatment Effect Network (TEN). Based on the literature data and expert knowledge we identified relationships linking the most important factors influencing the health status and treatment effects in patients with CLL. The developed networks, and in particular TEN, were able to predict probability of survival in patients with CLL, which was in line with the survival data collected in large medical registries. The networks can be used to personalize the predictions, taking into account a priori knowledge concerning a particular patient with CLL. The proposed approach can serve as a basis for the development of artificial intelligence systems that facilitate the choice of treatment that maximizes the chances of survival in patients with CLL."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Network identification is achieved with the Functional Source Separation (FSS) algorithm applied to electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, the neurodynamics quantified through signal complexity with the Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD), and functional connectivity with the Directed Transfer Function (DTF). This PoC is enhanced by the data collected before and after neuromodulation via transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS, both Real and Sham) in a single drug-resistant epileptic person. We observed that the signal complexity of the epileptogenic network, reduced in the pre-Real, pre-Sham, and post-Sham, reached the level of the rest of the brain post-Real tDCS.

For each train, fiber diameters were chosen at random within the allowed ranges. For each discharge the delay of triggering for each fiber at the end-plate was selected at random from an assumed range. The mean jitter values were calculated, together with the median and 95% quantile.\nResults\n\nThe results suggest that jitter is related to the mean of the individual SFP shifts.\nConclusion\n\nThese findings extend the understanding of reduced jitter measurements using a concentric needle electrode. If more than one fiber forms the peak, then jitter decreases due to averaging of individual time shifts of potentials constituting the peak, rather than due to detection of the SFP with the earliest peak."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

The status of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is a prognostic factor closely related to programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed on T lymphocytes modulating antitumor immunity. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are showing promising results in a subset of breast cancer patients in both neo- and adjuvant settings. Pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant treatment was found to be associated with better prognosis. We analyzed the prognostic and predictive significance of PD-L1 (SP142 assay) immunohistochemical expression on TNBC patients’ samples as illustrated by pCR with regard to its relation to treatment regimen, stage, BRCA mutational status and outcome. Furthermore, we analyzed a few other clinicopathological parameters such as age, TILs and proliferation index. The study highlighted a positive role of PD-L1 evaluation for personalized pCR probability assessment.

Concentrations of urea, creatinine and phosphorus in serum and in 24-h collections of urine volume were measured to calculate weekly residual renal clearance (L/week) and removed solute mass (g/week). Median [interquartile range], 24-h urine output was 560 [330–950] mL and measured GFR (the mean of creatinine and urea clearances) was 3.24 [1.47–5.67] mL/min. For urea, creatinine and phosphorus, residual renal clearance was 20.60 [11.49–35.79], 43.02 [19.13–75.48] and 17.50 [8.34–33.58] L/week, respectively, with no significant differences between CAPD and APD. Urine volume correlated positively with removed solute masses (rho = 0.82, 0.67 and 0.74) and with weekly residual renal clearances (rho = 0.77, 0.62 and 0.72 for urea, creatinine, and phosphorus, respectively, all p < 0.001).

On the other hand, type 2 diabetes is a common co-morbid condition among obese patients, and it is associated per se with brain structural and metabolic abnormalities that are related to lower cerebral blood flow (CBF). Unfortunately, only two studies evaluated the effects on co-morbid T2D on CBF, one of them in adolescent population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish a pipeline process to quantify CBF images that were obtained in an independent project evaluating brain abnormalities associated with morbid obesity and their resolution with intragastric balloon – an invasive method to reduce weight. Furthermore, we compared CBF between obese patients with and without type 2 diabetes, as well as controls at normal weight.\n\nMethods: A processing pipeline utilizing SPM12 toolbox and digital maps (AAL, Brodmann) was established to automatically pre-process scans and toolbox REX was used to prepare data for statistical analysis. We used it to analyze data for six morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes T2D (O-T2D) (average age = 48.5 ± 7.9, average body weight = 125.0 ± 29.8 kg, average BMI = 42.0 ± 9.4), eight morbidly obese patients without T2D (O-NT2D) (average age = 39.1 ± 16.1, average body weight = 138.2 ± 14.9 kg, average BMI = 50.2 ± 6.5) and eight healthy controls with normal weight (CON) (average age = 43.5 ± 11.5, average body weight = 67.4 ± 14.6 kg, average BMI = 23.4 ± 3.5). All studies were performed at the CNS Lab MRI Centre, NIBBE.\n\nResults: These preliminary analyses demonstrated lower cerebral blood flow in frontal cortex in obese patients with T2D, as compared to obese patients without T2D and controls.\n\nConclusion: A pipeline to numerically process ASL-CBF data was created and used to analyse the small dataset. The analyses indicated that not morbid obesity per se, but morbid obesity combined with co-morbid type 2 diabetes is associated with widespread reductions in cerebral perfusion. The results are in line with other studies that were limited to subjects with lower stages of overweight and obesity. We believe that this methodology may be applied to study changes in brain perfusion evoked by simulated hypergravity with Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) device placed within a magnetic resonance scanner or perfusion changes induced by hypoxia"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

HFD values depended on sleep stage and topography. HFD increased with higher levels of vigilance, being highest during wakefulness in the frontal lobe. HFD did not change from wake to stage N2 in temporo-occipital regions. The transverse temporal gyrus was the only area in which the HFD did not differ between any two vigilance stages. Interestingly, HFD of wakefulness and stage R were different mainly in the precentral gyrus, possibly reflecting motor inhibition in stage R. The fusiform and parahippocampal gyri were the only areas showing no difference between wakefulness and N2. Stages R and N2 were similar only for the postcentral gyrus. Topographical analysis of brain complexity revealed that sleep stages are clearly differentiated in fronto-central brain regions, but that temporo-occipital regions sleep differently."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Due  to  the lack of donor hearts there is a need for alternative therapies, such as total artificial hearts (TAHs). The aim of this study is to evaluate the hemodynamic performance  of  the  Realheart®  TAH,  a  new  4-  chamber  cardiac  prosthesis  device.Methods: The Realheart® TAH was connected to a hybrid cardiovascular sim-ulator  with  inflow  connections  at  the  left/right  atrium,  and  outflow  connec-tions at the ascending aorta/pulmonary artery. The Realheart® TAH was tested at  different  pumping  rates  and  stroke  volumes.  Different  systemic  resistances  (20.0- 16.7- 13.3- 10.0   Wood    units),    pulmonary    resistances    (6.7- 3.3- 1.7   Wood units), and pulmonary/systemic arterial compliances (1.4– 0.6 ml/mm Hg) were simulated.  Tests  were  also  conducted  in  static  conditions,  by  imposing  prede-fined values of preload- afterload across the artificial ventricle.Results: The  Realheart®  TAH  allows  the  operator  to  finely  tune  the  delivered  flow by regulating the pumping rate and stroke volume of the artificial ventri-cles.  For  a  systemic  resistance  of  16.7  Wood  units,  the  TAH  flow  ranges  from  2.7  ±  0.1  to  6.9  ±  0.1  L/min.  For  a  pulmonary  resistance  of  3.3  Wood  units,  the  TAH  flow  ranges  from  3.1  ±  0.0  to  8.2  ±  0.3  L/min.  The  Realheart®  TAH  delivered a pulse pressure ranging between ~25 mm Hg and ~50 mm Hg for the tested conditions.Conclusions: The  Realheart®  TAH  offers  great  flexibility  to  adjust  the  output  flow  and  delivers  good  pressure  pulsatility  in  the  vessels.  Low  sensitivity  of  de-vice flow to the pressure drop across it was identified and a new version is under development to counteract this."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

The optimal Ti thickness was determined to be 130 nm. Compared to the use of a conventional constant bias of 25 V, a bias ranging from 5 V to 20 V with a step size of 5 V for 3 min per period can be used to prepare a titanium oxide (TiOx) layer with nanohollows that shows a large increase in current of 142% under UV illumination provided by a 365 nm LED at a power of 83 mW. Based on AFM and SEM, the TiOx grains formed in the step-bias anodic oxidation were found to lead to nanohollow generation. Results obtained from EDS mapping, HR-TEM and XPS all verified the TiOx composition and supported nanohollow formation. The nanohollows formed in a thin TiOx layer can lead to a high surface roughness and photon absorbance for photocurrent generation. With this step-bias anodic oxidation methodology, TiOx with nanohollows can be obtained easily without any extra cost for realizing a high current under photoelectrochemical measurements that shows potential for electrochemical-based sensing applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Infected foot ulcer causes a 5-year mortality of 50%. Proper treatment of foot wounds is essential, and wound area monitoring plays an important role in this area. In this article, we describe an automatic wound area measurement service that facilitates area measurement and the measurement result is based on adaptive calibration for larger accuracy at curved surfaces. Users need to take a digital picture of a wound and calibration markers and send them for analysis using an Internet page. The deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) was trained using 565 wound images and was used for image segmentation to identify the wound and calibration markers. The developed software calculates the wound area based on the number of pixels in the wound region and the calibration coefficient determined from distances between ticks at calibration markers. The result of the measurement is sent back to the user at the provided e-mail address. The median relative error of wound area measurement in the wound models was 1.21%. The efficacy of the CNN model was tested on 41 wounds and 73 wound models. The averaged values for the dice similarity coefficient, intersection over union, accuracy and specificity for wound identification were 90.9%, 83.9%, 99.3% and 99.6%, respectively. The service proved its high efficacy and can be used in wound area monitoring. The service may be used not only by health care specialists but also by patients.

The crucial question analyzed by us is, whether the low frequency (LF) band (0.05–0.15 Hz) or the intermediate frequency (IMF) band (0.1–0.2 Hz) is more eminent in respect of the information flow between body (heart rate and respiration) and BOLD signals in cortex and brainstem. A recently published study with the LF band in fMRI-naïve subjects revealed an intensive information flow from the cortex to the brainstem and a weaker flow from the brainstem to the cortex. The comparison of both bands revealed a significant information flow from the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) to the precentral gyrus (PCG) and from brainstem to PCG only in the IMF band. This pattern of directed coupling between slow oscillations in the cortex and brainstem not only supports the existence of a pacemaker-like structure in brainstem, but provides first evidence that oscillations centered at 0.15/0.16 Hz can also emerge in brain networks.

The rate of vascular refilling depends on the imbalance between the Starling forces acting across the capillary walls as well as on their hydraulic conductivity and total surface area. Various approaches have been proposed to assess the vascular refilling process during HD, including the so-called refilling coefficient (Kr) that describes the rate of vascular refilling per changes in plasma oncotic pressure, assuming that other Starling forces and the flow of lymph remain constant during HD. Several studies have shown that Kr decreases exponentially during HD, which was attributed to a dialysis-induced decrease in the whole-body capillary hydraulic conductivity (LpS). Here, we employ a lumped-parameter mathematical model of the cardiovascular system and water and solute transport between the main body fluid compartments to assess the impact of all Starling forces and the flow of lymph on vascular refilling during HD in order to explain the reasons behind the observed intradialytic decrease in Kr. We simulated several HD sessions in a virtual patient with different blood priming procedures, ultrafiltration rates, session durations, and constant or variable levels of LpS. We show that the intradialytic decrease in Kr is not associated with a possible reduction of LpS but results from the inherent assumption that plasma oncotic pressure is the only variable Starling force during HD, whereas in fact other Starling forces, in particular the oncotic pressure of the interstitial fluid, have an important impact on the transcapillary fluid exchange during HD. We conclude that Kr is not a good marker of LpS and should not be used to guide fluid removal during HD or to assess the fluid status of dialysis patients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

However, the mechanisms behind their effectiveness are not yet fully understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of the pH-regulatory enzyme carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) in ICI success. Consequently, we developed an in silico model of the tumour microenvironment. The hybrid model consists of an agent-based model of tumour–immune cell interactions, coupled with a set of diffusion-reaction equations describing substances in the environment. It is calibrated with data from the literature, enabling the study of its qualitative behaviour. In our model, CAIX-expressing tumours acidified their neighbourhood, thereby reducing immune infiltration by 90% (p < 0.001) and resulting in a 25% increase in tumour burden (p < 0.001). Moreover, suppression of CAIX improved the response to anti-PD-1 (23% tumour reduction in CAIX knockouts and 6% in CAIX-expressing tumours, p < 0.001), independently of initial PD-L1 expression. Our simulations suggest that patients with CAIX-expressing tumours could respond favourably to combining ICIs with CAIX suppression, even in the absence of pre-treatment PD-L1 expression. Furthermore, when calibrated with tumour-type-specific data, our model could serve as a high-throughput tool for testing the effectiveness of such a combinatorial approach."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

This study presents Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI) on two different scaffolds for the treatment of lesions in hyaline cartilage in rabbits. The first one is a commercially available scaffold (Chondro–Gide) made of collagen type I/III and the second one is a polyethersulfone (PES) synthetic membrane, manufactured by phase inversion. The revolutionary idea in the present study is the fact that we used PES membranes, which have unique features and benefits that are desirable for the 3D cultivation of chondrocytes. Sixty-four White New Zealand rabbits were used in this research. Defects penetrating into the subchondral bone were filled with or without the placement of chondrocytes on collagen or PES membranes after two weeks of culture. The expression of the gene encoding type II procollagen, a molecular marker of chondrocytes, was evaluated. Elemental analysis was performed to estimate the weight of tissue grown on the PES membrane. The reparative tissue was analyzed macroscopically and histologically after surgery at 12, 25, and 52 weeks. RT-PCR analysis of the mRNA isolated from cells detached from the polysulphonic membrane revealed the expression of type II procollagen. The elementary analysis of polysulphonic membrane slices after 2 weeks of culture with chondrocytes revealed a concentration of 0.23 mg of tissue on one part of the membrane. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluation indicated that the quality of regenerated tissue was similar after the transplantation of cells placed on polysulphonic or collagen membranes. The established method for the culture and transplantation of chondrocytes placed on polysulphonic membranes resulted in the growth of the regenerated tissue, revealing the morphology of hyaline-like cartilage to be of similar quality to collagen membranes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

We encountered a cluster of 3 cases of PD patients who developed hyperosmolar hyponatremia during on-label use of icodextrin. This appeared to be due to absorption of icodextrin since after stopping icodextrin, the serum sodium level and osmol gap returned to normal, while a rechallenge again resulted in hyperosmolar hyponatremia. We excluded higher than usual concentrations of specific fractions of dextrins in fresh icodextrin dialysis fluid (lot numbers of used batches were checked by manufacturer). We speculate that in our patients, either an exaggerated degradation of polysaccharide chains by α-amylase activity in dialysate, lymph, and interstitium and/or rapid hydrolysis of the absorbed larger degradation products in the circulation may have contributed to the hyperosmolality observed, with the concentration of oligosaccharides exceeding the capacity of intracellular enzymes (in particular maltase) to metabolize these products to glucose. Both hyponatremia and hyperosmolality are risk factors for poor outcomes in PD patients. Less conventional PD prescriptions such as off-label use of two exchanges of 2 L icodextrin might raise the risk of this threatening side effect. This brief report is intended to create awareness of a rare complication of on-label icodextrin use in a subset of PD patients and/or PD prescriptions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

It was detected using wave-by-wave analysis of cardiorespiratory rhythms and was considered to reflect a strategy of anxiety management involving the activation of a neural pacemaker. Results were consistent with slow breathing, but contained uncertainty at normal breathing rates (0.2–0.4 Hz). Objectives and methods: We combined wave-by-wave analysis and directed information flow analysis to obtain information on anxiety management at higher breathing rates. We analyzed cardiorespiratory rhythms and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals from the brainstem and cortex in 10 healthy fMRI participants with elevated anxiety. Results: Three subjects with slow respiratory, RRI, and neural BOLD oscillations showed 57 ± 26% negative RSA and significant anxiety reduction by 54 ± 9%. Six participants with breathing rate of ~0.3 Hz showed 41 ± 16% negative RSA and weaker anxiety reduction. They presented significant information flow from RRI to respiration and from the middle frontal cortex to the brainstem, which may result from respiration-entrained brain oscillations, indicating another anxiety management strategy. Conclusions: The two analytical approaches applied here indicate at least two different anxiety management strategies in healthy subjects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dff2","uid":"blqXEkO57hLU6bspxdVDP-A","uuid":"96dbb5e4-750c-4f56-bff0-8d9143c48d92","name":"Wydział Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709356878c28a0473a7954"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Bicarbonate is added to the dialysis fluid during HD to replenish the buffers in the body and neutralize interdialytic acid accumulation. Predicting HD outcomes with mathematical models can help select the optimal patient-specific dialysate composition, but the kinetics of bicarbonate are difficult to quantify, because of the many factors involved in the regulation of the bicarbonate buffer in bodily fluids. We implemented a mathematical model of dissolved CO2 and bicarbonate transport that describes the changes in acid-base equilibrium induced by HD to assess the kinetics of bicarbonate, dissolved CO2, and other buffers not only in plasma but also in erythrocytes, interstitial fluid, and tissue cells; the model also includes respiratory control over the partial pressures of CO2 and oxygen.

The study presents three types of scaffolds obtained from a blend of polyethersulfone (PES) and polyurethane (PUR) by a combination of wet-phase inversion and salt-leaching methods. The nonwovens made of gelatin and sodium chloride (NaCl) were used as precursors of macropores. Thus, obtained membranes were characterized by a suitable structure. The top layers were perforated, with pores over 20 µm, which allows cells to enter the membrane. The use of a nonwoven made it possible to develop a three-dimensional network of interconnected macropores that is required for cell activity and mobility. Examination of wettability (contact angle, swelling ratio) showed a hydrophilic nature of scaffolds. The mechanical test showed that the scaffolds were suitable for knee joint applications (stress above 10 MPa). Next, the scaffolds underwent a degradation study in simulated body fluid (SBF). Weight loss after four weeks and changes in structure were assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and MeMoExplorer Software, a program that estimates the size of pores. The porosity measurements after degradation confirmed an increase in pore size, as expected. Hydrolysis was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis, where the disappearance of ester bonds at about 1730 cm−1 wavelength is noticeable after degradation. The obtained results showed that the scaffolds meet the requirements for cartilage tissue engineering membranes and should undergo further testing on an animal model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","uid":"bL0dXXB9qN74NNNOmYDF46Q","uuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","name":"Instytut Podstawowych Problemów Techniki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70949d878c28a0473c06f9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","parentUuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","rootUuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

As well as acute risks of hypo- or hyper- glycemia, long-term vascular complications may occur, including coronary heart disease or stroke, as well as diabetic nephropathy leading to end-stage disease, neuropathy or retinopathy. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve diabetes management to reduce the risk of complications but also to improve patient’s quality life. The impact of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is well recognized, in this regard. The current review aims at introducing the basic principles of glucose sensing, including electrochemical and optical detection, summarizing CGM technology, its requirements, advantages, and disadvantages. The role of CGM systems in the clinical diagnostics/personal testing, difficulties in their utilization, and recommendations are also discussed. In the end, challenges and prospects in future CGM systems are discussed and non-invasive, wearable glucose biosensors are introduced. Though the scope of this review is CGMs and provides information about medical issues and analytical principles, consideration of broader use will be critical in future if the right systems are to be selected for effective diabetes management."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

However, as HV also lowers cerebral blood flow (CBF), it may provoke misery perfusion (MP), in which the decrease in CBF is coupled with increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). MP may rapidly lead to the exhaustion of brain energy metabolites, making the brain vulnerable to ischemia. MP is difficult to detect at the bedside, which is where transcranial hybrid, near-infrared spectroscopies are promising because they non-invasively measure OEF and CBF. We have tested this technology during HV (∼30 min) with bilateral, frontal lobe monitoring to assess MP in 27 sessions in 18 patients with traumatic brain injury. In this study, HV did not lead to MP at a group level (p > 0.05). However, a statistical approach yielded 89 events with a high probability of MP in 19 sessions. We have characterized each statistically significant event in detail and its possible relationship to clinical and radiological status (decompressive craniectomy and presence of a cerebral lesion), without detecting any statistically significant difference (p > 0.05). However, MP detection stresses the need for personalized, real-time assessment in future clinical trials with HV, in order to provide an optimal evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of HV. Our study provides pilot data demonstrating that bedside transcranial hybrid near-infrared spectroscopies could be utilized to assess potential MP."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Fourier Transform Layer is introduced to increase the processing speed without sacrificing accuracy. The motivation is to present and compare an alternative approach to Convolutional Neural Networks, which could reduce the need for GPU training. Models containing only the novel layer were trained to classify images from widely accepted datasets and compared to classification results of simple models containing one convolutional layer. The comparison was performed in terms of test accuracy, Area-Under-Curve and training times. The results showed that, for images of size 128 × 128 and larger, models with the proposed layer reached test accuracy comparable to that reached by convolutional models (accuracy: 96% and 98% respectively), with at least 27% decrease in training time per one epoch on Central Processing Unit."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

In this work the fibers are modified by the addition of drug-loaded microspheres acting as micro-containers for the drug and increasing the total drug capacity of the system. Its release from such a structure is slowed down by placing the microspheres inside the fibers so they are covered with an outer layer of fiber-forming polymer. The work presents a new method (microsphere suspension electrospinning) of obtaining polyvinylpyrrolidone fibers cross-linked with UV light modified with polycaprolactone/polyethersulphone microspheres loaded with active substance – rhodamine 640 as a marker or ampicillin as a drug example. The influence of UV-cross-linking time and the microspheres addition on the degradation, mechanical strength and transport properties of fibrous mats was investigated. The mats were insoluble in water, in some cases mechanically stronger, their drug capacity was increased and the burst effect was eliminated. The antibacterial properties of ampicillin-loaded mats were confirmed.

subtype is particularly challenging, especially in patients who cannot achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Although the tumor microenvironment (TME) is known to influence disease progression and the effectiveness of therapeutics, its predictive and prognostic potential remains uncertain. This work aimed to define the residual TME profile after NAC of a retrospective cohort with 96 TNBC patients by immunohistochemical staining (cell markers) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (genetic markers). Kaplan–Meier curves were used to estimate the influence of the selected TME markers on five-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) probabilities. The risks of each variable being associated with relapse and death were determined through univariate and multivariate Cox analyses. We describe a unique tumor-infiltrating immune profile with high levels of lymphocytes (CD4, FOXP3) and dendritic cells (CD21, CD1a and CD83) that are valuable prognostic factors in post-NAC TNBC patients. Our study also demonstrates the value of considering not only cellular but also genetic TME markers such as MUC-1 and CXCL13 in routine clinical diagnosis to refine prognosis modelling."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

This work aimed to characterize the residual TME composition in 96 TNBC patients using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques and evaluate its prognostic implications for partial responders vs. non-responders. Compared with non-responders, partial responders containing higher levels of CD83+ mature dendritic cells, FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, and IL-15 expression but lower CD138+ cell concentration exhibited better OS and RFS. However, along with tumor diameter and positive nodal status at diagnosis, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression in the residual TME was identified as an independent factor associated with the impaired response to NAC. This study yields new insights into the key components of the residual tumor bed, such as MMP-9, which is strictly associated with the lack of a pathological response to NAC. This knowledge might help early identification of TNBC patients less likely to respond to NAC and allow the establishment of new therapeutic targets."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

However, immunotherapy resistance constitutes a significant challenge. To investigate carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) as a driver of resistance, we built a differential equation model of tumor-immune interactions. The model considers treatment with the small molecule CAIX inhibitor SLC-0111 in combination with ICIs. Numerical simulations showed that, given an efficient immune response, CAIX KO tumors tended toward tumor elimination in contrast to their CAIX-expressing counterparts, which stabilized close to the positive equilibrium. Importantly, we demonstrated that short-term combination therapy with a CAIX inhibitor and immunotherapy could shift the asymptotic behavior of the original model from stable disease to tumor eradication. Finally, we calibrated the model with data from murine experiments on CAIX suppression and combination therapy with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. Concluding, we have developed a model that reproduces experimental findings and enables the investigation of combination therapies. Our model suggests that transient CAIX inhibition may induce tumor regression, given a sufficient immune infiltrate in the tumor, which can be boosted with ICIs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

To avoid pain, patients undergoing TP biopsy may be offered sedation or general anesthesia. Our aim was to investigate the degree of patient-reported pain for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/ultrasound (US) fusion biopsy of the prostate being performed under local anesthesia (LA) and to study for possible factors associated with increased risk of significant pain (SP) in this setting.\n\nMethods: In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed data of consecutive patients without a prior diagnosis of PC who underwent MRI/US software fusion biopsy of the prostate under LA with lidocaine at two centers between May 2020 and April 2022, and who reported their periprocedural pain on a Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (0–10). We defined SP as reported pain score of 6–10. Patient and procedure characteristics together with SP were studied for interdependencies.\n\nResults: A total of 299 patients were included. Median pain score was 2 (interquartile range: 2–4), with SP having been reported by 55 (18.4%) patients. Among patient characteristics, only age demonstrated association with SP [odds ratio (OR), per 10 years =0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.35–0.80, P=0.003] and patients aged 62 or above were significantly less likely to report SP (OR =0.33, 95% CI: 0.18–0.60, P<0.001).\n\nConclusions: Performing TP MRI/US fusion prostate biopsy under LA is associated with low rates of SP, with the risk being significantly lower in older men. The results of this study can serve as evidence resource for preprocedural counselling in patients especially concerned about the risk of pain."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

cytosolic bifunctional geranyl/farnesyl diphosphate synthase provides MVA-derived GPP for geraniol biosynthesis in rose flowers.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Geraniol derived from essential oils of various plant species is widely used in the cosmetic and perfume industries. It is also an essential trait of the pleasant smell of rose flowers. In contrast to other monoterpenes which are produced in plastids via the methyl erythritol phosphate pathway, geraniol biosynthesis in roses relies on cytosolic NUDX1 hydrolase which dephosphorylates geranyl diphosphate (GPP). However, the metabolic origin of cytosolic GPP remains unknown. By feeding Rosa chinensis “Old Blush” flowers with pathway-specific precursors and inhibitors, combined with metabolic profiling and functional characterization of enzymes in vitro and in planta, we show that geraniol is synthesized through the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway by a bifunctional geranyl/farnesyl diphosphate synthase, RcG/FPPS1, producing both GPP and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). The downregulation and overexpression of RcG/FPPS1 in rose petals affected not only geraniol and germacrene D emissions but also dihydro-β-ionol, the latter due to metabolic cross talk of RcG/FPPS1-dependent isoprenoid intermediates trafficking from the cytosol to plastids. Phylogenetic analysis together with functional characterization of G/FPPS orthologs revealed that the G/FPPS activity is conserved among Rosaceae species. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamic simulations enabled to identify two conserved amino acids that evolved from ancestral FPPSs and contribute to GPP/FPP product specificity. Overall, this study elucidates the origin of the cytosolic GPP for NUDX1-dependent geraniol production, provides insights into the emergence of the RcG/FPPS1 GPPS activity from the ancestral FPPSs, and shows that RcG/FPPS1 plays a key role in the biosynthesis of volatile terpenoid compounds in rose flowers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","uid":"bKH7OhxrOAmP_ULnBGYKnJQ","uuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","name":"Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f47"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","parentUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","rootUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

The biosensor utilizes a dsDNA decamer (5′-GCGTTGTCGC-3′) that selectively interacts with SN38. The biosensor, consisting of a screen-printed graphite electrode with the dsDNA decamer as the recognition layer, demonstrates stability, sensitivity, and selectivity towards SN38 through electrochemical studies. It offers a wide linear range of 1–200 nM, comparable to the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, with a sensitivity of 57 nA/nM and a detection limit of 1.06 nM. Compared to a bare graphite electrode, the biosensor exhibits a significant 31-fold increase in sensitivity and a detection limit three orders of magnitude lower. Selectivity studies were conducted using electrochemically active and inactive interferents, including biologically active compounds. Bioreceptor interactions with chosen interferents were examined using HPLC and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Tests of the biosensor was performed using laboratory samples and artificial urine samples spiked with SN38. This disposable biosensor, based on dsDNA, provides an innovative approach for accurately determining SN38 levels in the therapeutic drug concentration range. It holds promise as an alternative method for clinical diagnosis and monitoring of SN38 levels in cancer patients undergoing irinotecan treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc1","uid":"b21X69XXr6O_0TDjOCQ3WhA","uuid":"8b0d7c21-1910-4cfc-be64-151bb01ed2be","name":"Narodowy Instytut Leków","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940b878c28a0473b551d"],"parentId":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc1","parentUuid":"8b0d7c21-1910-4cfc-be64-151bb01ed2be","rootId":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc1","rootUuid":"8b0d7c21-1910-4cfc-be64-151bb01ed2be","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

outbreak led to a global ventilator shortage. Hence, various strategies for\r\nusing a single ventilator to support multiple patients have been considered. A device called Ventil\r\npreviously validated for independent lung ventilation was used in this study to evaluate its usability\r\nfor shared ventilation. We performed experiments with a total number of 16 animals. Eight pairs\r\nof pigs were ventilated by a ventilator or anesthetic machine and by Ventil for up to 27 h. In one\r\nexperiment, 200 ml of saline was introduced to one subject’s lungs to reduce their compliance. The\r\nexperiments were analyzed in terms of arterial blood gases and respiratory parameters. In addition\r\nto the animal study, we performed a series of laboratory experiments with artifcial lungs (ALs).\r\nThe resistance and compliance of one AL (afected) were altered, while the tidal volume (TV) and\r\npeak pressure (Ppeak) in the second (unafected) AL were analyzed. In addition, to assess the risk\r\nof transmission of pathogens between AL respiratory tracts, laboratory tests were performed using\r\nphantoms of virus particles. The physiological level of analyzed parameters in ventilated animals was\r\nmaintained, except for CO2 tension, for which a permissive hypercapnia was indicated. Experiments\r\ndid not lead to injuries in the animal’s lungs except for one subject, as indicated by CT scan analysis. In\r\nlaboratory experiments, changes in TV and Ppeak in the unafected AL were less than 11%, except for\r\n2 cases where the TV change was 20%. No cross-contamination was found in simulations of pathogen\r\ntransmission. We conclude that ventilation using Ventil can be considered safe in patients undergoing\r\ndeep sedation without spontaneous breathing eforts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Early and accurate diagnosis of AIS is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Non-invasive monitoring techniques, such as time domain near-infrared spectroscopy (tdNIRS), have shown potential for real-time monitoring of AIS patients at the bedside. However, there is a need for further research to evaluate the effectiveness of tdNIRS in the acute phase of stroke. In this study, we present the results of a case report using tdNIRS to monitor AIS patients without any additional stimulation.

The high absorbability of the implants will enable their use as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) carriers in future medical devices. Surface modification by dipping enabled the deposition of the hydrophilic chitosan (CS) layer, maintaining good bone tissue properties and high absorbability (850% dry weight). Introducing CS increases surface roughness and causes local changes in surface free energy, promoting bone cell adhesion. Through this research, we have developed a new and original method of low-temperature modification of PLA substitutes with chitosan. This method uses non-toxic reagents that do not cause changes in the structure of the PLA matrix. The obtained bone substitutes are characterised by exceptionally high hydrophilicity and morphology similar to spongy bone.

A potential approach for managing such bacteria involves the use of their natural killers, namely lytic bacteriophages. Another effective method involves the use of metal nanoparticles with antimicrobial properties. However, the use of lytic phages armed with nanoparticles as an effective antimicrobial strategy, particularly with respect to biofilms, remains unexplored. Here, we show that T7 phages armed with silver nanoparticles exhibit greater efficacy in terms of controlling bacterial biofilm, compared with phages or nanoparticles alone. We initially identified a novel silver nanoparticle-binding peptide, then constructed T7 phages that successfully displayed the peptide on the outer surface of the viral head. These recombinant, AgNP-binding phages could effectively eradicate bacterial biofilm, even when used at low concentrations. Additionally, when used at concentrations that could eradicate bacterial biofilm, T7 phages armed with silver nanoparticles were not toxic to eukaryotic cells. Our results show that the novel combination of lytic phages with phage-bound silver nanoparticles is an effective, synergistic and safe strategy for the treatment of bacterial biofilms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7de7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7de7","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5a3","5e7093b6878c28a0473af945","663a0bf64097077c1aa93f31","5e70940c878c28a0473b5733","5e709358878c28a0473a7bbd"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

COVID-19 gave opportunity to test VDH under conditions different from aging.\nMethods: 25 patients were examined 3–6 month after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subjective worsening of mental\nfunctions, presumably caused by the disease, was quantified with three psychometric tests. Blood flow wave-\nforms were obtained for the left brachial and common carotid arteries. The waveform shape changes continu-\nously with age; therefore, an individual shape can be characterized by the index WA being the calendar age (CA)\nof the average healthy rested subject having the most similar shape (consequently, in healthy rested subjects WA-\nCA = 0, in average). The mathematical functional analysis was used to calculate WA.\nResults: Brachial WA-CA = 13 yrs, in average (p < 0.00005; Cohen’s d = 0.99), and was correlated with tests\nscores (r = 0.55, 0.65, 0.46).

PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in elderly people after Alzheimer's disease. The α-synuclein protein in patients’ blood may be a potential biomarker in the early stage of PD. Detection of α-synuclein with high sensitivity and nonspecific binding through HfO2-EGFET biosensors has the advantages of low cost and simple fabrication from disposable EGs. Among the duty cycle conditions tested, HfO2 deposited at a 25% duty cycle in HiPIMS exhibited superior pH sensitivity and linearity, with values of 56.4 mV/pH and 99.7%, respectively. The hysteresis width and drift coefficient are −3 mV and 0.3 mV/h, respectively. To overcome the Debye length limitation, 100-fold diluted phosphate buffer solution and the PMOS configuration were used to determine the α-synuclein for which the isoelectric point was 4.67. The negative gate bias in the PMOS configuration successfully causes α-synuclein to approach the surface of HfO2 EG to achieve a sensitivity of 12.1 mV/dec and a linearity of 99.5% in the range of 0.1–1000 . The limit of detection is 0.198 , and the immobilized surface ultimately binds specifically, resulting in low interference signals from other related biomarkers. This promising study shows that detecting various proteins involved in different diseases and performing clinical tests can be accomplished in the future."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

The aim of this study was to determine the geometric parameters characterising their positions and sizes in order to analyse the diffusion of the ventilation/perfusion ratio. Material and methods: A developed virtual respiratory system has been supplemented with an appropriate model of pulmonary circulation that uses a lung outline that is divided into parts based on an anatomical atlas and a CT image; it comprises a 3D geometric model of the lungs that was developed using the Inventor CAD software (Autodesk, Inc, San Francisco, USA). Each panel was divided into 2 horizontal and 8 vertical parts; the 16-part division was then modified. Results: When taking human lungs as a research object and simulating their accompanying physical, biological, or biochemical phenomena, one necessary task is to construct a spatial model of the lungs that takes into account, and maintains awareness of, the limitations of the source of data that is relied upon. The developed modified geometric model of lung division turned out to be useful and was successfully applied to a virtual patient, among others, as part of the VirRespir project. Conclusions: Finally, we can conclude that the virtual cardiorespiratory system thus elaborated may serve as a proper tool for the preliminary analysis of such complex interactions, considering the elaborated model of the lung’s divisions and its future improvements."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Factors such as inflammation, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglucagonemia, mitochondrial dysfunction, glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity contribute to the development of IR. Despite being extensively studied for over 60 years, assessing the incidence of IR, developing effective prevention strategies, and implementing appropriate therapeutic approaches remain challenging. This review explores the multifaceted nature of IR, including its association with various conditions such as obesity, primary hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, Alzheimer’s disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, chronic kidney disease and cancer. Additionally, we discuss the complexity of diagnosing and quantifying IR, emphasizing the lack of absolute, common criteria for classification. We delve into the use of mathematical models in clinical and epidemiological studies, focusing on the choice between insulin, triglycerides, or waist-to-hip ratio as IR determinants. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of reliable input data and caution in interpreting results when utilizing mathematical models for IR assessment. This narrative review aims to provide insights into the challenges and considerations involved in conducting IR diagnostics, with implications for clinical practice, epidemiological research, and future advancements in this field."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Therefore it is of great importance to be able to produce a large number of disaggregated microspheres with a narrow diameter distribution. This work describes the successful elaboration of the method combining electrospray and wet phase inversion for the manufacturing of such polymer microspheres with mean diameters of 2 – 15 µm. Their recovery and drying are easy and they can be directly applied afterwards. The method is universal enough to produce microspheres from various polymers (polycaprolactone, polyethersulfone) and different solvents (dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone). It was noticed on the basis of microscopic images and using the nitrogen adsorption–desorption method that the specific surface of the microspheres differs depending on the polymer and solvent used. The work introduces additional parameters resulting from the use of pulsed voltage in the electrospray (pulse frequency f and duration τ) which results in better process control. As an example of the use of microspheres as drug carriers, they were loaded with rhodamine and its release was tested. Such microspheres could be dispersed in polymer solution and used in extrusion-based techniques (electrospinning, 3D printing) to form novel complex drug delivery systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

The 72 base pair-long 5′[(TAGAGGATCAAA)AAA]4TAGAGGATCAAA3’ sequence with the highest affinity to lactoferrin was selected for further investigations. Kinetic analysis of the interaction between selected DNA and lactoferrin provided rate and equilibrium constants: ka = (2.49 ± 0.03)∙104 M−1∙s−1, kd = (1.89 ± 0.02)∙10−3 s−1, KA = (0.13 ± 0.05)∙108 M−1, and KD = (7.61 ± 0.18)∙10−8 M. Thermodynamic study conducted to determine the ΔH0, ΔS0, and ΔG0 for van't Hoff characteristic in the temperature range of 291.15–305.15 K, revealed the complex formation as endothermic and entropically driven. The chosen DNA sequence's selectivity towards lactoferrin was confirmed with interferents' response constituting <3 % of the response to lactoferrin. SPR analysis justified utility of the designed DNA oligonucleotide for Lf determination, with LOD of 4.42∙10−9 M. Finally, the interaction between lactoferrin and DNA was confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, providing the basis for further quantitative assay of lactoferrin using the developed DNA-based bioreceptor. The interactions were performed under immobilized DNA ligand conditions, thus reflecting the sensor's surface, which facilitates their transfer to other label-free biosensor technologies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

The aim of this study was to develop a method for more objective determination of such RBV increase to improve the accuracy of ABV estimation.\nMethods\n\nWe proposed a numerical algorithm consisting of interpolation and polynomial fitting of RBV signals, which we evaluated on data from 64 HD sessions in 48 patients with 240 mL of dialysate infused approximately 1 h into HD. The estimated ABV values were compared with those from a simple two-point method described previously as well as with the values calculated using the Nadler formula and the Lemmens-Bernstein-Brodsky formula.\nResults\n\nCompared to the simple method, the improved method provided higher (more plausible) estimates of ABV (median 4.79 vs 4.53 L, p < 0.001) and specific ABV (median 68.5 vs 66.4 mL/kg, p < 0.001). The improved method also provided much lower intra-patient variability of ABV estimated in different sessions of the same week (median spread 180 vs 462 mL, p < 0.001) and showed narrower limits of agreement with both Nadler and Lemmens-Bernstein-Brodsky formulae.\nConclusion\n\nThe proposed numerical method constitutes a substantial improvement over the simple method by averaging the noise and short-term variability in RBV signals.\nSignificance\n\nMore accurate estimates of ABV in HD patients could aid in managing their fluid status."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

The alginate coating layer with incorporated albumin-coated oxygenating element was designed (ALG_Alb-PFD). As an oxygenating factor, perfluorodecalin was applied at three saturation levels with oxygen: 0%, 21%, and 100%. The studies were performed on human adenocarcinoma A549 cell lines derived from human lung epithelial cells cultured in configuration with the designed coatings. Scanning electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy were applied to evaluate cell function and the system morphology. AFM and SEM-EDX characterized the coating layer material. The designed coating ensured the viability of human lung cells cultured on the coating layer during 10 days of culture. An oxygenating factor presence was confirmed by SEM-EDX analysis of the ALG_Alb-PFD. However, no significant discrepancies were noted between the coatings with different saturation levels after 10 days of culture. Moreover, the AFM-analyzed profiles of the coating surface confirmed/indicated the formation of additional elements in the coating due to using an oxygenating element, which increases the effective contact area with cells. The platform based on alginate with the developed surface of contact of oxygenating factor incorporated within the coating layer ensures the sustained growth and morphology of the human lung cells, which can be considered a therapeutic element of system components of medical devices for maintaining human lung cells’ function."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Obtaining hollow-fiber membranes, unlike flat membranes, requires the use of a special installation for their production, the most important component of which is the hollow fiber forming spinneret. This method is most often used in obtaining membranes made of polysulfone, polyethersulfone, polyurethane, cellulose acetate, and its derivatives. Many factors affect the properties of the membranes obtained. By changing the parameters of the spinning process, we change the thickness of the membranes’ walls and the diameter of the hollow fibers, which causes changes in the membranes’ structure and, as a consequence, changes in their transport/separation parameters. The type of bore fluid affects the porosity of the inner epidermal layer or causes its atrophy. Porogenic compounds such as polyvinylpyrrolidones and polyethylene glycols and other substances that additionally increase the membrane porosity are often added to the polymer solution. Another example is a blend of two- or multi-component membranes and dual-layer membranes that are obtained using a three-nozzle spinneret. In dual-layer membranes, one layer is the membrane scaffolding, and the other is the separation layer.

The spatial orientation of the biosensing layer was defined by the immobilization of dsDNA oligonucleotide via H2N- group at 5’ end. The fabricated biosensors were characterized using both faradaic and non-faradaic models and proposing the Randles-based electrical equivalent circuits. Analysis of experimental data employing faradaic model equivalent circuits revealed a charge transfer resistance parameter R3 f dependent on the lactoferrin concentration. Hence, the biosensor response was established as the relationship between the ratio before/after bioreceptor-analyte interaction and the analyte concentration. The linear response of the developed impedimetric biosensors for laboratory samples was in the lactoferrin concentration range up to 625 nM with limit of detection of 1.25 nM. Notably, this study marked the pioneering application of these biosensors for quantitative lactoferrin detection in human saliva samples. The results exhibited accordance with the surface plasmon resonance method utilizing the same DNA-type receptor applied and colorimetric immunoassay. The presented impedimetric DNA-based biosensor for lactoferrin addresses the pressing need for rapid, simple, and effective analytical methods of immunomodulators detection with applicatory potential in clinical diagnosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Forty-eight rabbits (96 knee joints) were used in the project. The synthetic, macro-porous PES membranes were used as scaffolds. Fragments of articular cartilage were harvested from non-weight-bearing areas of the joints of the animals. Chondrocytes were isolated and then cultivated on PES scaffolds for 3 weeks. The animals were divided into four groups. All the lesions in the articular cartilage were full thickness defects. In Group I, autogenic chondrocytes on PES membranes were transplanted into the defect area; in Group II, allogenic chondrocytes on PES membranes were transplanted into the defect area; in Group III, pure PES membranes were transplanted into the defect area; and in Group IV, lesions were left untreated. Half of the animals from each group were terminated after 8 weeks, and the remaining half were terminated 12 weeks postoperatively. The samples underwent macroscopic evaluation using the Brittberg scale and microscopic evaluation using the O’Driscoll scale. The best regeneration was observed in Groups II and I. In Group I, the results were achieved with two surgeries, while in Group II, only one operation was needed. This indicates that allogenic chondrocytes do not require two surgeries, highlighting the importance of further in vivo studies to better understand this advantage. The success of the study and the desired properties of PES scaffolds are attributed mainly to the presence of sulfonic groups in the structure of the material. These groups, similar to chondroitin sulfate, which naturally occurs in hyaline cartilage, likely enable mutual affinity between the scaffold and cells and promote scaffold colonization by the cells."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d5878c28a0473b193c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

In this study, a previously developed hybrid (hydro-numerical) simulator of the cardiovascular system (HCS) was adapted and used. In our HCS Björk-Shiley mechanical heart valves were used, playing the role of mitral and aortic ones. In order to simulate aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation (MR), special mechanical devices have been developed and integrated with the HCS. The simulation results proved that the system works correctly. Namely, in the case of AS − the mean pulmonary arterial pressure was increased due to increased preload of the left ventricle and the decrease in right ventricular preload was caused by a decrease in systemic arterial pressure. The severity of AS was performed based on the transaortic pressure gradient as well as using the Gorlin and Aaslid equations. In the case of severe AS, when the mean gradient was above 40 mmHg, the aortic valve orifice area was 0.5 cm2, which is in line with ACC/AHA guidelines. For the case of MR − with increasing severity of MR, there was a decrease in the left ventricular pressure and an increase in left atrial pressure. Using mechanical heart valves to simulate VHD by the HCS can be a valuable tool for biomedical research, providing a safe and controlled environment to study and understand the pathophysiology of VHD."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

It is shown, among other things, that by appropriately selecting the parameters of the electrospinning process, the thickness of fibers can be controlled, resulting in nonwovens with a desired morphology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

In this chapter, after an introductory section (Sect. 15.1), we examine how the Higuchi fractal dimension is able to perceive physiological processes (15.2), neurological (15.3) and psychiatric (15.4) disorders, and neuromodulation effects (15.5), giving a mention of other methods of measuring neuronal electrical activity in addition to electroencephalography, such as magnetoencephalography and functional magnetic resonance. Conscious that further progress will support a deeper understanding of the temporal course of neuronal activity because of continuous interaction with the environment, we conclude confident that the fractal dimension has begun to uncover important features of the physiology of brain activity and its alterations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Glassy carbon electrode was covered with polyazulene ion-to-electron transducing layer, which ensured improved stability of the prepared sensor. The sensor’s selectivity was obtained by applying NH4+-selective membrane on the transducing layer, which was further biofunctionalized with urease via covalent immobilization. The immobilized urease served as an auxiliary enzyme in the arginase-urease coupled enzyme assay. Thanks to obtained high stability (low drift coefficient ∼ 0.9 mV/h) and short response time (36 s), the developed urea biosensor enabled continuous monitoring the coupled enzyme reactions indirectly, through measurement the ammonium ion concentration. Arginase activity and Michaelis-Menten constant for arginine-arginase pair under defined experimental conditions, in particular constant concentration of manganese ions, was determined. Mathematical description of the coupled enzyme reactions kinetics is discussed and used to analyse the reactions with auxiliary enzyme immobilized on the electrode surface. The proposed method of determining arginase activity with use of highly stable potentiometric urease-based biosensor, allows obtaining results in the units of absolute arginase activity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

The prepared microspheres suspension in GelMA/gelatin bioink was successfully bioprinted and subjected to various tests, which showed that the addition of microspheres and their type affects the physicochemical properties of the printouts. The hydrogel stability and structure was examined using scanning electron and optical microscopy, its thermal properties with differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis and its biocompatibility on HaCaT cells using viability assay and electron microscopy. Analyses also included tests of hydrogel equilibrium swelling ratio and release of marker substance. Subsequently, the matrices were loaded with ampicillin and the antibiotic release was validated by monitoring the antibacterial activity on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.

It is assumed that molecules of essentially different sizes dissolved in fluid and are transported through pores of different sizes. The stress tensor, the main force leading to the material deformation, is taken not only in the standard linear form but also with an additional nonlinear part. The model is constructed in 1D space and consists of five nonlinear equations. It is shown that the governing equations are integrable in stationary case, therefore all steady-state solutions are constructed. The obtained solutions are used in an example for healthy and tumour tissue, in particular, tissue displacements are calculated and compared for parameters taken from experimental data in cases of the linear and nonlinear stress tensors. Since the governing equations are non-integrable in non-stationary case, the Lie symmetry analysis is used in order to construct time-dependent exact solutions. Depending on parameters arising in the governing equations, several special cases with non-trivial Lie symmetries are identified. As a result, multiparameter families of exact solutions are constructed including those in terms of special functions(hypergeometric and Bessel functions). A possible application of the solutions obtained is demonstrated."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Details of the physiologic forces, the distributed nature of the barrier, the effects of the interstitial matrix on transport, the nature of the endothelial barrier, the effects of lymphatic absorption from the tissue, and the factors of hydrostatic pressure and the surface area are discussed. Then we relate this to the basic clinical model and demonstrate the connections between the fundamental calculations of the process and those used to characterize the clinical situation. Alternative theories of transperitoneal transport are presented and related to the fundamental principles.\n\nIn the second part, recent research is reviewed concerning the molecular signals that occur when a catheter is introduced into the peritoneal cavity and dialysis solutions are administered. There has been a plethora of research concerning the inflammatory signals that may be involved in these processes and in possible ways to prevent the harmful effects. The focus will be on both theoretical and practical ways to slow or halt the changes that often force our patients to switch to hemodialysis.

We aimed to determine an optimal screening schedule for the US population and its dependencies on the objective of screening (life years gained or incidence, mortality, or cost reduction) and the setting in which screening is performed. We used our established open-source microsimulation model CMOST to calculate optimized colonoscopy schedules with one, two, three or four screening colonoscopies between 20 and 90 years of age. A single screening colonoscopy was most effective in reducing life years lost from CRC when performed at 55 years of age. Two, three and four screening colonoscopy schedules saved a maximum number of life years when performed between 49–64 years; 44–69 years; and 40–72 years; respectively. However, for maximum incidence and mortality reduction, screening colonoscopies needed to be scheduled 4–8 years later in life. The optimum was also influenced by adenoma detection efficiency with lower values for these parameters favoring a later starting age of screening. Low adherence to screening consistently favored a later start and an earlier end of screening. In a personalized approach, optimal screening would start earlier for high-risk patients and later for low-risk individuals. In conclusion, our microsimulation-based approach supports colonoscopy screening schedule between 45 and 75 years of age but the precise timing depends on the objective of screening, as well as assumptions regarding individual CRC risk, efficiency of adenoma detection during colonoscopy and adherence to screening."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

An automated medium replacement system was developed. The control cultures remained static. The analysis included cell viability via cytometric analysis, glucose consumption, lactate production via electroenzymatic methods, and the expression of 21 genes via qPCR. The percentage of apoptotic cells did not significantly differ across glucose concentrations under LSS. HUVECs favor glycolysis for energy regardless of LSS. Under LSS, the IL1B, CCL2, and SELE genes were upregulated under high-glucose conditions and downregulated under variable-glucose conditions. A few other genes related to inflammation, oxidative stress, cell adhesion and apoptosis were upregulated under high-glucose conditions. In conclusion, using the blood vessel model we effectively examined the impact of glucose profiles on HUVECs under LSS in a device replicating the cylindrical geometry of blood vessels.

We investigated scenarios where one icodextrin-based long dwell (Extraneal) replaced two glucose-based exchanges.\n\nMethods: The three-pore model with icodextrin hydrolysis was used for numerical simulations of a single exchange to investigate the impact of different peritoneal dialysis schedules on fluid and solute removal in patients with different peritoneal solute transfer rates (PSTRs). We evaluated water removal (ultrafiltration, UF), absorbed mass of glucose (AbsGluc) and carbohydrates (AbsCHO, for glucose and glucose polymers), ultrafiltration efficiency (UFE = UF/AbsCHO) per exchange, and specified dwell time, and removed solute mass for sodium (ReNa), urea (ReU), and creatinine (ReCr) for a single peritoneal exchange with 7.5% icodextrin (Extraneal®) and glucose-based solutions (1.36% and 2.27%) and various dwell durations in patients with fast and average PSTRs.\n\nResults: Introducing 7.5% icodextrin for the long dwell to replace one of three or four glucose-based exchanges per day leads to increased fluid and solute removal and higher UF efficiency for studied transport groups. Replacing two glucose-based exchanges with one icodextrin exchange provides higher or similar water removal and higher daily sodium removal but slightly lower daily removal of urea and creatinine, irrespective of the transport type present in the case of reference prescription with three and four daily exchanges.\n\nConclusion: One 7.5% icodextrin can replace two glucose solutions. Unlike glucose-based solutions, it resulted only in minor differences between PSTR groups in terms of water and solute removal with UFE remaining stable up to 16 h."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

The absence of therapeutic targets for traditional therapies is a hindrance to establishing a standardised therapy for TNBC. There is limited TNBCs epidemiological and real-world data about TNBC treatment regimens in Poland. We retrospectively analysed clinical data from our hospital registry from 2015 and 2020. A total of 8103 individuals with breast cancer were admitted to the MSCI, while 856 (10.6%) were diagnosed with TNBC. Most of the early-stage or locally advanced TNBC individuals had underlying conditions, presented mostly poorly differentiated (G3) stage II tumours and featured a bi-modal age distribution. On average, one-third of all tested TNBCs carried BRCA mutations and its identification impacted surgery preference. We observed a significant increase in the use of systemic therapy among TNBCs, whereas carboplatin and dose-dense regimens showed the most prominent upsurge in the neoadjuvant setting.

Besides the tsunami of mental health issues, there are limitations imposed by ambiguous clinical rules of assessment of the symptoms and obsolete and inefficient standard therapy approaches. Here we are summarizing the neuroimaging results pointing out the actual complexity of the disease and novel attempts to detect depression that are evidence-based, mostly related to electrophysiology. It is repeatedly shown that the complexity of resting-state EEG recorded in patients suffering from depression is increased compared to healthy controls. We are discussing here how that can be interpreted and what we can learn about future effective therapies. Also, there is evidence that novel options of treatment, like different modalities of electromagnetic stimulation, are successful just because they are capable of decreasing that aberrated complexity. And complexity measures extracted from electrophysiological signals of depression patients can serve as excellent features for further machine learning models in order to automatize detection. In addition, after initial detection and even selection of responders for further therapy route, it is possible to monitor the therapeutic flow for one person, which leads us to possible tailored treatment for patients suffering from depression."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Moreover, epithelization tissue in the third week of treatment exhibited the presence of keratinocytes. A 100% wound reduction was observed between 3 and 4 weeks of treatment with the modified dressing.

Fluid shifts across the extracellular compartments during UF, predominantly across the capillary interface and between the macro- and microcirculation. A mismatch between UF and transcapillary fluid transport can lead to hemodynamic instability leading to cardiac morbidity. We wished to study intradialytic fluid transport characteristics and their variation during UF to identify factors that govern variability in transcapillary fluid movement in HD.\n\nMethods: Twenty-two patients undergoing stable HD sessions were studied to measure and monitor absolute blood and plasma volume throughout UF. A computational mathematical model of predicted plasma volume decay during UF was analyzed with respect to the intradialytic real-time data profile. Pre- and post-dialysis fluid status was assessed using multifrequency bioimpedance spectroscopy. Serum electrolytes, osmolality, and total protein concentration were measured pre- and post-dialysis and during the intradialytic phase.\n\nResults: Two distinct profiles of PV responses were detected. 60% of the patients presented plasma volume decline, characterized by a high percentage of volume decrease during the first hour, and a subsequent slower decrease with early rebound. The model was modified to achieve a proper fit of these volume profiles, assuming time-dependent changes in selected parameters governing the refilling flow.\n\nConclusions: Although the modified model could more accurately fit the data, the new parameter values often fell outside of a physiologically acceptable range, suggesting that other factors not included in the classic description of transcapillary fluid transport might be the cause of the observed patterns."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

(2) Methods: A polyelectrolyte layer coating that incorporated copper nanoparticles was designed. As a bacteriostatic factor, copper nanoparticles were applied as a colloidal solution of copper nanoparticles (ColloidCuNPs) and a solution of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs). The influence of the polyelectrolytes on selected Gram (+) and Gram (−) strains was examined. The function and morphology of the human adenocarcinoma A549 cell line, comprising human epithelial lung cells cultured in the presence of nanocomposite layer coatings, were evaluated. We applied fluorescence and scanning electron microscopies, as well as flow cytometry, for these studies. Furthermore, the layer coating material was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). (3) Results: It was observed that the polyelectrolytes polyethyleneimine (PEI) and poly-L-lysine (PLL) did not induce proliferation of the E. coli strain. However, they did induce the proliferation of the S. aureus strain. Due to the effectiveness of the CuNPs against the E. coli strain, CuNPs were selected for further research. The designed coatings of proper NPs shared the sustained function of human lung cells within 10 days of culture. The AFM and EDX characterization confirmed the presence of copper in the layer coating nanomaterial. The presence of CuNPs in polyethyleneimine-based nanocomposite deepened the bacteriostatic effect on E. coli compared with PEI alone. Meanwhile, incorporating CuNPs in PLL allowed A549 cell maintenance but did not exert a bacteriostatic influence on the examined strain. (4) Conclusions: The platform based on polyelectrolytes, incorporated with copper nanoparticles, that ensures the growth and appropriate morphology of the human lung epithelial cells, might be considered an element of a system for medical devices used to maintain the function of human lung cells."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Due to the risk of environmental hazards, the mechanisms of AgNPs\ntoxicity should be thoroughly investigated to deepen our understanding of the potential negative impact on human health.\nAs oxidative stress (OS) is known to be one of the major mechanisms of AgNP-induced toxicity, in the present study, we\nhave evaluated OS-related changes in cytotoxicity parameters in AgNP-treated cerebellar granule cells (CGCs), as well as\nthe effectiveness of antioxidant defence systems, such as glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutases (SOD1 and SOD2)\nand catalase. The results indicate that exposure of CGCs to AgNPs decreases cell viability and mitochondrial potential\nand increases intracellular calcium concentration and free radical production. The level of intracellular GSH significantly\ndecreases in cells after short-term exposure, but overexpression of SOD1 is observed. In contrast, after long-term exposure,\ncatalase activity is substantially reduced. Supplying extracellular GSH prior to AgNPs significantly improved cell survival\nand reversed most of the changes in the investigated parameters.

Epilepsy is a disease characterized by abnormal paroxysmal bioelectrical activity in the brain cortex and subcortical structures. Seizures per se change brain metabolism in epileptic focus and in distal parts of the brain. However, interictal phenomena can also affect functional connectivity (FC) and brain metabolism in other parts of the brain.\n\nAim of study. We hypothesised that epilepsy affects functional connectivity not only among cortical, but also between subcortical, structures of the brain in a resting state condition.\n\nClinical rationale for study. Investigating functional connectivity in patients with epilepsy could provide insights into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Better understanding may lead to more effective treatment strategies.\n\nMaterial and methods. Functional connectivity was analysed in 35 patients with epilepsy and in 28 healthy volunteers. The group of patients was divided into generalised and focal epilepsy (temporal and extratemporal subgroups). Each patient and healthy volunteer underwent an fMRI resting-state session. During the study, EEG signals were simultaneously recorded with fMRI to facilitate the subsequent detection of potential interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Their potential impact on BOLD signals was mitigated through linear regression. The data was processed and correlation coefficients (FC values) between the BOLD signal from selected structures of the central nervous system were determined and compared between study groups. The results were presented as significant differences in correlation coefficients between brain/subcortical structures in the epilepsy and control groups.\n\nResults. Lower FC values for the epilepsy group compared to the control group were shown for connections related to the MPFC, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, and the parahippocampal gyrus.\n\nConclusions. Epilepsy alters the functional connectivity of resting state subcortical networks. Patterns of pathological changes of FC differ between epilepsy subtypes, with predominant lower FC between the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala and thalamus in patients with epilepsy.\n\nClinical implications. This study suggests that epilepsy affects subcortical structures. Identifying distinct patterns of altered FC in epilepsy subtypes may help to tailor treatment strategies. Changes in FC detected by fMRI may precede clinical symptoms, aiding in the early diagnosis of cognitive and emotional disorders in focal epilepsy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

However, the limited availability of transplantable organs has spurred research into alternative therapies, including bioartificial livers. To date, liver hybrid support devices, using porcine hepatocytes or hepatoma-derived cell lines, have failed to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials.\nHere, for the first time, we report the construction of a model of biologically active function block of bioartificial liver based on a hollow fiber bioreactor populated with genetically modified hepatic cells. For comprehensive comparison the culturing of hepatic cells was carried out in both static and dynamic conditions in a medium that flowed through porous polysulfone capillaries.

Blood acid–base and uremic solute concentration were measured in twenty chronic HD patients during 4-h treatments with A) constant Dbic of 35 mmol/L; B) Dbic of 35 mmol/L then 30 mmol/L; and C) Dbic of 30 mmol/L then 35 mmol/L (change of Dbic after two hours during Treatments B and C). Arterial blood samples were obtained predialysis, every hour during HD and one hour after HD, during second and third treatments of the week with each Dbic concentration profile. Blood bicarbonate concentration (blood [HCO3]) during Treatment C was lower only during the first three HD hours than in Treatment A. Overall blood [HCO3] was reduced during Treatment B in comparison to Treatment A at each time points.

The present studies, aimed at detecting changes in the levels of hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolites,\nwere carried out on 1-month-old rats belonging to the abovementioned two ASD models and on a control group. Analysis of\nboth hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolite levels gives a broader view of possible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis\nof autism.

The aim of the study was to assess the association of individual and combined single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the rs6265 BDNF (Val66Met), rs397595 DAT (SLC6A3), and rs4680 COMT (Val158Met) genes with early‑onset of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Moreover, we assessed the association between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and the level of BDNF protein in the serum of patients with PD and controls. The study involved 163 patients with idiopathic PD divided into early onset (<55 years) and late‑onset (>55 years) groups and 91 healthy age‑matched people (Control). The SNP were determined using the TaqMan Real‑Time PCR method. Serum BDNF levels were determined by ELISA assay. The risk of developing early PD in people with the BDNF genotype AG increases threefold in comparison with the carriers of the BDNF genotype GG. In PD patients and healthy people with the BDNF genotypes AG and AA, a lower serum BDNF level was found compared to those with the BDNF genotype GG in both groups. The results of our study indicate that the presence of the Val66Met BDNF gene polymorphism is associated with reduced blood BDNF levels and an elevated risk of developing early‑onset PD. This effect appears to be more pronounced in men."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"608135d42467f0276870e0c9","name":"Instytut Nauk o Sporcie, Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im. J.

However, it is still unclear how individual predispositions, such as brain structure characteristics, play a role in the process of acquiring new skills, such as video games. The aim of this preliminary study was to investigate whether acquisition of cognitive-motor skills from the real-time strategy video game (StarCraft II) is associated with pre-training measures of brain white matter integrity. Results show that higher white matter integrity in regions (anterior limb of internal capsule, cingulum/hippocampus) and tracts (inferior longitudinal fasciculus) related with motoric functions, set shifting and visual decision making was associated with better Star Craft II performance. The presented findings inline with previous results and suggest that structural brain predispositions of individuals are related to the video game skill acquisition. Our study highlights the importance of neuroimaging studies that focus on white matter in predicting the outcomes of intervention studies and has implications for understanding the neural basis of the skill learning process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

It shares with probainognathians more derived than Prozostrodon a mainly medially\noriented lesser trochanter and with the clade reuniting tritylodontids, brasilodontids, and\nmammaliaforms (but excluding tritheledontids) the presence of a projected femoral head,\noffset from the long axis of the femoral shaft; a thin, plate-like greater trochanter; a distinct\ndorsal eminence proximal to the medial (tibial) condyle located close to the level of the long\naxis of the femoral shaft and almost in the middle of the width of the distal expansion; and a\npocket-like fossa proximally to the medial (tibial) condyle. Saurodesmus robertsoni is most\nsimilar to tritylodontids, sharing at least with some forms: the relative mediolateral expansion\nof the proximal and distal regions of the femur, the general shape and development of the\ngreater trochanter, the presence of a faint intertrochanteric crest separating the shallow\nintertrochanteric and adductor fossae, and the general outline of the distal region as\nobserved dorsally and distally. This makes Saurodesmus robertsoni the first Triassic cyno-\ndont from Scotland and, possibly, one of the earliest representatives of tritylodontids and\none of the latest non-mammaliaform cynodonts worldwide. Moreover, it highlights the need\nfor revisiting historical problematic specimens, the identification of which could have been\npreviously hampered by the lack of adequate comparative materials in the past"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

role of NKCD56bright cells in monitoring the progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia during treatment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction.\nStandard treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has experienced a dramatic change over the last few years. Until recently, CLL was treated using chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Even though novel agents such as BTKi (Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor) and BCL2 inhibitors are the standard of care in most therapeutic settings, CIT still has its place in CLL treatment. Interestingly, little is known about its effects on the immune system of patients with CLL. Contrary to the reduction of the number of CLL cells during CIT administration, little attention has been paid to the cellular microenvironment, the evaluation of which during treatment may provide additional information about the course of the disease and prognosis and therefore was set as the aim of this study.\nMaterial and methods.\nFlow cytometry was used to evaluate the phenotypes of different populations and subpopulations of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (PB) of 20 patients with CLL before, during, and after CIT.\nResults.\nDuring the CIT with R-FC (Rituximab, Fludarabine, and Cyclophosphamide) and R-B (Rituximab, Bendamustine) regimens, the sizes of the assessed populations and subpopulations of lymphocytes were dramatically reduced. Twenty-eight days after the first course of treatment, the exponential decrease of CLL cells was observed, and their number had declined to the median level of 10% of the numbers observed before the treatment. T cells, NK cells, NKCD56dim, NKT-like, and NKT-like CD56dim also decreased exponentially. After the second treatment course, a decline in the numbers of T, NK, NKCD56dim, NKT-like, and NKT-like CD56dim cells was observed, which were stable until the sixth treatment course. However, the number of NKT-like CD56bright cells decreased to the third course of treatment and then increased. The number of CLL cells in peripheral blood correlated with the number of NKCD56bright cells, influencing the treatment response.\nConclusions.\nUpon CIT, the reduction of CLL cells is accompanied by shifts in immune cell populations, T, NK, and NKT-like cells. Monitoring changes of those cell populations in the peripheral blood may serve as an important predictive and prognostic indicator."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

However, some children present a pathological intracranial pressure (ICP) characterized by quantitative and qualitative alterations (the so-called B-waves) that can lead to neurological sequelae.\nAim\n\nOur purpose was to evaluate whether there were cerebral hemodynamic changes associated with ICP B-waves that could be evaluated with noninvasive neuromonitoring.\nApproach\n\nWe recruited eleven patients (median age 16 months, range 7 to 55 months) with BEH and an unfavorable evolution requiring ICP monitoring. Bedside, nocturnal monitoring using near-infrared time-resolved and diffuse correlation spectroscopies synchronized to the clinical monitoring was performed.\nResults\n\nBy focusing on the timing of different ICP patterns that were identified manually by clinicians, we detected significant tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) changes (p = 0.002) and blood flow index (BFI) variability (p = 0.005) between regular and high-amplitude B-wave patterns. A blinded analysis looking for analogs of ICP patterns in BFI time traces achieved 90% sensitivity in identifying B-waves and 76% specificity in detecting the regular patterns.\nConclusions\n\nWe revealed the presence of StO2 and BFI variations—detectable with optical techniques—during ICP B-waves in BEH children. Finally, the feasibility of detecting ICP B-waves in hemodynamic time traces obtained noninvasively was shown."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

performance assessment of diffuse optics instruments: the BitMap exercise","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Significance: Multi-laboratory initiatives are essential in performance assessment and standardization—crucial for bringing biophotonics to mature clinical use—to establish protocols and develop reference tissue phantoms that all will allow universal instrument comparison.\n\nAim: The largest multi-laboratory comparison of performance assessment in near-infrared diffuse optics is presented, involving 28 instruments and 12 institutions on a total of eight experiments based on three consolidated protocols (BIP, MEDPHOT, and NEUROPT) as implemented on three kits of tissue phantoms. A total of 20 synthetic indicators were extracted from the dataset, some of them defined here anew.\n\nApproach: The exercise stems from the Innovative Training Network BitMap funded by the European Commission and expanded to include other European laboratories. A large variety of diffuse optics instruments were considered, based on different approaches (time domain/frequency domain/continuous wave), at various stages of maturity and designed for different applications (e.g., oximetry, spectroscopy, and imaging).\n\nResults: This study highlights a substantial difference in hardware performances (e.g., nine decades in responsivity, four decades in dark count rate, and one decade in temporal resolution). Agreement in the estimates of homogeneous optical properties was within 12% of the median value for half of the systems, with a temporal stability of <5  %   over 1 h, and day-to-day reproducibility of <3  %  .

However, the original iNIRS technique uses single-mode fibers for light collection, which reduces the detected light throughput. The reduced light throughput is compensated by the relatively long measurement or integration times (∼1 sec), which preclude monitoring of rapid blood flow changes that could be linked to neural activation. Here, we propose parallel interferometric near-infrared spectroscopy (πNIRS) to overcome this limitation. In πNIRS we use multi-mode fibers for light collection and a high-speed, two-dimensional camera for light detection. Each camera pixel acts effectively as a single iNIRS channel. So, the processed signals from each pixel are spatially averaged to reduce the overall integration time. Moreover, interferometric detection provides us with the unique capability of accessing complex information (amplitude and phase) about the light remitted from the sample, which with more than 8000 parallel channels, enabled us to sense the cerebral blood flow with only a 10 msec integration time (∼100x faster than conventional iNIRS). In this report, we have described the theoretical foundations and possible ways to implement πNIRS. Then, we developed a prototype continuous wave (CW) πNIRS system and validated it in liquid phantoms. We used our CW πNIRS to monitor the pulsatile blood flow in a human forearm in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that CW πNIRS could monitor activation of the prefrontal cortex by recording the change in blood flow in the forehead of the subject while he was reading an unknown text."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebee4f2752340254fc447c1","5e7092c3878c28a04739c372"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

For tissues that have layered structures,\nit is challenging but clinically relevant to obtain StO2 of the different layers, e.g. brain and scalp.\nFor this aim, we present a new method of data analysis for time-domain NIRS (TD-NIRS) and a\nnew two-layered blood-lipid phantom. The new analysis method enables accurate determination\nof even large changes of the absorption coefficient (∆μa) in multiple layers. By adding ∆μa\nto the baseline μa, this method provides absolute μa and hence StO2 in multiple layers. The\nmethod utilizes (i) changes in statistical moments of the distributions of times of flight of photons\n(DTOFs), (ii) an analytical solution of the diffusion equation for an N-layered medium, (iii) and\nthe Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA) to determine ∆μa in multiple layers from the changes\nin moments. The method is suitable for NIRS tissue oximetry (relying on μa) as well as functional\nNIRS (fNIRS) applications (relying on ∆μa). Experiments were conducted on a new phantom,\nwhich enabled us to simulate dynamic StO2 changes in two layers for the first time. Two separate\ncompartments, which mimic superficial and deep layers, hold blood-lipid mixtures that can be\ndeoxygenated (using yeast) and oxygenated (by bubbling oxygen) independently. Simultaneous\nNIRS measurements can be performed on the two-layered medium (variable superficial layer\nthickness, L), the deep (homogeneous), and/or the superficial (homogeneous). In two experiments\ninvolving ink, we increased the nominal μa in one of two compartments from 0.05 to 0.25 cm−1,\nL set to 14.5 mm. In three experiments involving blood (L set to 12, 15, or 17 mm), we\nused a protocol consisting of six deoxygenation cycles. A state-of-the-art multi-wavelength\nTD-NIRS system measured simultaneously on the two-layered medium, as well as on the deep\ncompartment for a reference. The new method accurately determined μa (and hence StO2) in\nboth compartments. The method is a significant progress in overcoming the contamination from\nthe superficial layer, which is beneficial for NIRS and fNIRS applications, and may improve the\ndetermination of StO2 in the brain from measurements on the head.

Novel hybrid nanoflowers based on bovine serum albumin (BSA) and hydroxyapatite (HA) were obtained and characterized. Study on BSA-HA nanoflowers as potential drug delivery system is reported for the first time. Methods: Embedding ciprofloxacin in the structure of hybrid nanoflowers was confirmed by ATR-FTIR and thermogravimetric analysis. The inorganic phase of the nanoflowers was determined by X-ray diffraction. UV‒Vis spectroscopy was used to evaluate the release profiles of ciprofloxacin from nanoflowers in buffer solutions at pH 7.4 and 5. The agar disk diffusion method was used to study the antibacterial activity of the synthesized nanoflowers against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results: Bovine serum albumin – hydroxyapatite nanoflowers were obtained with diameters of ca. 1–2 µm. The kinetics of ciprofloxacin release from nanoflowers were described by the Korsmeyer-Peppas model. The antibacterial activity of the synthesized nanoflowers was demonstrated against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, two main pathogens found in osteomyelitis. Conclusion: The formulated nanoflowers may act as an efficient local antibiotic delivery system. Due to the use of nonhazardous, biodegradable components and benign synthesis, hybrid nanoflowers are very promising drug delivery systems that could be applied in the treatment of skeletal system infections."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b6878c28a0473af945"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

The main objective of the investigation is to validate theoretically calculated sensitivity profiles for a measurement geometry with two detectors and two sources in which sensitivity profiles of statistical moments of distributions of time of flight of photons (DTOFs) are spatially restricted to a region underneath the detectors. For this dual subtraction method, smaller sensitivities to changes appearing in the superficial layer of the medium were observed compared to the single distance and single subtraction methods. Experimental validation of this approach is based on evaluation of changes in the statistical moments of DTOFs measured on a liquid phantom with local absorption perturbations. The spatial distributions of sensitivities, depth-related sensitivity and depth selectivities were obtained from the dual subtraction method and compared with those from single distance and single subtraction approaches. Also, the contrast to noise ratio (CNR) was calculated for the dual subtraction technique and combined with depth selectivity in order to assess the overall performance (product of CNR and depth selectivity) of the method. Spatial sensitivity profiles from phantom experiments are in a good agreement with the results of theoretical studies and feature more locally restricted sensitivity volume with the point of maximal sensitivity located deeper. The highest value of overall performance was obtained experimentally for the second statistical moment in the dual subtraction method (∼10.8) surpassing that of the single distance method (∼8.7). This confirms the advantage of dual subtraction measurement geometries in the suppression of optical signals originated in the superficial layer of the medium."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Besides the limitations due to the physics of continuous-wave light sources, one culprit is the head heterogeneity and the underlying morphological and functional abnormalities of the probed tissue.\nAim\n\nThe aim is to investigate the effect that different tissue alterations in the damaged head have on DO signals and provide guidelines to avoid data misinterpretation.\nApproach\n\nDO measurements and computed tomography scans were acquired on brain-injured patients. The relationship between the signals and the underlying tissue types was classified on a case-by-case basis.\nResults\n\nExamples and suggestions to establish quality control routines were provided. The findings suggested guidelines for carrying out DO measurements and speculations toward improved devices.\nConclusions\n\nWe advocate for the standardization of the DO measurements to secure a role for DO in neurocritical care. We suggest that blind measurements are unacceptably problematic due to confounding effects and care using a priori and a posteriori quality control routines that go beyond an assessment of the signal-to-noise ratio that is typically utilized."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

In this research we evaluate the performance of the td-DCS technique at three SDSs of 1.5, 2 and 2.5 cm to recover cerebral blood flow (CBF). To do that we presented comprehensive characterization of the td-DCS system through a series of phantom experiments. First by quality metrices such as coefficient of variation and contrast-to-noise ratios, we identified optimal time gate(s) of the TOF to extract dynamics of particles. Then using sensitivity metrices, each SDS ability to detect dynamics of particles in superficial and deeper layer was evaluated. Finally, td-DCS at each SDS was tested on healthy volunteers during cuff occlusion test and breathing tasks. According to phantom measurements, the sensitivity to estimate perfusion within the deep layer located at depth of 1.5 cm from the surface can be increased more than two times when the SDS increases from 1.5 cm to 2.5 cm."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Although many new compounds have been tested recently, only a few have been approved for treatment. Of the several new drugs recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), only edaravone (marketed under the trade name Radicava) has been shown to be safe, but its effectiveness was limited to patients with a disease duration of less than 2 years. This was not surprising, since it is well known that in most diseases, the timing of treatment is crucial to its effectiveness. Unfortunately, it is also known that ALS begins long before a patient experiences the first symptoms of the disease. The results of clinical trials of edaravone suggest that if the ALS phenotype could be detected early enough, treatment could more effectively delay disease progression. Moreover, this may also apply to other drugs that are currently less effective. However, defining the appropriate therapeutic window for a disease that does not manifest itself until half of the MNs have degenerated is a major challenge. There is therefore an urgent need for appropriate biomarkers that can be used to diagnose the presymptomatic stage of ALS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

However, the current non-invasive monitoring methods available in clinics lack the necessary sensitivity and/or are impractical for large-scale deployment. As a step towards proposing a new modality, we applied the first platform, to our knowledge, designed to do simultaneous measurements of neck anatomy and thyroid microvascular hemodynamics and metabolism in a single probe placement, integrating state-of-the-art near-infrared spectroscopy techniques and clinical ultrasound. A rich dataset was formed with sixty-five subjects (forty-eight females), including eighteen healthy volunteers and forty-seven patients with thyroid nodules, characterizing thyroid tissue and the effects of demographic and anatomical variables while preserving the standard clinical workflow. We have found marked reductions with age and body mass index in thyroid total hemoglobin concentration (THC), tissue oxygen saturation (StO2), and blood flow index (BFi), among others. Patients showed lower THC and BFi than healthy subjects, and the limited sample of malignant nodules showed a higher StO2 than the benign. These findings support the need for personalized clinical approaches."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.
