Therefore, issues related to the development and transformation of such areas attract increasing interest. No complex classification of paraglacial coasts has been presented so far. The main aim of this study was the determination of the mutual relations and evolution of paraglacial coasts in a systemic approach (paraglacial, proglacial, periglacial) based on the example of Recherchefjorden (Svalbard). Classification of coasts based on geomorphological mapping of the coasts of Recherchefjorden has been developed in terms of the lithology of sediments, genetic origins of hinterland, morphology, and morphodynamics. Analyses of field data and archival materials permitted the preparation of a model of the evolution of six main groups of coasts. Three groups were designated, characteristic of each of the glacial and paraglacial, and periglacial landscape and conditions causing transitions between particular types of coasts were determined. Due to the comprehensive and universal characteristics used in the development of the scheme and the representative landscapes of the Recherchefjorden region, the classification of High Arctic rock coasts presented here is readily transferable to other regions, potentially facilitating future research, management, and modeling of paraglacial areas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918e878c28a04737e44c","uid":"bOsTJEvmlvq1TPV2NgBPXuw","uuid":"75fdfd10-8c3b-4407-8102-72c611142d0e","name":"Wydział Nauk o Ziemi i Gospodarki Przestrzennej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f8878c28a0473a044e","5e7092f8878c28a0473a043b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af532"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"112","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-22","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60a4d5882467f03fde375552","5e7092f8878c28a0473a043b","60a4d5882467f03fde375554","5e7092f8878c28a0473a044e","60a4d5882467f03fde375555","5e7093b2878c28a0473af532"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b9a5","mniswId":"1297","title":"Annals of the American Association of Geographers","issn":"2469-4452","eissn":"2469-4460","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"2e8c7836-f93a-4a84-8edd-0148170b33a8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bbe7ef40970754861bf005","year":"2022","volume":"1","number":"112","doi":"","documentHash":"e85d3eed-3f95-4906-96c3-5f9e1b3b6300"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["coastal classification","coastal evolution","paraglacial coast","Recherchefjorden","Svalbard"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747051303277"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6197508a2467f02124c32d92","name":"Agnes","lastName":"Kontny","documentHash":"3de494d5-7db8-4a1e-bad2-79f11d2cd77b"},{"objectId":"6197508a2467f02124c32d91","name":"Boris","lastName":"Reznik","documentHash":"810c611a-0414-4b73-88e8-7993f8dc31f3"},{"objectId":"6197508a2467f02124c32d90","name":"Ralf","lastName":"Krumholz","documentHash":"938e3e0a-f78f-4fec-8bbf-814b1d818905"},{"objectId":"6197508a2467f02124c32d8f","name":"Mario","lastName":"Walter","documentHash":"6f581da2-7e8e-4b6d-9c8c-8d05114ed0d8"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3d37","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dudzisz","uuid":"CB8A56D218873215B0E6A697AEF6BDB67E77A2E5004D09D5FE340B63B5E950B6C9AC075B91A33D58B125890908C1F1302B868364040EFD8E73C894FB75E36692","orcidId":"0000-0002-2503-451X","documentHash":"4b3ca7e2-cc85-4331-9dd3-51c0a79c35b6"}],"objectId":"6197508a2467f02124c32d8c","doi":"10.1093/gji/ggab400","publicUri":"http://academic.oup.com/gji/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/gji/ggab400/40510658/ggab400.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of cyclic loading at elevated temperatures on the magnetic susceptibility of a magnetite-bearing ore","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cyclic loading at elevated temperatures occurs either naturally during tectonic or volcanic-induced earthquakes or can be human-induced due to various geological engineering activities. The aim of this study is to test if mechanical fatigue in rocks can be monitored by magnetic methods. For this purpose, the effect of cyclic-mechanical loading (150 ± 30 MPa) on the magnetic susceptibility and its anisotropy of a magnetite-bearing ore with varying temperatures (400 and 500 °C) and environment (air and vacuum) was investigated. Our study shows that magnetic susceptibility decreases significantly (up to 23 per cent) under air conditions and in vacuum (up to 4 per cent) within the first ca. 1000 cycles. Further loading does not significantly affect the magnetic susceptibility which then remains more or less constant. The decrease of susceptibility parameters is stronger at 500 °C compared to 400 °C under both experimental conditions. Magnetic susceptibility was always measured after decompression of the loaded sample at room temperature so that magnetostriction can be excluded as a reason for these changes. The higher the temperature at which samples were loaded the more pronounced is the oxidation of magnetite to haematite. The transformation of magnetite into haematite under ambient conditions is the most important mechanism influencing bulk magnetic properties. The weak changes in magnetic susceptibility after vacuum loadings are probably caused by intragranular microcracks formed on the surface of magnetite grains. These surface deformation structures are accompanied by the refinement of magnetic domains, which is observed by magnetic force microscopy. Bulk magnetic grain size modifications are also confirmed by hysteresis parameters as well as by the increasing Hopkinson peak ratios determined from magnetic susceptibility measurements over Curie point. The degree of magnetic anisotropy and shape factor only change for the air-treated samples and are therefore related to the haematite formation and not to irreversible ductile deformation in magnetite. Our experimental study shows that cyclic loading can change significantly the magnetic properties of a rock due to mineral transformation below < 1000 cycles and that the first stages of mechanical fatigue, which are a precursor of the failure of rock, are closely associated with these transformations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3d37"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"228","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"1346-1360","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709328878c28a0473a3d37","6197508a2467f02124c32d8f","6197508a2467f02124c32d90","6197508a2467f02124c32d91","6197508a2467f02124c32d92"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e1b","mniswId":"7138","title":"GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL","issn":"0956-540X","eissn":"1365-246X","documentHash":"c997c760-a0fe-4c68-8bae-cecdf9eec58d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6284de2940970712d1b695ff","year":"2022","volume":"228","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"4ef44c34-dfb1-48bf-b3c2-3bd7faf8b7a2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Magnetic properties, Magnetic fabrics and anisotropy, Microstructures"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747056732874"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61b1b6fd2467f0304b807a97","name":"Jean","lastName":"Virieux","documentHash":"fca75f7a-9d24-482f-bf89-984567cb5688"},{"objectId":"61b1b6fd2467f0304b807a95","name":"Ludovic","lastName":"Métivier","documentHash":"db832798-6e23-44c0-96c6-aeb61bcce44b"},{"objectId":"61b1b6fd2467f0304b807a90","name":"Romain","lastName":"Brossier","documentHash":"75bc0e2f-a36c-46ec-9d29-82e04bc0335a"},{"objectId":"61b1b6fd2467f0304b807a81","name":"Jian","lastName":"Cao","orcidId":"0000-0002-3133-8608","documentHash":"819699f7-67c7-4565-a398-abaaeca45e9b"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a0473989c9","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Górszczyk","uuid":"0A6AE9F1EC9A1C443C1601B910B3422E361203C041A5225F1AAF35894B9C2763A7BC803BACC3400B7D1931FDD885C2A176CCC58E5930BA848AE9C0703A7D0641","orcidId":"0000-0002-9767-2772","documentHash":"c13106bc-e029-46e2-a892-271c4a59eaa7"}],"objectId":"61b1b6fd2467f0304b807a7f","doi":"10.1093/gji/ggab484","publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/gji/ggab484/41363793/ggab484.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"3D multi-parameter full-waveform inversion for ocean-bottom seismic data using an efficient fluid-solid coupled spectral-element solver","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ocean-bottom seismic acquisition systems deployed on the seabed give access to three-component geophone data and hydrophone data. Compared with conventional streamer acquisitions, the separation of sources and receivers makes it possible to increase the maximum offset and azimuth coverage for improving the illumination at depth. Furthermore, the three-component geophones naturally capture elastic wave propagation effects. While this information is mostly overlooked up to now, reconstructing jointly P- and S-wave velocities would significantly improve the subsurface characterization. To achieve a 3D high-resolution multi-parameter reconstruction, we design an efficient 3D fluid-solid coupled full waveform modelling and inversion engine. In this engine, fluid and solid domains are divided explicitly and handled with the acoustic and elastic wave equations, respectively. The numerical implementation is based on a time-domain spectral-element method (SEM) with a flexible 3D Cartesian-based hexahedral mesh, which contributes to an accurate coupling of the acoustic and elastic wave equations and high computational efficiency through domain-decomposition based parallelization. We select the best acoustic-elastic coupled formulations among 4 possibilities with criteria based on numerical accuracy and implementation efficiency. Moreover, we propose a specific hybrid approach for the misfit gradient building so as to use a similar modelling solver for both forward and adjoint simulations. Synthetic case studies on a 3D extended Marmousi-II model and a 3D deep-water crustal-scale model illustrate how our modelling and inversion engine can efficiently extract information from ocean-bottom data to simultaneously reconstruct both P- and S-wave velocities within a full waveform inversion framework."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709297878c28a0473989c9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"229","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"671–703,","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61b1b6fd2467f0304b807a81","61b1b6fd2467f0304b807a90","5e709297878c28a0473989c9","61b1b6fd2467f0304b807a95","61b1b6fd2467f0304b807a97"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e1b","mniswId":"7138","title":"GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL","issn":"0956-540X","eissn":"1365-246X","documentHash":"c997c760-a0fe-4c68-8bae-cecdf9eec58d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"627a0e844097077f84ec2fab","year":"2022","volume":"229","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"fe79a990-8a85-482c-b5a3-a3ab376fad51"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Inverse theory, Waveform inversion, Computational seismology, Numerical modelling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747057265494"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","name":"Adam","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"864E3E49A2309C1FB479470AD68682EA3FAB4349A58557B0478C54157BBB2B92E9A4D1252BEC5AB9362F29E198D2892DA7519ED222E344D6630D3217C0FDAF82","orcidId":"0000-0003-0923-7314","documentHash":"25196237-6284-406e-a277-91b7ddef9871"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7de3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Piotrowska","uuid":"FBAE40D7319650E11C0335FA5D6AA1095965B08F4AD4DF082E1E05FD0FF22BE67CD6CC9F2E9E395A94A0570C621B182E6FFA1D8EE667ED711144DDA75303A79C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0375-1227","documentHash":"560ab5f6-23ff-45e8-86e6-0122de212bcd"}],"objectId":"61b3ad132467f0760bab5724","doi":"10.1007/s10462-021-10052-w","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10462-021-10052-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Differential evolution and particle swarm optimization against COVID-19","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"COVID-19 disease, which highly affected global life in 2020, led to a rapid scientific response.

In this paper a survey of DE and PSO applications for problems related with COVID-19 pandemic that were rapidly published in 2020 is presented from two different points of view: 1. practitioners seeking the appropriate method to solve particular problem, 2. experts in metaheuristics that are interested in methodological details, inter comparisons between different methods, and the ways for improvement. The effectiveness and popularity of DE and PSO is analyzed in the context of other metaheuristics used against COVID-19. It is found that in COVID-19 related studies: 1. DE and PSO are most frequently used for calibration of epidemiological models and image-based classification of patients or symptoms, but applications are versatile, even interconnecting the pandemic and humanities; 2. reporting on DE or PSO methodological details is often scarce, and the choices made are not necessarily appropriate for the particular algorithm or problem; 3. mainly the basic variants of DE and PSO that were proposed in the late XX century are applied, and research performed in recent two decades is rather ignored; 4. the number of citations and the availability of codes in various programming languages seems to be the main factors for choosing metaheuristics that are finally used."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1e","uid":"b-yrvkc3sVahSubiYepE95Q","uuid":"179cf2df-1469-45a3-bc52-103b2f4e9ca5","name":"Wydział Polonistyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7de3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942c878c28a0473b7920"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"55","pagesFromTo":"2149-2219","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","5e70935b878c28a0473a7de3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771e3","mniswId":"1820","title":"Artificial Intelligence Review","issn":"0269-2821","eissn":"1573-7462","documentHash":"fdf0f4bb-4aef-4b84-8add-d3e028e33c54"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a19ceb4097073ee8322e2f","year":"2022","volume":"","number":"55","doi":"","documentHash":"2f27149b-850c-4c1d-a882-e93ff702e4b1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Applications; COVID-19; Differential evolution; Evolutionary computation; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm intelligence."]}],"lastRefresh":"1747057289360"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094b0878c28a0473c1bc7","name":"Olga","lastName":"Zawadzka-Mańko","uuid":"E2848FC70B8C0DA0158BDFABDB2480F194629C8E521B6330D41FF2972C4DA331D4BE9D5A2565DA12B2E91653463E1204155827F65424716F55E596C1626AC03F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8751-3914","documentHash":"08d0be16-03ee-4945-9b06-77676ca152dc"},{"objectId":"5e709405878c28a0473b5090","name":"Michał","lastName":"Posyniak","uuid":"D700397288A9F23BF1CEB0F7DFA26EE5C37EB65EC190D37F00D13DB27179C8527E626071243108936E04E838BB0FB1CEE31E14BD31C457B346682F52E9D3A484","orcidId":"0000-0003-2156-9434","documentHash":"811c4d9c-de94-4c4b-88d1-0dfc9ef468b2"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7bd0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Markowicz","uuid":"AC239775D4B6CBB827F09663593D1256CFD20E3B246683DAC7990FF24302F8C989C5ECECCBF82C2CCEE9C312F5CAF3744230786ADB5C847184B2351833E1D528","orcidId":"0000-0003-4190-0243","documentHash":"0c6ea7a5-fec7-43f4-aca0-c49449c195c8"}],"objectId":"61b99ab52467f0239144b64c","doi":"10.1002/joc.7488","publicUri":"https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.7488","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A large reduction of direct aerosol cooling over Poland in the last decades","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents an analysis of the long-term (1982–2015) variability of aerosol optical properties, as well as aerosol and greenhouse gases (GHG) direct radiative forcing (RF) in central Europe on the basis of MERRA-2 reanalysis and ground-based observation. Calculations of longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) RF were made with the use of the off-line Fu-Liou radiative transfer model and were preceded by the sensitivity study of the code's input parameters. Then, the long-term mean as well as the annual variability for selected regions of aerosol optical properties and radiative forcing were analysed. The mean AOD trend was −0.056 ± 9% per decade and AOD was reduced by 48% between 1982 and 2015. While for 1982–1990 the trend per decade was −0.12 ± 20%, for 1991–2000 it was −0.17 ± 17% and only −0.02 ± 31% in the last 15 years (2001–2015). The trend of the aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) was 1.52 ± 0.12 W·m−2/10 year and 1.21 ± 0.19 W·m−2/10 year at top of the atmosphere (TOA) and at Earth's surface, respectively. The trend for GHG was significantly smaller and it equalled 0.27 ± 0.01 W·m−2/10 year at TOA and 0.17 ± 0.01 W·m−2/10 year at the surface. Changes in GHG and aerosol direct effect produced additional 3.2 ± 0.2 W·m−2 at TOA, which could be associated with the observed regional climate warming. The change of the direct aerosol effect was about 4 times the GHG RF. The influence of aerosol loading reduction on the radiation budget was significantly higher in the 1990s of the 20th century in comparison to the first decades of the 21st. The effect of aerosol reduction has significant impact on air temperature changes during warm season and negligible during winter."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709405878c28a0473b5090"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","name":"Wydział Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7bd0","5e7094b0878c28a0473c1bc7"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"42","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"4129-4146","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094b0878c28a0473c1bc7","5e709405878c28a0473b5090","5e709358878c28a0473a7bd0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547819c","mniswId":"8713","title":"International Journal of Climatology","issn":"0899-8418","eissn":"1097-0088","documentHash":"bbea15dc-1eb4-4cea-8857-4ea4e4328da3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"605317b52467f04a40ff2a5f","year":"2021","documentHash":"c7948a07-e77e-4a5d-a4af-d672b55b4625"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057416371"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"662a26c0409707626339c829","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Zawierucha","documentHash":"49f5e230-afe7-4876-b64b-665283af6dd4"},{"objectId":"662a26c0409707626339c827","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Klimaszyk","documentHash":"fd6739d5-45e3-4ecb-8336-b1a31930cf93"},{"objectId":"662a26c0409707626339c826","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Franzetti","documentHash":"bc235d09-0185-49c1-8744-b137af7e7250"},{"objectId":"662a26c0409707626339c825","name":"Elizabeth A.","lastName":"Bagshaw","documentHash":"9edde13a-af3e-4b48-93c8-d4bf6dade39e"},{"objectId":"662a26c0409707626339c824","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Ambrosini","documentHash":"a61a537f-ca2a-4c45-8e87-8a2a9f957803"},{"objectId":"662a26c0409707626339c823","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Rozwalak","documentHash":"a174fc9f-9c27-4d75-94d6-9f5851d07402"},{"objectId":"662a26c0409707626339c822","name":"Ewa A.","lastName":"Poniecka","documentHash":"17f8a702-c4e6-4f71-b238-afdf4483540c"},{"objectId":"662a26c0409707626339c821","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Buda","documentHash":"663c4b4b-7c06-43cc-a368-53dabbc25d61"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a23c8","name":"Adam","lastName":"Nawrot","uuid":"62E26EB8A7FD937B6F4EC478E5F86852F14D84281B3DDBE242AA1B58FF7741578B6ECC7A4C19192C210949FB912077FF7C3A914E35B207156C9A9722F02B6B1A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6619-6478","documentHash":"c0165202-67c7-4155-873c-b372458e73bc"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395f84","name":"Mirosława","lastName":"Pietryka","uuid":"1C33D44AFD7483D0DE60C998494A9F80EA2D432FBFAFFBB5E58D551F4B619060F13C706C24ECA515897469152FAC7CA5499E2DCAD842EAABC792381D3352E043","orcidId":"0000-0002-2796-6097","documentHash":"d68704cc-7bc7-4c2a-93e4-b5af1f5834b3"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e224","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Richter","uuid":"73B311BF33844FECEED813983B1B2365DE9BEE169C3D7139D6B9B2CFE5F3E974C7839B3BB5B77F79564E585B6E8D99508F1B8AA5F5617542D8EE796655DA8D8A","orcidId":"0000-0003-3024-9766","documentHash":"e87ed90d-aabf-442f-b73a-b9b0bc9427cd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"61c1e7fa2467f03fff4d259c","doi":"10.1007/s10021-021-00729-2","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10021-021-00729-2.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Is Oxygenation Related to the Decomposition of Organic Matter in Cryoconite Holes?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cryoconite is a sediment occurring on glacier surfaces worldwide which reduces ice albedo and concentrates glacier surface meltwater into small reservoirs called cryoconite holes. It consists of mineral and biogenic matter, including active microorganisms. This study presents an experimental insight into the influence of sediment oxygenation on the cryoconite ability to produce and decomposition of organic matter. Samples were collected from five glaciers in the Arctic and the European mainland. Cryoconite from three glaciers was incubated in stagnant and mechanically mixed conditions to imitate inter-hole water–sediment mixing by meltwater occurring on glaciers in Northern Hemisphere, and its effect on oxygen profiles and organic matter content. Moreover, we investigated short-term changes of oxygen conditions in cryoconite from four glaciers in illuminated and dark conditions. An anaerobic zone was present or approaching zero oxygen in all illuminated cryoconite samples, varying in depth depending on the origin of cryoconite: from 1500 µm from Steindalsbreen (Scandinavian Peninsula) and Forni Glacier (The Alps) to 3100 µm from Russell Glacier and Longyearbreen (Arctic) after incubation. Organic matter content varied between glaciers from 6.11% on Longyearbreen to 16.36% on Russell Glacier. The mixed sediment from the Forni Glacier had less organic matter than stagnant, the sediment from Longyearbreen followed this trend, but the difference was not statistically significant, while the sediment from Ebenferner did not differ between groups. Our results have implications for the understanding of biogeochemical processes on glacier surfaces, the adaptation of organisms to changing physical conditions due to abrupt sediment mixing, but also on the estimation of productivity of supraglacial systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e224","5e709274878c28a047395f84"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709310878c28a0473a23c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1510-1521","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709274878c28a047395f84","5e7091fc878c28a04738e224","662a26c0409707626339c821","662a26c0409707626339c822","662a26c0409707626339c823","662a26c0409707626339c824","662a26c0409707626339c825","662a26c0409707626339c826","662a26c0409707626339c827","5e709310878c28a0473a23c8","662a26c0409707626339c829"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a2e","mniswId":"5408","title":"Ecosystems","issn":"1432-9840","eissn":"1435-0629","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"de38e993-9b33-4dc3-a2dc-bef6ce44a965"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"663a062b4097077c1aa859b4","year":"2022","volume":"","number":"25","doi":"","documentHash":"ba42b5b1-4a66-49be-99ca-bcbaae55ec71"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aerobic","anaerobic","decay","glacier","photoautotrophs","supraglacial"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747057462474"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61d2cb292467f0718bff89d3","name":"Musa Adebayo","lastName":"Idris","documentHash":"7dc4d6af-a8e6-4f38-bc63-d4b2ce3db28a"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af539","name":"Beata","lastName":"Orlecka-Sikora","uuid":"05C232E225B92508A67E3CB3A26629C7F5FE6D6F78D547920033B0BA5768AD1CC1912FC2223767E5354F2AA14EE0974881A8A37C7952BC36AE274CCC6F9A4A00","orcidId":"0000-0002-0182-1455","documentHash":"dd7b93a1-d01a-4e00-bcec-bab626486cc5"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a047398a15","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Cielesta","uuid":"3160F677F9A5E748E3D799461E237F4F819A972838A37C5C70610BAB74D00BE52D730653FD02BADD3075DB4B52D0D6B79718D8F6FEE6C39D9E9ED33F02CA6809","orcidId":"0000-0002-2819-6127","documentHash":"7c9d1d49-6a9b-4284-905c-c5cf76f452d3"}],"objectId":"61d2cb292467f0718bff89cf","doi":"10.1007/s10706-021-02038-w","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10706-021-02038-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Rotation of the Stress Tensor in a Westerly Granite Sample During the Triaxial Compression Test","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We simulated the spatiotemporal modelling of 3D stress and strain distributions during the triaxial compression laboratory test on a westerly granite sample using finite-difference numerical modelling implemented with FLAC3D software. The modelling was performed using a ubiquitous joint constitutive law with strain softening. The applied procedure is capable of reproducing the macroscopic stress and strain evolution in the sample during triaxial deformation until a failure process occurs. In addition, we calculated focal mechanisms of acoustic emission (AE) events and resolved local stress field orientations. This detailed stress information was compared with that from numerical modelling. The comparison was made based on the 3D rotation angle between the cardinal axes of the two stress tensors. To infer the differences in rotation, we applied ANOVA. We identified the two time levels as the plastic deformation phase and the after-failure phase. Additionally, we introduced the bin factor, which describes the location of the rotation scores in the rock sample. The p values of the test statistics F for the bin and phase effects are statistically significant. However, the interaction between them is insignificant. We can, therefore, conclude that there was a significant difference in the time between the rotation means in the particular bins, and we ran post hoc tests to obtain more information where the differences between the groups lie. The largest rotation of the stress field provided by the focal mechanisms of AE events from the numerically calculated stress field is observed in the edge bins, which do not frame the damage zone of the sample."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

Structure of the East European Craton at the Transition from Sarmatia to Fennoscandia Interpreted from the TTZ-South Seismic Profile (SE Poland to

Investigation results reveal the upper lithospheric structure as representing the NW-vergent, NE-SW striking overthrust-type, Paleoproterozoic (~1.84–1.8 Ga) Fennoscandia-Sarmatia suture. The Sarmatian segment of the EEC comprises two crustal-scale tectonic thrust slices: the Moldavo-Podolian and Lublino-Volhynian basement units, overriding the northerly located Lysogoro-Radomian unit of Fennoscandian affinity. The combined results of the TTZ-South and other nearby deep seismic profiles are consistent with a continuation of the EEC cratonic basement across the TTZ to the SW and its plunging into the deep substratum of the adjacent Paleozoic platform. Extensional deformation responsible for the formation of the mid to late Proterozoic (~1.4–0.6 Ga), SW-NE trending Orsha-Volhynia rift basin is probably also recorded. The thick Ediacaran succession deposited in the rift was later tectonically thickened due to Variscan deformation. The Moho depth varies between 37 and 49 km, resulting in the thinnest crust in the SE, sharp depth changes across the TTZ, and slow shallowing from 49 to 43 km to the NW. The abrupt Moho depth increase from 43 to 49 km is considered to reflect the overlying lower crust tectonic duplication within the suture zone."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61efe1872467f031227ede3c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938d878c28a0473ac926","5e709439878c28a0473b875d","5e709439878c28a0473b875e","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba07a","5e70922e878c28a0473912de"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"112","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709439878c28a0473b875d","61efe1862467f031227ede21","5e70922e878c28a0473912de","61efe1862467f031227ede23","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04a","5e709439878c28a0473b875e","61efe1862467f031227ede26","61efe1862467f031227ede27","61efe1872467f031227ede28","61efe1872467f031227ede29","61efe1872467f031227ede2a","5e70938d878c28a0473ac926","61efe1872467f031227ede2c","61efe1872467f031227ede2d","5e70944d878c28a0473ba07a","61efe1872467f031227ede2f","61efe1872467f031227ede3c","61efe1872467f031227ede58","61efe1872467f031227ede64"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478ea0","mniswId":"14412","title":"Minerals","eissn":"2075-163X","documentHash":"9bb678cc-45b6-410c-97d7-92616192a9c5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61efe1872467f031227ede66","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"2","documentHash":"8a8270f8-9184-468a-87a6-58ca0025c9c9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058086461"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646e257b4097076e9c3ac2e6","name":"Paul Eric","lastName":"Aspholm","documentHash":"47ba3463-61ff-4f2c-bc48-aaa13d17590f"},{"objectId":"646e257b4097076e9c3ac2e4","name":"Hilde Karine","lastName":"Wam","documentHash":"696ec670-438d-4f19-b2dc-3060230db508"},{"objectId":"5e7094ef878c28a0473c7522","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Juńczyk","uuid":"7023B13FD939ACCA16A782827134AF380A28B8DAEC0B2B40DE00EA1AC061D6A605074D713F1688CEFC819FB8252965D07929D01FBBDCD84E102B7933DB48EA54","orcidId":"0000-0003-1664-0419","documentHash":"6ccd5797-261b-4590-b5df-4e5e7cc6a659"},{"objectId":"5e7094e7878c28a0473c6935","name":"Agata","lastName":"Goździk","uuid":"774A4CDBCDF6EBB376800A3FBFCC930394AE977968AE754F2BCC37930CF797D04317353729CECA125ACF18ACADC7A96050BAE3F21D8E136DADE488F3094F707B","orcidId":"0000-0002-9474-9500","documentHash":"148c7398-8145-46be-a8fe-ff7c5c51f816"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"62556eec2467f052bcab1256","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0266655","publicUri":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266655","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Democratizing education: Open schooling engaged the less privileged in environmental sciences","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Democratizing learning is essential for environmental sustainability. Less privileged areas are crucial in this regard. Informal education has great such potential, but often fails to reach the less privileged, and to document learning. With the objective to identify and counter these issues, we here report on EDU-ARCTIC, an informal open schooling course in environmental science, aimed at European teachers with teenage pupils. Of the 1,181 teachers who enrolled, 73% were females and 43% were from less privileged nations (according to UN Human Development Index). This is a higher share of less privileged (females) than is the case for the general population of Europe. Teachers from less privileged nations also participated in more project activities than did those from more privileged nations, apart from in urban areas. For the project period, the teachers reported a significant increase in all the three categories of aspired learning outcomes for their pupils. We conclude that courses like ours can increase teenagers’ literacy and engagement in science and environmental issues, not the least in less privileged areas. Deliberate efforts are required to reach these target groups, who may be less inclined to join on their own."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

field surveys were organized in the Fuglebekken coastal catchment of Hornsund, Spitsbergen, Svalbard, to map frozen and unfrozen ground and assess the spatial and temporal state of the permafrost. Surveys were conducted during maximum thawing in September and maximum freezing in April of the following year. The obtained seismic wavefields were interpreted using three methods: the dispersion of surface waves, seismic refraction, and travel time tomography. The seismic experiments were supported by nearby boreholes with continuous thermal monitoring. In the frozen survey, a gradual increase in ice content of water-filled sediments was found, farther from the coast. In September the shallow sensors in the boreholes validated positive ground temperatures down to 3.0 m depth, with below-zero temperatures at greater depths. However, seismic tomography indicated that the ground was unfrozen down to 30 m. The ground probably remained unfrozen due to intrusion of high-salinity seawater, even though it had been below 0°C. In April, in the area 300 m and farther from the coast, the ground below 3 m depth was frozen, except for a 19-m-deep open talik identified in a borehole at the slope of Fugle Mountain. We attribute the complex spatial extent, form, and condition of permafrost in the Fuglebekken coastal catchment to multiple factors, including variable solar energy, snow and ground cover, thermal and humidity properties of the soil, subsurface water flow, and seawater intrusion. The presented combination of seismic methods provides a new robust and precise approach to assess the spatial variability of permafrost in a coastal environment. The proposed interpretation shows deep percolation of subsurface flow into permafrost and its seasonal unfreezing at a depth of 30 m in both the zone of saltwater intrusion and the slope area."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60a763e69543c758682b6462","5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","62c796a8752340480571c990","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e7878c28a04739f06b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"264-276","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","5e7092e7878c28a04739f06b","62c796a8752340480571c990","60a763e69543c758682b6462","627a09454097077f84ebf923","5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454791f2","mniswId":"15880","title":"Permafrost and Periglacial Processes","issn":"1045-6740","eissn":"1099-1530","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"1efddefa-0220-4761-9cf3-91b289d85c78"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058111534"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"627b7b574097071271764d95","name":"Farzaneh","lastName":"Akbari","documentHash":"a062f5bc-03e9-40c1-ba91-7a93b5d55dfb"},{"objectId":"627b7b574097071271764d94","name":"Hossein","lastName":"Hamidifar","orcidId":"0000-0001-9054-0120","documentHash":"290f9c07-1365-4ec2-a80c-c2e25cd06d5b"},{"objectId":"5e7093f7878c28a0473b414b","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Rowiński","uuid":"5C587EC2CBF79687D6F938643FA39B1E4A2C914ED909935685E8C108F09235025E0F24890BE3A2F7DF076746F57B4CE7CEAD003A60C8BDF9A708807C38E2CA3C","orcidId":"0000-0001-7774-8592","documentHash":"d2015c6b-752e-415b-a0f2-367b630ebbb5"}],"objectId":"627b7b574097071271764d92","doi":"10.3390/w14060893","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/6/893/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Assessment of Environmental Water Requirement Allocation in Anthropogenic Rivers with a Hydropower Dam Using Hydrologically Based Methods—Case Study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Anthropogenic activities such as damming have caused an alteration in the natural flow regime in many rivers around the world. In this study, the role of constructing a hydroelectric dam on the natural flow regime of the Kor River, Iran, is investigated. Nine different methods, which fall into the category of hydrological methods, were used to determine the environmental water requirement (EWR) of the Kor River. In addition, two indices are introduced to evaluate the environmental flow allocation in anthropogenic rivers. The results show that although the supply of environmental flow in some months is in relatively acceptable conditions on average, there is a deficiency in the allocation of EWR in the range of 1.92–30.2% in the spawning period of the dominant fish species. The proposed indicators can provide a general picture of the status of environmental flow allocation in rivers where little ecological data is available and the hydrological regime has changed due to human activities, particularly in rivers with hydropower plants. Moreover, after the construction of the dam, no major floods have occurred in the river, which has led to the loss of the morpho-ecological balance in the river and disruption of the natural state of habitats. Therefore, the negative impact of dam construction on the environmental conditions of the river should be considered in the active management of the dam outlets."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f7878c28a0473b414b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"893","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["627b7b574097071271764d94","627b7b574097071271764d95","5e7093f7878c28a0473b414b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a9a","mniswId":"20224","title":"Water","issn":"2073-4441","eissn":"2073-4441","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"786ef469-6890-4f82-8160-9f545c27c509"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"627b7b574097071271764d98","year":"2022","volume":"6","number":"14","documentHash":"65f3baa2-85c5-48d4-b720-cfbebb123588"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["environmental flow;

The main purpose of the work was to identify which of Fe-bearing phases bind HMs in street dust. Magnetic parameters of the Fe-bearing compo- nents, mainly magnetically strong iron oxides, are used to assess the level of HM pollution. Chemical sequential extraction combined with magnetic methods (magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, remanent magnetization) allowed determining the metal-bearing fractions and identifying the iron forms that are mostly associated with trafc-related HMs. The use of Mössbauer spectrometry (MS) supplemented by magnetic methods (thermomagnetic curves and psarameters of hysteresis loops) enabled precise identication and characterization of iron-containing minerals. The classication of HMs into ve chemical fractions differing in mobility and bioaccessibility revealed that iron is most abundant (over 95%) in the residual fraction followed by the reducible fraction. HMs were present in reducible fraction in the fol- lowing order: Pb > Zn > Mn > Cr > Ni > Fe > Cu, while they bound to the residual fraction in the following order: Fe > Ni > Cr > Mn > Pb > Cu > Zn. The signature of the anthropogenic origin of street dust is the presence of strongly nonstoichiometric and defected grains of magnetite and their porous surface. Magnetite also occurs as an admixture with maghemite, and with a signicant proportion of hematite. A distinctive feature of street dust is the presence of metallic iron and iron carbides.

This profile is nearly parallel to the western Polish coast, halfway between Poland and the Danish island of Bornholm. The data acquisition was conducted with 15 ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) and 2 land stations. We applied the trial-and-error iterative ray-tracing technique using all identified seismic phases to derive crustal models by minimizing misfit between calculated and observed P-wave travel-times for individual layers. Final velocity model was further verified by forward potential field modelling, testing various P-wave velocity (Vp) to density relationships. The Moho boundary was inferred at 33–38 km depth, deepening towards the EEC, with the local ~3 km rise in a 40-km-wide zone north of the Caledonian Deformation Front, corresponding to the elevated middle-crust velocities Vp > 6.5 km/s. The lower and middle crust are mostly continuous along the BalTec profile with only minor perturbations between the EEC and WEP. Nevertheless, the thickness of these crustal layers is poorly constrained by seismic data along the SW section of the profile. In contrast, the upper crust and sedimentary cover can be subdivided into three domains, corresponding, from the NE to SW, to the EEC, TTZ and WEP, respectively. The EEC is characterised by the flat top of the basement, uniformly inclined towards the SW. The TTZ shows rapid thinning of cratonic upper crust and thickening of sedimentary layer. The WEP reveals, despite limited seismic coverage, a 13-km thick sedimentary overburden. The lateral changes of seismic structure within the upper crust and sedimentary cover along the BalTec profile can be attributed to protracted phases of late Palaeozoic-Mesozoic extension punctuated by the Carboniferous and Late Cretaceous inversion phases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938d878c28a0473ac926","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","5e709439878c28a0473b875d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"828","pagesFromTo":"229271","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709439878c28a0473b875d","5e70938d878c28a0473ac926","6231c9842467f05185351ac5","6231c9842467f05185351ac6","6231c9842467f05185351ac7","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","6231c9842467f05185351ac9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798ea","mniswId":"19321","title":"TECTONOPHYSICS","issn":"0040-1951","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"9f63cb9a-9c0e-4130-95a8-fd356130be11"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6231c9842467f05185351acb","year":"2022","volume":"828","documentHash":"36c1696f-eda0-49ea-a2f2-d5f822673b14"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Seismic velocity modellingBaltic SeaEast European CratonMoho depthGravity and magnetic model"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128381"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"624c20e12467f040ca9b63e6","name":"Antek K.","lastName":"Tokarski","documentHash":"b414b611-aeab-4bdd-ab2a-1a4118c6b4c4"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5881","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Lasocki","uuid":"0DB67631213A71D5331DB6BE22B671A23171043580C1220207A94F5B95578635EB31F3304B07B2CDD12E6461942B981ED63288E20843B4FF0F88E30BBD104FF0","orcidId":"0000-0002-3443-6473","documentHash":"61dcdbf0-edb5-4421-8bf9-20b8afc0eb45"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b4621","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Rudziński","uuid":"961F1D1124C7A6EE5547DCF0BA71246B84C544674F664FFB9BCD28552206D586EA78801AAEE81E2CE810AE31B51A5D62634DE5956B6F789EEEEFB590163D028A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2748-4167","documentHash":"6c723c64-3a72-4e29-83d4-a0e99517c798"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af539","name":"Beata","lastName":"Orlecka-Sikora","uuid":"05C232E225B92508A67E3CB3A26629C7F5FE6D6F78D547920033B0BA5768AD1CC1912FC2223767E5354F2AA14EE0974881A8A37C7952BC36AE274CCC6F9A4A00","orcidId":"0000-0002-0182-1455","documentHash":"dd7b93a1-d01a-4e00-bcec-bab626486cc5"}],"objectId":"624c20e12467f040ca9b63e2","doi":"10.3390/en15010336","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/1/336/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A Hydrofracturing-Triggered Earthquake Occurred Three Years after the Stimulation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hydrofracturing, used for shale gas exploitation, may induce felt, even damaging earthquakes. On 15 June 2019, an Mw2.8 earthquake occurred, spatially correlated with the location of earlier exploratory hydrofracturing operations for shale gas in Wysin in Poland. However, this earthquake was atypical. Hydrofracturing-triggered seismicity mainly occurs during stimulation; occasionally, it continues a few months after completion of the stimulation. In Wysin, there were only two weaker events during two-month hydrofracturing and then 35 months of seismic silence until the mentioned earthquake occurred. The Wysin site is in Gdańsk Pomerania broader region, located on the very weakly seismically active Precambrian Platform. The historical documents, covering 1000 years, report no natural earthquakes in Gdańsk Pomerania. We conclude, therefore, that despite the never observed before that long lag time after stimulation, the Mw2.8 earthquake was triggered by hydrofracturing. It is possible that its unusually late occurrence in relation to the time of its triggering technological activity was caused by changes in stresses due to time-dependent deformation of reservoir shales. The Wysin earthquake determines a new time horizon for the effect of HF on the stress state, which can lead to triggering earthquakes. Time-dependent deformation and its induced stress changes should be considered in shall gas reservoir exploitation plans."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af539","5e70940d878c28a0473b5881","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4621"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"336","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940d878c28a0473b5881","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4621","624c20e12467f040ca9b63e6","5e7093b2878c28a0473af539"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"67894746-212e-466e-b7ad-c33c45443ffa"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c2dfca2467f057531dd187","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"1","documentHash":"35d7af3b-28f3-4dc0-94a1-73c4071fb0ad"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hydrofracturing; injection-induced seismicity; shale gas"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058142184"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"624ed2b02467f009a40ec936","name":"Preston S.","lastName":"Wilson","orcidId":"0000-0002-4420-7180","documentHash":"405f079d-8393-4d02-84f2-033d4bfe00ae"},{"objectId":"624ed2b02467f009a40ec935","name":"Grant B.","lastName":"Deane","orcidId":"0000-0002-4848-8637","documentHash":"e4316146-cc22-4681-ae74-235bfc01a38b"},{"objectId":"624ed2b02467f009a40ec933","name":"Megan S.","lastName":"Ballard","documentHash":"99df0ff4-dd38-4f17-9c27-adf4c5d39fbf"},{"objectId":"624ed2b02467f009a40ec932","name":"Matthew C.","lastName":"Zeh","documentHash":"1ef6872c-6dc9-4072-97ce-cef38c5c94a8"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399421","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Głowacki","uuid":"2B61E3B0977F44ADF5940784DA33545E985A4674A2BE5C1A00602A9709904D6473265D9598959D628CA1FF81ACCF6380FF9FA95FBF4F462A70D671446FDC50E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-5164-0206","documentHash":"fda11004-7277-4981-810d-055b8dabc3a0"}],"objectId":"624ed2b02467f009a40ec930","doi":"10.1121/10.0010046","publicUri":"https://asa.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1121/10.0010046","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Model-data comparison of sound propagation in a glacierized fjord with a simulated brash ice surface","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Glacier ice loss impacts sound propagation within Arctic fjords. Regular calving events contribute to a collection of floating ice fragments, known as brash ice, at the ocean surface that obstruct the natural and anthropogenic acoustic signals, yet are difficult to characterize. Transmission loss measurements using a maximum length sequence (m-sequence) signal were conducted in September 2017 near Hansbreen glacier in Hornsund Fjord, Svalbard with dense brash ice present at the water surface. An acoustic model of the brash ice surface was inferred through consideration of the experimental geometry, arrival amplitude, and travel time difference between the direct and surface reflected arrivals from the source to two receivers.

It is not clear how this mechanism could effectively operate in hot, low-density plasma, where the electrical resistivity is extremely low.\n\nAims. We show that non-stationarity, a common factor in plasma turbulence (e.g., in the interstellar medium caused by random supernova explosions), allows inducing a strong large-scale electromotive force (EMF) by the plasma flow and significantly enhances the dynamo effect.\n\nMethods. We adopted the simplest approximation in which plasma evolution is modelled with a set of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations with a random, Gaussian, and non-stationary forcing to explicitly demonstrate the role of non-stationarity in the large-scale dynamo process. The EMF was calculated analytically in the limit of large magnetic Prandtl numbers (low magnetic diffusion in comparison with plasma viscosity) and strong magnetic fields for the non-stationary turbulence and the standard diffusive mechanism.\n\nResults. We show that the EMF induced by the effects of non-stationarity can typically be expected to dominate the dynamo mechanism (over the diffusive phase shift generation) by several orders of magnitude. This is confirmed by the explicit calculation in two example cases for the interstellar medium in the Milky Way galaxy and hot accretion disks such as those of active galactic nuclei."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927e878c28a047396b20"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"660","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927e878c28a047396b20"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477233","mniswId":"1982","title":"ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS","issn":"1432-0746","eissn":"1432-0746","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"b6a2adab-15ad-4a48-be0b-3081a5904500"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6268ef5f409707015984cd0e","year":"2022","number":"660","documentHash":"7d49d82d-e115-4e70-9bea-dd519eca775a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) / turbulence / ISM: magnetic fields / dynamo / magnetic fields / galaxies: nuclei"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145953"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"627b7d524097071271765ffb","name":"Senlin","lastName":"Zhu","documentHash":"0bf097fd-c431-4343-ba54-f026653e3e34"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Napiórkowski","uuid":"6AE9EEECF23A9027016CE0A5043569229D6A23680190D0C326173C1E6985FE82CE8B15504F7C20E43EC7B867AD3C2CF79197D909B3D518AC611E0C30D884583C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0273-4193","documentHash":"03e7ee2b-1337-4436-8dc2-d4e7730e5939"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","name":"Adam","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"864E3E49A2309C1FB479470AD68682EA3FAB4349A58557B0478C54157BBB2B92E9A4D1252BEC5AB9362F29E198D2892DA7519ED222E344D6630D3217C0FDAF82","orcidId":"0000-0003-0923-7314","documentHash":"25196237-6284-406e-a277-91b7ddef9871"}],"objectId":"627b7d524097071271765ff9","doi":"10.1016/j.limno.2022.125967","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0075951122000214?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Air2water model with nine parameters for lake surface temperature assessment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The air2water model is a physically-based model in which major physical processes are parameterized. It allows to predict the surface lake temperature based solely on the time series of the air temperature. Due to its simplicity and very limited data requirements, it has found numerous applications around the globe. The air2water model defines the normalized depth of the well-mixed surface layer using a fixed parameter. This parameter is a threshold value that is set to 4 °C – the temperature of water with maximum density – for dimictic lakes, and to the minimum or to the maximum water temperature for warm or cold monomictic lakes, respectively. In this paper we propose to calibrate the threshold value as the ninth parameter of the model, instead of setting it fixed. We test the proposed approach on a set of 30-years long daily data from 22 lakes located in the lowland part of Poland and 25-years long daily data from the two Great Lakes – Huron and Eire. The proposed modification is very simple and improves the performance of the model, especially for winter-spring season, for the vast majority of lakes not only for the calibration, but also for the independent 8–10 years long validation data."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","5e70942c878c28a0473b7920"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"94","pagesFromTo":"125967","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","627b7d524097071271765ffb","5e70944d878c28a0473ba087"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478cf4","mniswId":"13648","title":"Limnologica","issn":"0075-9511","eissn":"1873-5851","websiteLink":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00759511/50","documentHash":"545a94bc-f70c-46fb-8425-9979d02aee8d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"627b7d524097071271765ffe","year":"2022","number":"94","documentHash":"3678a99b-d6aa-4098-9aee-7e3f2050aac9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Water temperature Lake air2water Calibration algorithm Surface layer"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058156304"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62863a4c409707249f89fc63","name":"Najafi","lastName":"M.

Using three observational quantities, namely the weight function, the quality factor, and the velocity model in this region, we develop a modified dissipative sandpile model which captures the main features of the system, especially the average activity field over the region of study. The model is based on external stimuli, the location of which is chosen (I) randomly, (II) on the faults, (III) on the low active points, (IV) on the moderately active points, and (V) on the highly active points in the region. We uncover some universal behaviors depending slightly on the method of external stimuli. A multi-fractal detrended fluctuation analysis is exploited to extract the spectrum of the Hurst exponent of the time series obtained by each of these schemes. Although the average Hurst exponent depends slightly on the method of stimuli, we numerically show that in all cases it is lower than 0.5, reflecting the anti-correlated nature of the system. The lowest average Hurst exponent is found to be associated with the case (V), in such a way that the more active the stimulated sites are, the lower the average Hurst exponent is obtained, i.e. the large earthquakes are more anticorrelated. Moreover, we find that the activity field achieved in this study provide information about the depth and topography of the basement, and also the area that can potentially be the location of the future large events. We successfully determine a high activity zone on the Mosha Fault, where the mainshock occurred on May 7th, 2020 (MW 4.9)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7f36"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"8364","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62863a4c409707249f89fc61","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7f36","62863a4c409707249f89fc63"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific reports","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","documentHash":"a8d5fafa-84d9-440c-90fd-642e16e30467"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"624ab82f2467f01ec7fca23d","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"66d877fc-5541-4eef-8322-0b771152ef57"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Geophysics Nonlinear phenomena Phase transitions and critical phenomena"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058162447"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Osuch","uuid":"A15CE4704BFC55F4D73C5551A1BF8F722C8079811C8D2926C74DE5E2098F109CCBA98FF443EA760E7212470B8FEC3F616067AD3C9D8E6C8BEC9D2B1C3908DE94","orcidId":"0000-0002-1887-3569","documentHash":"447f1351-672a-4b79-b06d-7741f68786bb"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8d29","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Łepkowska","uuid":"1ECDE5E4CBCCF0D16350421D764C55422B17D42779406AA2A34D9B5598A1DBCA4A8ADF4EDEBB2AA665057F85961E90908EFC7C8A8B09006FA963FBA28AFB3658","orcidId":"0000-0001-7810-3112","documentHash":"989dda01-072f-4f48-8052-5a2fc826f2ef"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"C0584C144462F702B3240BEAC5B59EE267B2C41FD0108E80ADE2625711EBE1965DBD3F8183578828BBA3059F994E33D86CACFD8B0B3788616E7BE27271E913B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3393-753X","documentHash":"e1b00415-43de-446c-8e75-68765156a8a8"}],"objectId":"62065f092467f04995f3a8a9","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.152924","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969722000134?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Changes in the flow regime of High Arctic catchments with different stages of glaciation, SW Spitsbergen","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study investigates the response of four High Arctic catchments with differing proportions of glacierization to changing climatic conditions. The study area located in SW Spitsbergen, has experienced a warming of 4.5 °C in the last 40 years along with a large increase in autumn rainfall. The changes in flow regime were determined based on available hydro-meteorological data and simulations of a semi-distributed rainfall-runoff model, which allowed reconstruction of streamflow in the period 1979–2020 and trend analyses for each calendar day. Similar trends of change were detected in all studied catchments. These include earlier onset of snowmelt driven floods (by two weeks over the period of analysis), large increases in autumn flows, prolongation of the hydrologically active season (starts earlier and lasts longer), decrease in flows in the latter half of June and the early part of August (except for the Breelva catchment). As a result of increases in autumn precipitation, the flood regime in these catchments has changed from snowmelt-dominated to the bi-modal with peaks in both July/August and September. The results also indicate differences in the magnitude of hydrological response depending on the percentage of glacial coverage in the catchments. The larger the glacierized area is, the larger the changes in the flow regime.\n\nThe hydrological regime of SW Spitsbergen catchments has undergone dramatic changes over the last four decades.

The aftershock dataset was recorded for 1 month after the main shock by 23 temporary seismic stations operated by the International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology (IIEES). After applying the selection criteria, 331 well-located events, including more than 1700 waveforms, remained. By calculating the surface wave dispersion measurements in the period range of 0.6–5 s, a tomographic procedure was then performed, and the local dispersion curves were extracted for each geographic grid point (1.8 km × 1.8 km). We applied an iterative damped least-squares inversion procedure to obtain the VSV and VSH models at depths of up to 6.5 km. The discrepancy between these VSV and VSH models also resulted in the radial anisotropy model. Moreover, the P-wave first-arrival times were inverted by the computer program SIMULPS to calculate the VP model for a depth range of 6.5–14 km, while the calculated VP model does not have sufficient resolution at depths of up to 6 km. The tomographic results indicate that a ~ 2 km thick upper sedimentary layer with a shear wave velocity of less than 2.4 km/s and relatively negative radial anisotropy covers the study area (except Bam City, with a thin 500 m positive radial anisotropy layer), which overlay on relatively positive radial anisotropy. Our results indicate that the main shock occurred on the Bam fault escarpment; then the rupturing was shifted to the co-seismic surface rupture (approximately 5 km west of the escarpment) at a depth of ~8–10 km. This dividing of energy on the fault plane (an oblique Y shape) leads to damping most of the energy as a deformation in the lower sedimentary layer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7f36"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"324","pagesFromTo":"106852","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7f36","620f64cf2467f0419c58f7ca"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479281","mniswId":"16121","title":"PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS","issn":"0031-9201","eissn":"1872-7395","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"ecfcba89-d89a-439c-b20e-86616752ac89"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"620f64cf2467f0419c58f7cc","year":"2022","volume":"324","documentHash":"2762a148-cca1-4333-b104-a93313d5aaa5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Surface wave tomographyFirst-arrival P-wave tomographyRadial anisotropyBam earthquake"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185509"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5ffd4089085dcb6be6b609f5","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Jeż","uuid":"AA2F7BA22CF92399D848E4EEEC8CA39B1172AEF45461879307482EB3DB9A3ACB8BDEC81DEB0F78755BD9AF61054F09720349C81CBD5CCF9AE21A294D31CDCD71","documentHash":"54c1782c-8a5e-43ef-8d42-9d503c76d655"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a94","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Jóźwiak","uuid":"4E5E132578D4BB8C6699ABA9D9AA755BEDE5EDCF78BB9D2222333F2D3EA1F03E2F5712F4FF017D3F481FE74BE181898526F74DC8C3F49B082930F3B967FDB9D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1363-2934","documentHash":"4d028842-73fe-4207-85dc-690885a13fbc"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a91","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nowożyński","uuid":"B4EB89CB942D5A430A9FEB8EE16693BCEF80CFCB9CD8B73CD6F1F307D6D6A6CCAEB3EEC25BB267FA6C54CDDF9D4F20BE25AD181220DD49C3A71174C186744971","orcidId":"0000-0002-5225-8041","documentHash":"09ac3b93-9a89-459b-8f84-096e5bb066cc"},{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b03b7","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"DC410D50D4BE868F9B25BB7088AA70941BC33FF986D915C2831FDC9381CFB161C2B1760999524F436813FB770E2A77B58E8E9188DF85AD11365711B45A9C685B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6560-1048","documentHash":"c5b9d747-cc0c-4744-be1f-69f1e778b020"}],"objectId":"6319c13c4097073416d59ed8","doi":"10.1007/s10712-022-09716-1","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10712-022-09716-1","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Deep Electrical Resistivity Structure of the European Lithosphere in Poland Derived from 3-D Inversion of Magnetotelluric Data","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a three-dimensional (3-D) model of the resistivity distribution in the European lithosphere at the junction between the East European Craton, the Palaeozoic Platform of Western Europe and the Carpathians. The model was created by inverting the magnetotelluric and geomagnetic deep sounding data from 593 points collected over the last 50 years. ModEM code was used to invert the data and obtain the conductivity distribution model. The full size of the mesh with edges was 3000 by 3000 kms and 600 kms in the vertical direction, and the modelling field was digitized with 104 × 104 × 52 (+ 10 air) cells in geographic orientations. A trial-and-error approach was applied to select the best model parameters, such as the starting model and the covariance matrix. The results show a variable thickness of the sedimentary layer, increasing westward, and the presence of deep and extensive conductive anomalies in the crystalline crust. Early Permian continental rifting responsible for the SW-ward lithospheric thinning, localised crustal stretching and subsidence of a broad sedimentary basin had a primary impact on the distribution of resistivity anomalies. While the pre-rift tectonic features have little impact on the resistivity structure, the effects of Late Cretaceous-Paleogene accretion of the Western Carpathians and inversion of the Permian-Mesozoic Polish Basin are clearly detectable in the resistivity pattern. Consequently, our study highlights the role of relatively young tectonic processes in the evolution of a transition zone linking old and stable Eastern Europe with younger and mobile Western Europe."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a94","5e709410878c28a0473b5a91"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"x","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a94","5e709410878c28a0473b5a91","5e7093c1878c28a0473b03b7","5ffd4089085dcb6be6b609f5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989c","mniswId":"19171","title":"Surveys in Geophysics","issn":"0169-3298","eissn":"1573-0956","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"128173ec-4562-4bc5-a299-b6af45a4c43a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a19c424097073ee832120c","year":"2022","volume":"","number":"43","doi":"","documentHash":"3585ace2-636d-458d-b0f4-eed4d8221984"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Magnetotellurics 3-D inversion East European Craton Palaeozoic Platform Continental rifting Western Carpathians Polish Basin"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058206863"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"627a0b684097077f84ec14d8","name":"Sanna","lastName":"Rötsä","documentHash":"34d56f04-4532-4532-bd82-c4b5f12c097e"},{"objectId":"627a0b684097077f84ec14d7","name":"Suvi","lastName":"Heinonen","orcidId":"0000-0001-9531-3381","documentHash":"7ba3c86e-8d1e-41f1-99a4-250ee94b7c97"},{"objectId":"627a0b684097077f84ec14d6","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Koivisto","documentHash":"ae54fa97-7983-4fc5-94f4-8bbaf8107f5c"},{"objectId":"627a0b684097077f84ec14d5","name":"Deyan","lastName":"Draganov","orcidId":"0000-0001-8606-1178","documentHash":"23ece352-ac00-414a-91e3-a759a4cceed7"},{"objectId":"627a0b684097077f84ec14d3","name":"Michal","lastName":"Chamarczuk","documentHash":"82341153-0fcc-4d2a-9077-996eb7ca2a63"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","name":"Michał","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":"E022BA94789D74D23E41FED253EBD1E58BB96F3392CDEC6D0E204CD5AD5BB297E9ACB8770CC1CF4EBC30E32E3D816EE170453CA93CA7EA60A329F728C6E29B7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7190-3683","documentHash":"350c51a6-178b-45f0-ba79-d8fde881460e"}],"objectId":"627a0b684097077f84ec14d1","doi":"10.5194/se-13-705-2022","publicUri":"https://se.copernicus.org/articles/13/705/2022/se-13-705-2022.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Reflection imaging of complex geology in a crystalline environment using virtual-source seismology: case study from the Kylylahti polymetallic mine, Finland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"For the first time, we apply a full-scale 3D seismic virtual-source survey (VSS) for the purpose of near-mine mineral exploration. The data were acquired directly above the Kylylahti underground mine in Finland. Recorded ambient noise (AN) data are characterized using power spectral density (PSD) and beamforming. Data have the most energy at frequencies 25–90 Hz, and arrivals with velocities higher than 4 km s−1 have a wide range of azimuths. Based on the PSD and beamforming results, we created 10 d subset of AN recordings that were dominated by multi-azimuth high-velocity arrivals. We use an illumination diagnosis technique and location procedure to show that the AN recordings associated with high apparent velocities are related to body-wave events. Next, we produce 994 virtual-source gathers by applying seismic interferometry processing by cross-correlating AN at all receivers, resulting in full 3D VSS. We apply standard 3D time-domain reflection seismic data processing and imaging using both a selectively stacked subset and full passive data, and we validate the results against a pre-existing detailed geological information and 3D active-source survey data processed in the same way as the passive data. The resulting post-stack migrated sections show agreement of reflections between the passive and active data and indicate that VSS provides images where the active-source data are not available due to terrain restrictions. We conclude that while the all-noise approach provides some higher-quality reflections related to the inner geological contacts within the target formation and the general dipping trend of the formation, the selected subset is most efficient in resolving the base of formation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

identified climatically and environmentally significant high-latitude dust sources","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Dust particles from high latitudes have a potentially large local, regional, and global significance to climate and the environment as short-lived climate forcers, air pollutants, and nutrient sources. Identifying the locations of local dust sources and their emission, transport, and deposition processes is important for understanding the multiple impacts of high-latitude dust (HLD) on the Earth's systems. Here, we identify, describe, and quantify the source intensity (SI) values, which show the potential of soil surfaces for dust emission scaled to values 0 to 1 concerning globally best productive sources, using the Global Sand and Dust Storms Source Base Map (G-SDS-SBM). This includes 64 HLD sources in our collection for the northern (Alaska, Canada, Denmark, Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, Sweden, and Russia) and southern (Antarctica and Patagonia) high latitudes. Activity from most of these HLD sources shows seasonal character. It is estimated that high-latitude land areas with higher (SI ≥0.5), very high (SI ≥0.7), and the highest potential (SI ≥0.9) for dust emission cover >1 670 000 km2, >560 000 km2, and >240 000 km2, respectively. In the Arctic HLD region (≥60∘ N), land area with SI ≥0.5 is 5.5 % (1 035 059 km2), area with SI ≥0.7 is 2.3 % (440 804 km2), and area with SI ≥0.9 is 1.1 % (208 701 km2). Minimum SI values in the northern HLD region are about 3 orders of magnitude smaller, indicating that the dust sources of this region greatly depend on weather conditions. Our spatial dust source distribution analysis modeling results showed evidence supporting a northern HLD belt, defined as the area north of 50∘ N, with a “transitional HLD-source area” extending at latitudes 50–58∘ N in Eurasia and 50–55∘ N in Canada and a “cold HLD-source area” including areas north of 60∘ N in Eurasia and north of 58∘ N in Canada, with currently “no dust source” area between the HLD and low-latitude dust (LLD) dust belt, except for British Columbia. Using the global atmospheric transport model SILAM, we estimated that 1.0 % of the global dust emission originated from the high-latitude regions. About 57 % of the dust deposition in snow- and ice-covered Arctic regions was from HLD sources. In the southern HLD region, soil surface conditions are favorable for dust emission during the whole year. Climate change can cause a decrease in the duration of snow cover, retreat of glaciers, and an increase in drought, heatwave intensity, and frequency, leading to the increasing frequency of topsoil conditions favorable for dust emission, which increases the probability of dust storms. Our study provides a step forward to improve the representation of HLD in models and to monitor, quantify, and assess the environmental and climate significance of HLD."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

atmospheric radioactivity monitoring network. A decade of monitoring results have shown the 137Cs background levels in Arctic air range from 0.05 to 1.50 μBq/m3. The monitoring stations have sufficient sensitivity to detect 137Cs brought to the atmosphere due to resuspension in local soil and reemissions from biomass burning in a daily temporal resolution. These observations can be used as tracers for atmospheric processes. The 133Xe measurements obtained at Yellowknife, Resolute and Spitsbergen could support other research into how air pollution problems arise across intercontinental distances. It will help develop and improve models capable of predicting the long-distance transport and deposition of trace gases in the Arctic. Rainwater monitoring data collected in Finnish Lapland since the 1960's indicate that 3H radioactivity concentrations reached natural background levels in early 2000s, typically around 1–2 Bq/L monthly, with an annual seasonal variation cycle consistent with the observed of other cosmogenic radionuclides."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a92"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"253-254","pagesFromTo":"107013","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["632d9de64097073ab885045b","632d9de64097073ab885045c","632d9de64097073ab885045d","632d9de64097073ab885045e","632d9de64097073ab885045f","632d9de64097073ab8850460","632d9de64097073ab8850461","632d9de64097073ab8850462","632d9de64097073ab8850463","632d9de64097073ab8850464","5e709410878c28a0473b5a92","632d9de64097073ab8850465"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478693","mniswId":"11002","title":"JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY","issn":"0265-931X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a4be13a-b4eb-45bc-9145-3b9b23bc084a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632d9de64097073ab885045a","year":"2022","volume":"253-254","documentHash":"b6609eff-2860-498b-8ef3-14ba4f73a1d9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058240127"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6284f3c740970712d1b74dc1","name":"Simon L.","lastName":"Harley","documentHash":"f75e3499-7601-4ac0-9353-f0de1c28da0e"},{"objectId":"6284f3c740970712d1b74dc0","name":"Shinae","lastName":"Lee","documentHash":"a95614d6-0805-4338-a8d3-11e1166c8c3e"},{"objectId":"6284f3c740970712d1b74dbf","name":"Martin J.","lastName":"Whitehouse","documentHash":"86a659ef-f074-4628-ad98-fd3ce6220b45"},{"objectId":"6284f3c740970712d1b74dbe","name":"Keewook","lastName":"Yi","documentHash":"a265efa4-c6bb-4529-a9c2-d689180a2e4b"},{"objectId":"6284f3c740970712d1b74dbd","name":"Simon A.","lastName":"Wilde","documentHash":"82a91ff2-bc34-402e-ad6e-7a819e0ba8ea"},{"objectId":"6284f3c740970712d1b74dba","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Król","documentHash":"76de5f9f-4785-4062-a072-9ac079678a64"},{"objectId":"5f5b4028752340073806a9b5","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Dunkley","uuid":"940993469313C143C462EBEBE867F79D6863EFBDE1331E198532EF8D68AC43FB8904B76E77D6AA9CE7E4FEEA534C939BACA51E20A70301995B30B64FB435B839","documentHash":"79aab392-a25b-460c-9588-595aadb97e78"},{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kusiak","uuid":"3052A19F570F1180C90FE5ED9510A53FCEA3A401B154BB701C443A248D410748C9CFEB65CF60BA418E2ECBD9AAFA204B99C32FF77545357BEC09625DF52F2ECD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2042-8621","documentHash":"10e63152-d296-4f9a-9487-cad0a39065f2"}],"objectId":"6284f3c740970712d1b74db9","doi":"10.1016/j.precamres.2021.106530","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0301926821004587?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Neoarchean magmatism in the southern Scott and Raggatt Mountains, Napier Complex, east Antarctica","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Napier Complex of Enderby Land and Kemp Land is a unique part of the Eastern Antarctic Shield, as it preserves history of crustal growth extending from the Eo- to Neoarchean. It is composed mainly of enderbitic and charnockitic gneisses and granulites metamorphosed at ca. 2.5 Ga, and locally at ca. 2.8 Ga, under high- to ultra-high temperature conditions. These events have been well-characterized in the central and western parts of the complex; however, the south-southwestern region has been little studied. Samples from the southern Scott and Raggatt Mountains were selected for zircon U-Pb dating by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry and whole-rock geochemical analysis. Tonalitic gneiss from the Raggatt Mountains and trondhjemitic gneiss from the southern Scott Mountains have protolith ages of 2711 ± 5 Ma and 2726 ± 6 Ma, respectively. In contrast, tonalitic samples from the southern Scott Mountains have protolith ages of ca. 2539 ± 5, 2533 ± 5 and 2522 ± 9 Ma. The younger generation of magmatism overlaps the timing of metamorphic zircon growth between 2540 and 2440 Ma observed in this study. The geochemistry of ca. 2720 Ma gneisses indicates that magmatism was generated by medium-pressure melting (>1.5 GPa) of basaltic crust, whereas ca. 2530 Ma magmas were generated at lower pressures (<1.2 GPa). The ca. 2.7 Ga magmatism may be associated with continental crust formed at 2.8 Ga, or be newly formed crust that was assembled with older prior to or during a tectonometamorphic event at ca. 2.5 Ga. Tonalitic magmatism at 2.53 Ga during the first half of the 2585–2420 Ma metamorphic event may be a product of partial melting during high-grade metamorphism. Although protolith ages across the complex are still scarce, differences between regions raise the possibility that the complex contains crustal domains of different ages and origins that may not have been assembled until the ca. 2.5 Ga tectonothermal event."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f5b4028752340073806a9b5","5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"370","pagesFromTo":"106530","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6284f3c740970712d1b74dba","5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6","5f5b4028752340073806a9b5","6284f3c740970712d1b74dbd","6284f3c740970712d1b74dbe","6284f3c740970712d1b74dbf","6284f3c740970712d1b74dc0","6284f3c740970712d1b74dc1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479360","mniswId":"16452","title":"Precambrian Research","issn":"0301-9268","eissn":"1872-7433","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"6adf7a04-7dd1-4774-ae03-32ee3f0b99ac"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61eaaf222467f06f09e21cdc","year":"2022","volume":"370","documentHash":"127bd2af-529c-4db7-b5e9-30865a920a22"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["East Antarctica Enderby Land Napier Complex Archean granitoids Zircon U-Pb geochronology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058247002"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6284e5bd40970712d1b6e645","name":"Martyn R.","lastName":"Drury","documentHash":"62079ac4-3758-4f0f-952d-83984ef24020"},{"objectId":"6284e5bd40970712d1b6e642","name":"Christian","lastName":"Rønnevik","documentHash":"ecf7a251-b44c-4da3-a062-eb97794e0b52"},{"objectId":"6284e5bd40970712d1b6e641","name":"Jan","lastName":"Michalek","documentHash":"060ba331-768a-4dd9-88eb-5398849e0afd"},{"objectId":"6284e5bd40970712d1b6e640","name":"Ronald","lastName":"Pijnenburg","documentHash":"f50815f3-61e7-4c41-816c-1662f187e6f5"},{"objectId":"6284e5bd40970712d1b6e63e","name":"Massimo","lastName":"Cocco","documentHash":"0bf11e12-481d-4558-b3ed-fd056b757e2d"},{"objectId":"6284e5bd40970712d1b6e63d","name":"Kuvvet","lastName":"Atakan","documentHash":"30e3246e-e6e4-46c2-9b40-18855746bd73"},{"objectId":"5e709451878c28a0473ba608","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Olszewska","uuid":"EFCC4051F5314122FAA3EB7F39FC9BFD279AFC09627530E56DD9A6F51C61FD876C5BB9B2710C3A0443A1034F9A985F10DE74A616299F9F3B1CCF7C5263E418D8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3714-3518","documentHash":"5cf9ffc1-9b31-4fda-9f30-92079e85349a"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b","name":"Beata","lastName":"Górka-Kostrubiec","uuid":"837CE8D75E0ECD3E327460670495F33AD004F18316960AEE744DCB63710EB639069A5F2B1240E8B20E21AC170FC616C7D7E9D246798C609ADE31FA8E049F61DF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6337-7583","documentHash":"2b3d8aa3-c2a8-4bd0-a8fa-dd1830c1e138"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af539","name":"Beata","lastName":"Orlecka-Sikora","uuid":"05C232E225B92508A67E3CB3A26629C7F5FE6D6F78D547920033B0BA5768AD1CC1912FC2223767E5354F2AA14EE0974881A8A37C7952BC36AE274CCC6F9A4A00","orcidId":"0000-0002-0182-1455","documentHash":"dd7b93a1-d01a-4e00-bcec-bab626486cc5"}],"objectId":"6284e5bd40970712d1b6e63c","doi":"10.4401/ag-8758","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4401/ag-8758","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"National EPOS initiatives and participation to the EPOS integration plan","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"European Plate Observing System (EPOS) is designed on a three-level architecture.

In this architecture, data provision from the NRIs is an essential element for the sustainable operation of the EPOS research infrastructure (RI). National EPOS initiatives in various countries in Europe are developed thanks to the increased awareness of the importance of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) data management in science. As such, out of the 14 countries (13 members and one observer) that constitute the EPOS European Research Infrastructure Consortium (EPOS-ERIC), 11 have dedicated EPOS consortia established and included in the national roadmaps for research infrastructures. Moreover, there are in total 24 countries involved in the EPOS delivery framework where 10 are not yet members of EPOS-ERIC. However, the diversity of regulations and procedures adopted in different countries, hampers the development of dedicated EPOS consortia contributing to sustainability.

Aerosol measurements in Raciborz (50.08° N, 18.19° E), Poland, made using the CIMEL Sun photometer and collocated CHM-15k “Nimbus” ceilometer are analyzed for the period 2015–2020. Vertical profiles of the aerosol extinction are derived from the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm combining the ceilometer measurements of the aerosol backscattering coefficient with the collocated CIMEL measurements of the columnar characteristics of aerosols. The photolysis frequencies are calculated at the three levels in the lower troposphere (the surface and 0.5 and 2 km above the surface) using a radiative transfer model, Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible (TUV), for various settings of aerosol optical properties in the model input. The importance of the aerosol vertical distribution on photolysis frequencies is inferred by analyzing statistics of the differences between the output of the model, including the extinction profile from the GRASP algorithm, and the default TUV model (based on columnar aerosol characteristics by the CIMEL Sun photometer and Elterman’s extinction profile). For model levels above the surface, standard deviation, 2.5th percentile, 97.5th percentile, and the extremes, calculated from relative differences between these input settings, are comparable with the pertaining statistical values for the input pair providing changes of photolysis frequencies only due to the variability of the columnar aerosol characteristics. This indicates that the vertical properties of aerosols affect the distribution of the photolysis frequencies in the lower troposphere on a similar scale to that due to variations in columnar aerosol characteristics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709359878c28a0473a7c28","5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","62861bc3409707249f88561d","5e70936c878c28a0473a93e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1057","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709359878c28a0473a7c28","62861bc3409707249f88561d","5e70936c878c28a0473a93e2","5e709410878c28a0473b5a96"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","doi":"10.3390/rs","issn":"2072-4292","eissn":"2072-4292","documentHash":"4455816a-4488-4bca-b561-a29136e7efc7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6225af6c2467f0548a005b33","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"5","documentHash":"e7a0077a-2ace-47a0-acf2-993cc947b0a4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["atmospheric aerosols; photolysis; lower troposphere; radiative transfer modeling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058250239"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6286050d409707249f874283","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Budzik","documentHash":"7685ec50-ac24-42c3-afbf-1ce37c6c331c"},{"objectId":"6286050d409707249f874282","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Plenzler","documentHash":"e321e20e-0270-4a4c-8df0-4c4103315cc1"},{"objectId":"6286050d409707249f87427f","name":"Marek","lastName":"Kejna","documentHash":"c539ab7a-0433-4100-a925-a17cc0a07eb7"},{"objectId":"6286050d409707249f87427e","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Araźny","documentHash":"8293d2dc-46c2-47d4-8759-72f5c4691b86"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Osuch","uuid":"A15CE4704BFC55F4D73C5551A1BF8F722C8079811C8D2926C74DE5E2098F109CCBA98FF443EA760E7212470B8FEC3F616067AD3C9D8E6C8BEC9D2B1C3908DE94","orcidId":"0000-0002-1887-3569","documentHash":"447f1351-672a-4b79-b06d-7741f68786bb"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"C0584C144462F702B3240BEAC5B59EE267B2C41FD0108E80ADE2625711EBE1965DBD3F8183578828BBA3059F994E33D86CACFD8B0B3788616E7BE27271E913B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3393-753X","documentHash":"e1b00415-43de-446c-8e75-68765156a8a8"}],"objectId":"6286050d409707249f87427d","doi":"10.36921/kos.2022_2836","publicUri":"https://kosmos.ptpk.org/index.php/Kosmos/article/download/2836/2735","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Zmiany klimatu w ekosystemach Arktyki i Antarktyki","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"70","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"578-595","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6286050d409707249f87427e","6286050d409707249f87427f","5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","6286050d409707249f874282","6286050d409707249f874283"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac20ad204581b62ebb9b","mniswId":"201381","title":"Kosmos.

In this paper, a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is applied to the nonlinear inversion of fundamental-mode Rayleigh wave group dispersion curves for shear and compressional wave velocities. In our approach, we invert thickness, velocities and densities and their vertical gradients of four layers, sediments, upper-crust, lower-crust and lithospheric mantle.\n\nAt first, to determine the efficiency and stability of the method, noise-free and noisy synthetic data sets are inverted. Results from the synthetic data demonstrate that the SA applied to the nonlinear inversion of surface wave data is interesting not only in terms of accuracy but also in terms of the convergence speed. In fact, the SA method is suitable for large-scale optimization problems, especially for those in which a desired global minimum is hidden among many local minima. In a second step, real data in SE Iran are inverted to examine the usage and robustness of the proposed approach on real surface wave data. Then, we applied 3D gravity modeling based on surface wave analysis results to obtain the density structure of each layer. The reason for using both types of data sets is that the gravity anomaly does not have a good vertical resolution and surface wave group velocities are more appropriate for placing layer limits at depth, but they are not very sensitive to density variations. Therefore, the use of gravity data increases the overall resolution of density distribution. Compared with the Shuffle Complex Evolution (SCE) method that was implemented in a previous study, we found out that the SA method is more stable and has less variability of model parameter values in successive tests. In the final step, we reapplied the SA method to invert the fundamental-mode Rayleigh wave group velocities based on the results of gravity modeling. Gravity results, such as thicknesses and densities were used to limit the search space in the SA method.\n\nOur results show that the Moho depth across the Makran subduction zone is increasing from the Oman seafloor (24–30 km) and Makran forearc setting (34–42 km) to the Taftan-Bazman volcanic arc (47–49 km). Also, the results show high shear and compressional velocities under the Gulf of Oman, decreasing to the north of the Makran region. The density image shows an average crustal density with maximum values under the Gulf of Oman, decreasing northward to the Makran region."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6100f59d9543c7220b70a8c3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","pagesFromTo":"100101","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6100f59d9543c7220b70a8c3","6295cb5e4097072fefb81ba1","6295cb5e4097072fefb81ba2","6295cb5e4097072fefb81ba3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f289","mniswId":"28223","title":"Journal of Asian Earth Sciences: X","issn":"2590-0560","documentHash":"4f50ae95-5cc2-454c-9458-4bb538ee673c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6295cb5e4097072fefb81ba5","year":"2022","volume":"7","documentHash":"057cbbee-1f5f-47da-8cbc-d06cf558d585"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Simulated Annealing algorithmRayleigh wave group velocity dataShear VelocityGravity inversionMoho DepthMakran"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261768"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633fe18c4097074a2ba77651","name":"Oral","lastName":"Yagci","documentHash":"f577a611-38ab-4c58-94c9-dc25dd428979"},{"objectId":"633fe18c4097074a2ba77650","name":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Michalis","documentHash":"16c4efe1-cc1d-4c53-9019-4c8d9a23d71f"},{"objectId":"633fe18c4097074a2ba7764f","name":"Gordon","lastName":"Gilja","documentHash":"62447613-99e0-463e-beac-5be663db7350"},{"objectId":"633fe18c4097074a2ba7764e","name":"Manousos","lastName":"Valyrakis","documentHash":"3aa41f93-43f4-4657-8cd8-bb7a376b9980"},{"objectId":"633fe18c4097074a2ba7764d","name":"Yi","lastName":"Xu","documentHash":"89aecff5-3c9b-43bd-ba49-4b04f034a286"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abd8e","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Przyborowski","uuid":"2754E03EAD5086898936AFDB02E83F74F31AA479A3A647F230576A77C356868291C406E4B4F1977EFC59E5DA0B0FD46185D3ED89EFF54B8037D1A0522F3DF534","orcidId":"0000-0003-0900-1387","documentHash":"64d0a52f-ee6e-4c33-8fa6-d63704db387b"}],"objectId":"633fe18c4097074a2ba7764b","doi":"10.3390/w14182880","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/w14182880","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Assessing Riverbed Surface Destabilization Risk Downstream Isolated Vegetation Elements","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A few decades ago, river erosion protective approaches were widely implemented, such as straightening the river course, enhancing riverbed/bank stability with layers of concrete or riprap, and increasing channel conveyance capacity (i.e., overwidening). However, recent research has established that such practices can be tremendously costly and adversely affect the rivers’ ecological health. To alleviate these effects, green river restoration has emerged as a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach that can reduce the negative impact of the riverbed and bank destabilization and flooding. One of the typical green restoration measures, especially for instream habitat improvement, is the establishment of instream vegetation, which leads to a more diversified flow regime, increasing habitat availability and serving as refugia for aquatic species. Within the perspective presented above, flow–vegetation interaction problems for several decades received significant attention. In these studies, rigid rods have commonly been used to simulate these vegetative roughness elements without directly assessing the riverbed destabilization potential. Here, an experimental study is carried out to investigate the effect of different instream vegetation porosity on the near-bed flow hydrodynamics and riverbed destabilization potential for a range of simulated vegetation species. Specifically, the flow field downstream, four distinct simulated vegetation elements is recorded using an acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV), assuming about the same solid volume fraction for the different vegetation elements. In addition, bed destabilization potential is assessed by recording with optical means (a He-Ne laser with a camera system) the entrainment rate of a 15 mm particle resting on the uniform bed surface and the number of impulses above a critical value. Results revealed that the number of impulses above a critical value at the normalized distance equal to two is a good indicator for cylinder and five for other vegetation to assess the riverbed destabilization potential. The experimental findings from this study have interesting geomorphological implications regarding the destabilization of the riverbed surface (removal of coarse particles induced by high magnitude turbulent impulses) and the successful establishment of seedlings downstream of instream vegetation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b0878c28a047384e31","name":"University of Glasgow","affiliatedPersonIDs":["633fe18c4097074a2ba7764d","633fe18c4097074a2ba7764e"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091c1878c28a047387e56","name":"University of Zagreb","affiliatedPersonIDs":["633fe18c4097074a2ba7764f"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b6878c28a047385e76","name":"National Technical University of Athens","affiliatedPersonIDs":["633fe18c4097074a2ba77650"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709199878c28a04738041a","name":"Istanbul Teknik Üniversitesi (Istanbul Technical University)","affiliatedPersonIDs":["633fe18c4097074a2ba77651"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709386878c28a0473abd8e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"2880","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["633fe18c4097074a2ba7764d","633fe18c4097074a2ba7764e","633fe18c4097074a2ba7764f","633fe18c4097074a2ba77650","633fe18c4097074a2ba77651","5e709386878c28a0473abd8e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a9a","mniswId":"20224","title":"Water (Switzerland)","issn":"2073-4441","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f45dfe6a-c51f-4cba-a665-a984d2f35671"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633fe18c4097074a2ba7764c","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"18","documentHash":"5db3fbaf-99e6-4604-a01f-467c6a8ad4d8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058268471"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399421","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Głowacki","uuid":"2B61E3B0977F44ADF5940784DA33545E985A4674A2BE5C1A00602A9709904D6473265D9598959D628CA1FF81ACCF6380FF9FA95FBF4F462A70D671446FDC50E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-5164-0206","documentHash":"fda11004-7277-4981-810d-055b8dabc3a0"}],"objectId":"635bd1e0409707035d110ec3","doi":"10.1017/jog.2022.32","publicUri":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0022143022000326","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Distinguishing subaerial and submarine calving with underwater noise","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Iceberg calving is one of the major mechanisms of ice loss from tidewater glaciers and ice sheets, but obtaining accurate estimates of ice discharge that are both continuous and accurate is a challenging task. Recent results have demonstrated the effective application of passive cryoacoustics – the use of naturally generated sounds to study the cryosphere – to quantify subaerial calving fluxes. However, little is known about the acoustic signatures of submarine calving. This study investigates the underwater noise from 656 subaerial and 162 submarine calving events observed at Hansbreen, Svalbard in the summers of 2016 and 2017. Statistical analysis of the acoustic signal shows that the normalized power of the calving noise is log-normally distributed regardless of the calving mode. However, submarine events can be distinguished from subaerial events by using the shape parameter of the log-normal distribution paired with the calving signal duration. The newly developed classification model may potentially be used for two purposes: (1) to study potential causal relationships between these two calving modes and (2) to separate calving fluxes into subaerial and submarine components. The latter will also require knowledge of the relationship between ice mass and sound spectral level for submarine calving events."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a047399421"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929e878c28a047399421"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478739","mniswId":"11245","title":"JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY","issn":"0022-1430","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a073b4a-6fa6-4bf0-a497-117524616f22"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"635bd1e0409707035d110ec4","year":"2022","documentHash":"51a7ee5f-3a47-467a-8d04-53ba666bed59"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Arctic glaciology calving glacier calving iceberg calving ice/ocean interactions"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058271800"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"635bd445409707035d112072","name":"Paul","lastName":"Marsden","documentHash":"d13fea37-d6f2-49d0-aceb-de7e5f770d11"},{"objectId":"635bd445409707035d112071","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Sito","documentHash":"cd0e3130-5545-41aa-b7f1-0d3bf7f6732f"},{"objectId":"635bd445409707035d112070","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Buske","documentHash":"d81b06ef-757a-4e8d-b43c-f93fa00714b3"},{"objectId":"635bd445409707035d11206f","name":"Alireza","lastName":"Malehmir","documentHash":"db5d2bbb-7175-4b87-9995-894499689968"},{"objectId":"5e7094e7878c28a0473c668b","name":"Brij","lastName":"Singh","uuid":"7C247FAC360488F5441A6E75E108F332B9CD2FE597AEEDC66A0E242FA709D26C2BD9AAC29BD58EC8E0F526338E28B0615C2575F9B0AD8E83992A945669FC9139","orcidId":"0000-0002-4995-2542","documentHash":"d81f192a-9e5e-41dc-a962-81fbc45d83a7"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","name":"Michał","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":"E022BA94789D74D23E41FED253EBD1E58BB96F3392CDEC6D0E204CD5AD5BB297E9ACB8770CC1CF4EBC30E32E3D816EE170453CA93CA7EA60A329F728C6E29B7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7190-3683","documentHash":"350c51a6-178b-45f0-ba79-d8fde881460e"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a0473989c9","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Górszczyk","uuid":"0A6AE9F1EC9A1C443C1601B910B3422E361203C041A5225F1AAF35894B9C2763A7BC803BACC3400B7D1931FDD885C2A176CCC58E5930BA848AE9C0703A7D0641","orcidId":"0000-0002-9767-2772","documentHash":"c13106bc-e029-46e2-a892-271c4a59eaa7"}],"objectId":"635bd445409707035d11206d","doi":"10.5194/se-13-1065-2022","publicUri":"https://se.copernicus.org/articles/13/1065/2022/se-13-1065-2022.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"3D high-resolution seismic imaging of the iron oxide deposits in Ludvika (Sweden) using full-waveform inversion and reverse time migration","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A sparse 3D seismic survey was acquired over the Blötberget iron oxide deposits of the Ludvika Mines in south-central Sweden. The main aim of the survey was to delineate the deeper extension of the mineralisation and to better understand its 3D nature and associated fault systems for mine planning purposes. To obtain a high-quality seismic image in depth, we applied time-domain 3D acoustic full-waveform inversion (FWI) to build a high-resolution P-wave velocity model. This model was subsequently used for pre-stack depth imaging with reverse time migration (RTM) to produce the complementary reflectivity section. We developed a data preprocessing workflow and inversion strategy for the successful implementation of FWI in the hardrock environment. We obtained a high-fidelity velocity model using FWI and assessed its robustness. We extensively tested and optimised the parameters associated with the RTM method for subsequent depth imaging using different velocity models: a constant velocity model, a model built using first-arrival travel-time tomography and a velocity model derived by FWI. We compare our RTM results with a priori data available in the area. We conclude that, from all tested velocity models, the FWI velocity model in combination with the subsequent RTM step provided the most focussed image of the mineralisation and we successfully mapped its 3D geometrical nature. In particular, a major reflector interpreted as a cross-cutting fault, which is restricting the deeper extension of the mineralisation with depth, and several other fault structures which were earlier not imaged were also delineated. We believe that a thorough analysis of the depth images derived with the combined FWI–RTM approach that we present here can provide more details which will help with better estimation of areas with high mineralisation, better mine planning and safety measures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709297878c28a0473989c9","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","5e7094e7878c28a0473c668b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1065-1085","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094e7878c28a0473c668b","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","5e709297878c28a0473989c9","635bd445409707035d11206f","635bd445409707035d112070","635bd445409707035d112071","635bd445409707035d112072"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454797b7","mniswId":"18696","title":"Solid Earth","issn":"1869-9510","eissn":"1869-9529","documentHash":"d8d372d4-6d6f-47af-a39b-a2fee2edd1a6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"635bd445409707035d11206e","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"6","documentHash":"41a363af-14fd-4c50-a914-0445e435ec66"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058282626"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6357b7474097072c1fa14735","name":"Michał","lastName":"Glazer","documentHash":"07b2e8c2-a25e-4125-8db5-a9f0efa46d78"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c990","name":"Artur","lastName":"Marciniak","uuid":"5218C630BD00E1D15FDE8DD95D286784DA876E0E8000313F823180BBF748D7DC9F0A8023A1F90AFE9C5AD5782E365D07C763275DF0F9E05D63FA3DF6DD9BDA9E","documentHash":"64902d05-2f25-441a-b4b1-d9cdb1529f5c"},{"objectId":"60a763e69543c758682b6462","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Owoc","uuid":"C3BE9C17C052EEE31998B2C2863BFD09672CB888B5A43DFB2DE8B37A9145FE4964116AABE8FF30A37DEF50464557E03ACF88E7F815F10E5A032569328E561EE4","documentHash":"c77701a1-449a-4c83-b53b-54eb40160a65"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Osuch","uuid":"A15CE4704BFC55F4D73C5551A1BF8F722C8079811C8D2926C74DE5E2098F109CCBA98FF443EA760E7212470B8FEC3F616067AD3C9D8E6C8BEC9D2B1C3908DE94","orcidId":"0000-0002-1887-3569","documentHash":"447f1351-672a-4b79-b06d-7741f68786bb"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Majdański","uuid":"89D7E80830B607723CEFEDCFBDA5FC52ECA8EFD548784730711C4D8752516F3FD892A2BCEDA865B4737074B27716938ACD71EC45855B87BECB169C65C89CD172","orcidId":"0000-0002-8909-4407","documentHash":"0b6165bd-7e9b-4ab0-9954-9e96b9ceabf6"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"C0584C144462F702B3240BEAC5B59EE267B2C41FD0108E80ADE2625711EBE1965DBD3F8183578828BBA3059F994E33D86CACFD8B0B3788616E7BE27271E913B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3393-753X","documentHash":"e1b00415-43de-446c-8e75-68765156a8a8"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f06b","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Dobiński","uuid":"A73C6E5AB3408580C89A8EA6D95F03AEE6B7B55854A5B76E1EB8D352644B6BC5225EADDF3C51AAC567468CB6AB1B5AF0AF518065B94C8FAA4B28029BE06DCAA6","orcidId":"0000-0002-6249-7273","documentHash":"c4de0425-1f96-495d-9313-e7f2b286b757"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-04-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6357b7474097072c1fa14734","doi":"10.24425/ppr.2022.140363","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/140363/edition/123018/content","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Multi-method geophysical mapping of ground properties and periglacial geomorphology in Hans Glacier forefield, SW Spitsbergen","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article presents the results of a geophysical survey from which detailed images of glacial and periglacial landforms and subsurface structures were obtained. Sediments and landforms on newly deglaciated terrain can be used to reconstruct the extent and character of glaciers in the past and add to the understanding of their response to climate and environmental changes. To derive spatial information from complex geomorphological terrain, joint interpretation of three non-intrusive geophysical methods were applied: Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), and time-lapse Seismic Tomography. These were used to identify subsurface structures in the forefield of the retreating Hans Glacier in SW Spitsbergen, Svalbard. Three main zones were distinguished and described: outwash plain, terminal moraine from the last glacial maximum, and glacial forefield proximal to the glacier front. Geophysical profiles across these zones reveal information on glacio-fluvial sediment thickness and structure, ice thickness and structure, and bedrock topography. The freezing-thawing effect of the active layer has a strong and deep impact, as demonstrated by variations in P-wave velocity in the obtained outcomes. The results are discussed in the context of the current climate in Svalbard. This study provides a snapshot of ground parameters and the current state of the subsurface in southern Spitsbergen. The boundary between sediment-bedrock layers was estimated to be from 5 to 20 m in depth. It is the first such extensive description of periglacial structures in the forefield of the Hans Glacier, utilising the longest ERT profile (1500 m) in Svalbard together with deep GPR and precise seismic tomography."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60a763e69543c758682b6462","5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","62c796a8752340480571c990","5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e7878c28a04739f06b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"43","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"101-123","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c796a8752340480571c990","5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","60a763e69543c758682b6462","5e7092e7878c28a04739f06b","6357b7474097072c1fa14735","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479306","mniswId":"16309","title":"Polish Polar Research","issn":"0138-0338","eissn":"2081-8262","websiteLink":"http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/popore","documentHash":"81e58de4-37b7-4e45-bc40-acee2ad2db77"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058282694"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64cd4c6f4097077ac1e1e2d0","name":"Michał","lastName":"Laska","documentHash":"5751a6a6-733f-47b7-98ee-c9396c675cfd"},{"objectId":"64cd4c6f4097077ac1e1e2cd","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Gądek","documentHash":"cf393d10-3c26-4f98-80c0-8b9cff8b9522"},{"objectId":"64cd4c6f4097077ac1e1e2c9","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Migała","documentHash":"07ec04fb-b859-47d5-bd31-9a405d91cc77"},{"objectId":"5ebeda99752340254fc4195b","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Puczko","uuid":"9306E74A902E2A10F1AC7AEC17145E85D2CDC41CEE3D343495A65CFC0E2582CA410EACD7560DA4951331802F5F20B08E8ADF4E9B21098DEA1C37B76F650CF41A","documentHash":"546355e7-00d8-4a6f-a268-3fd8fd285f3a"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b587f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Głowacki","uuid":"ADCBCCA81F1A06B7130C3C6D09DD944575C8A72EA3ED5557187A4DA4FC6B5AA65790B81C23EED987E61140DC70B02C3B0AE8F3AE98A984E10E6E43AC6988A232","orcidId":"0000-0003-1943-0900","documentHash":"1765fc1d-e50c-4fb1-b782-9a66d6e3d4cc"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Luks","uuid":"FC0F8C1A25CDF854727B23DAF6DD04D1AD9513696FBFA8C968355CC0EFB6A3BDEB4F2A5DDD1AE5371489624E4D31807972D8B5C54FCC96768719FBBC97225A9F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2287-385X","documentHash":"3f73f8a6-7975-4c35-be1a-579f2ca67494"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af538","name":"Michał","lastName":"Pętlicki","uuid":"34B9D7F1D68AD630696F1A83D529248F5B045AB9CBEB2FA22A96FE97B4A137E3E535DDCAC67648E6D0687C336C34C3F1FC558111F8A3665C193D24C1088F0310","orcidId":"0000-0003-3383-2586","documentHash":"33ccc5bd-144b-4201-b9ca-06801bc2add4"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a23c8","name":"Adam","lastName":"Nawrot","uuid":"62E26EB8A7FD937B6F4EC478E5F86852F14D84281B3DDBE242AA1B58FF7741578B6ECC7A4C19192C210949FB912077FF7C3A914E35B207156C9A9722F02B6B1A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6619-6478","documentHash":"c0165202-67c7-4155-873c-b372458e73bc"},{"objectId":"5e7092cd878c28a04739cfc2","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Kępski","uuid":"8B8B42BF62B9EF5821CE12225FBCCBCEEDFE0C661C50ED9482644A8E8F415D55B42E624B1ECFB4C8926737FD6263D0CB83A53459CAAABED7D60E5B13BBCE5F52","orcidId":"0000-0001-7903-2942","documentHash":"1b930ff0-ee6a-4e98-bc2e-eced13e511f4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"635fd2524097072cf4e717f1","doi":"10.1038/s41597-022-01767-8","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01767-8","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Hansbreen Snowpit Dataset : over 30-year of detailed snow research on an Arctic glacier","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Snow cover is a key element in the water cycle, global heat balance and in the condition of glaciers. Characterised by high temporal and spatial variability, it is subject to short- and long-term changes in climatic conditions. This paper presents a unique dataset of snow measurements on Hansbreen, an Arctic glacier in Svalbard. The dataset includes 79 archived snow profiles performed from 1989 to 2021. It presents all available observations of physical properties for snow cover, such as grain shape and size, hardness, wetness, temperature and density, supplemented with organised metadata. All data has been revised and unified with current protocols and the present International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground, allowing comparison of data from different periods and locations. The information included is essential for estimations of glacier mass balance or snow depth using indirect methods, such as ground-penetrating radar.

This study evaluates the potential of the source rock in the Infracambrian rock sequence (Salt Range Formation) based on surface geochemical surveys, Rock–Eval pyrolysis, source biomarkers, geophysical characterization, and seismic inversion using machine learning for maturity index estimation. Core samples of Infracambrian rock were extracted for Rock–Eval pyrolysis and biomarker characterization. Additionally, 81 geomicrobial soil and gas samples were collected from the surface to explore the petroleum system and potential source rocks in the subsurface. Advanced interpretation techniques were used to investigate the origin and concentration of hydrocarbon gases at the surface, including Rock–Eval pyrolysis, thermal maturity, source biomarkers, and the environment of deposition of organic matter. The results show that the investigated samples are characterized by restricted marine clay devoid of sedimentary carbonate facies with thermal maturity in the early stage of the oil generation window. The seismic inverted maturity index profile demonstrates a reasonable correlation of thermal maturity with the biomarkers and Rock–Eval pyrolysis. Further scrutiny of the surface geochemical samples confirms the presence of higher concentrations of thermogenic C2–C4 hydrocarbons in the vicinity of anticlinal structures, suggesting the existence of an effective migration path along deep-seated faults to the surface. This study concludes that the Infracambrian rocks on the eastern flank of Pakistan are thicker, thermally mature, and have deep-seated structural closures, indicating a greater probability of heavy and light oil in this area than in the Bikaner–Nagaur Basin, India."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62b521a9752340195a384ba4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62b521a9752340195a384ba4","62c2ec2b40970721cb920e67","62c2ec2b40970721cb920e68","62c2ec2b40970721cb920e69","62c2ec2b40970721cb920e6a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6204e9a22467f04219d00aa3","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"1","documentHash":"6f277079-92a2-4906-a3fd-56acdd571480"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058301588"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b20","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Mizerski","uuid":"701B5D7D7AA53237569495D5318BA2683F6DF807391F02B976FEF27D347B20C6E279FAE1B0847BD7F143C52FAEB1B8D66FFAF9137A85F82AF6B7352A818AD837","orcidId":"0000-0003-0106-675X","documentHash":"fc47a420-7054-45f8-8d61-5c0327b8bf67"}],"objectId":"6385c54140970769ab6a045b","doi":"10.24423/aom.4086","publicUri":"https://am.ippt.pan.pl/am/article/viewFile/v74p409/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Anisotropic turbulent viscosity and large-scale motive force in thermally driven turbulence at low Prandtl number","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The fully developed turbulent Boussinesq convection is known to form\nlarge-scale rolls, often termed the ‘large-scale circulation’ (LSC).

The traverse passes from amphibolite-grade gneisses in the north to granulite-grade rocks (charnockite) in the south. Changes include whole-rock depletion of Rb, Cs, Th, and U in the granulite grade rocks as relative to the amphibolite grade gneisses, and oxidation trends regionally from highly oxidised granulite-facies rocks near the magnetite–haematite buffer to relatively reduced amphibolite-facies rocks below the fayalite-magnetite-quartz. Rare earth elements show limited mobility and are hosted a variety of minerals whose presence is dependent on the metamorphic grade ranging from titanite and allanite in the amphibolite-facies rocks to monazite in the vicinity of the orthopyroxene-in isograd to apatite in the granulite-grade charnockite. Cathodoluminescence and back-scattered electron sub-grain imaging and sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe analysis of zircon from 29 samples of dioritic, tonalitic, and granitic orthogneiss from the traverse reveals magmatic zircon cores that record the emplacement of the granitoid protoliths mostly about 2580 to 2550 Ma, along with a few older mid to late Archean tonalites. Protolith zircon was modified during metamorphism by overgrowth and/or replacement. Relative to igneous cores, U-enriched metamorphic zircon, dominant in the amphibolite-grade gneisses, formed at ca. 2530 Ma, predating retrograde titanite growth at ca. 2500 Ma. Uranium-depleted mantles grew on zircon between 2530 and 2500 Ma in granulite-grade samples south of the orthopyroxene-in isograd. In some of these samples, the U-depleted metamorphic zircon is preceded by mantles of U-undepleted zircon, indicating a progression of metamorphic zircon growth with increasingly depleted compositions between 2530 and 2500 Ma. With increasing metamorphic grade (from amphibolite to granulite) and oxidation state, allanite and monazite disappear from the assemblage and zircon became depleted in U and Th. Whole-rock U-Th compositions became decoupled from relict magmatic zircon compositions, reflecting the development of U-depleted metamorphic zircon and indicating that whole-rock chemical differences along the traverse were produced during metamorphism, rather than just reflecting differences in dioritic vs granitic protoliths. Although in situ anatexis and melt extraction may have played a role, whole-rock and zircon depletion of trace elements can be explained by the action of externally derived, oxidising, low-H2O activity hypersaline fluids migrating up through the mid to lower crust. Fluids and element migration during metamorphism may be the end result of subduction related processes that cumulated in the collision and concatenation of island arcs and continental blocks.

spatially and temporally due to diverse pedo-climatic and hydrologic conditions, as well as variations in exposure and vulnerability, such as demographics and response actions. While hazard severity and frequency of past drought events have been studied in detail, little is known about the effect of drought management strategies on the actual impacts and how the hazard is perceived by relevant stakeholders. In a continental study, we characterised and assessed the impacts and the perceptions of two recent drought events (2018 and 2019) in Europe and examined the relationship between management strategies and drought perception, hazard, and impact. The study was based on a pan-European survey involving national representatives from 28 countries and relevant stakeholders responding to a standard questionnaire. The survey focused on collecting information on stakeholders' perceptions of drought, impacts on water resources and beyond, water availability, and current drought management strategies on national and regional scales. The survey results were compared with the actual drought hazard information registered by the European Drought Observatory (EDO) for 2018 and 2019. The results highlighted high diversity in drought perception across different countries and in values of the implemented drought management strategies to alleviate impacts by increasing national and sub-national awareness and resilience. The study identifies an urgent need to further reduce drought impacts by constructing and implementing a European macro-level drought governance approach, such as a directive, which would strengthen national drought management and mitigate damage to human and natural assets."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"2201-2217","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63a16af94097073ee82d3314","63a16af94097073ee82d3315","63a16af94097073ee82d3316","63a16af94097073ee82d3317","63a16af94097073ee82d3318","63a16af94097073ee82d3319","63a16af94097073ee82d331a","63a16af94097073ee82d331b","63a16af94097073ee82d331c","63a16af94097073ee82d331d","63a16af94097073ee82d331e","63a16af94097073ee82d331f","63a16af94097073ee82d3320","63a16af94097073ee82d3321","63a16af94097073ee82d3322","63a16af94097073ee82d3323","63a16af94097073ee82d3324","63a16af94097073ee82d3325","63a16af94097073ee82d3326","63a16af94097073ee82d3327","63a16af94097073ee82d3328","63a16af94097073ee82d3329","63a16af94097073ee82d332a","63a16af94097073ee82d332b","63a16af94097073ee82d332c","63a16af94097073ee82d332d","5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","63a16af94097073ee82d332e","63a16af94097073ee82d332f","63a16af94097073ee82d3330","63a16af94097073ee82d3331","63a16af94097073ee82d3332","63a16af94097073ee82d3333","63a16af94097073ee82d3334","63a16af94097073ee82d3335","63a16af94097073ee82d3336","63a16af94097073ee82d3337","63a16af94097073ee82d3338","63a16af94097073ee82d3339","63a16af94097073ee82d333a","63a16af94097073ee82d333b","63a16af94097073ee82d333c","63a16af94097073ee82d333d","63a16af94097073ee82d333e","63a16af94097073ee82d333f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f6b","mniswId":"14788","title":"Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences","issn":"1561-8633","eissn":"1684-9981","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"d98bb9d4-780d-45c2-bf85-522eea1fde1b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a16af94097073ee82d3313","year":"2022","volume":"22","number":"6","documentHash":"608c0dd6-dad7-4c1b-af71-a05ae40bc699"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058359950"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"602ce4ca9543c7410626e4f8","name":"Marta","lastName":"Majerska","uuid":"2A924016FE505B19F9EE96E83EFBFDC70D0F5480C96355C38F3900B80157D5D871C6672FB8C58E2BE23FCF034FB0757F01F224E7C337B10F2404A6A549B89558","documentHash":"de93beb5-346e-4229-a4dd-f30619e49101"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Osuch","uuid":"A15CE4704BFC55F4D73C5551A1BF8F722C8079811C8D2926C74DE5E2098F109CCBA98FF443EA760E7212470B8FEC3F616067AD3C9D8E6C8BEC9D2B1C3908DE94","orcidId":"0000-0002-1887-3569","documentHash":"447f1351-672a-4b79-b06d-7741f68786bb"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"C0584C144462F702B3240BEAC5B59EE267B2C41FD0108E80ADE2625711EBE1965DBD3F8183578828BBA3059F994E33D86CACFD8B0B3788616E7BE27271E913B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3393-753X","documentHash":"e1b00415-43de-446c-8e75-68765156a8a8"}],"objectId":"63a165e24097073ee82d19d5","doi":"10.1016/j.accre.2022.05.001","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1674927822000570?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Changes in hydrological regime in High Arctic non-glaciated catchment in 1979–2020 using a multimodel approach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Assessing hydrological consequences of climate change at the catchment scale is recently among key problems in hydrology. This study focuses on the estimation of changes in the hydrological regime in the Fuglebekken catchment in SW Spitsbergen (Svalbard). For this purpose, 50 rainfall-runoff models were calibrated using available hydrometeorological observations. The models were validated based on archival flow and SWE observations, and proxy data from time-lapse cameras. Six models (FLEX-IS, GSM-SOCONT, PRMS, HBV, Nordic HBV, and GR4J) with the best performance were applied to reconstruct the past hydrological conditions and analyse the trends in flow regime in the period 1979–2020. Statistically significant changes at 0.05 level in the flow regime indicators were detected, including the number of days with the active flow during the calendar year (10.8 d per decade), during the mid-May‒November period (9.8 d per decade), the date of the first day with the flow (−4.7 d per decade), and the last day with the flow during mid-May‒November (8.4 d per decade). A statistically significant increase in runoff was estimated for two periods from mid-May to the end of June and the second part of August till mid-November. The changes in the first period result from increases in air temperature and earlier snowmelt-driven floods. An estimated runoff increase in the second period corresponds to large increases in rainfall. The increase in air temperature, earlier disappearance of snow, and decrease in precipitation in July and the first part of August result in runoff reduction.

Outdoor dust (particulate matter smaller than 10 μm, PM10) was collected by means of a PM sampler that was placed in the yard of the building of the Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences (IG PAS), in Warsaw, Poland. Indoor dust samples were collected with the same type of PM sampler, placed inside this building. The magnetic methods were applied for the estimation of concentration and magnetic mineralogy of the magnetic particles present in PM. Magnetic measurements, such as low and high-temperature dependence of volume magnetic susceptibility κ(T), hysteresis parameters, and frequency dependence of mass magnetic susceptibility χfd show that outdoor and indoor PM contain ultra-fine-grained magnetite-like minerals, particularly in a size range < 30 nm. This pointed to the common outdoor sources of pollution intruding inside the building through windows, ventilation systems, and partly carried on dresses by people. The mass of PM10 collected outdoors is of the same range as the mass of PM10 from inside the building. The mass susceptibility of indoor filters, however, is about 1/3 of the mass susceptibility of outdoor filters. The relationship between volume susceptibility and mass indicates a relatively homogenous composition of indoor dust but a varying composition of outdoor dust, with a variable influx of nonmagnetic exogenous particles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b3878c28a0473af6d7","5e70944d878c28a0473ba086","5e70944d878c28a0473ba089","5e7094b2878c28a0473c1bfc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"206","pagesFromTo":"104804","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba089","5e7094b2878c28a0473c1bfc","5e70944d878c28a0473ba086","5e7093b3878c28a0473af6d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547847d","mniswId":"10160","title":"JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS","issn":"0926-9851","eissn":"1879-1859","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e53bb3e7-ea56-4547-998f-9f369ad7cbe0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632ae67740970732c4af2afe","year":"2022","volume":"206","documentHash":"5ea478ea-633b-4375-8ddd-b197be03526d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058367898"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"639c269b409707327114eda5","name":"Richard","lastName":"Wirth","documentHash":"857e84e5-1bcb-4c9e-9ce3-aa6a029c386e"},{"objectId":"639c269b409707327114eda4","name":"Anja","lastName":"Schreiber","documentHash":"06b4c46f-9dd8-45bb-aef5-c63b6d3698b1"},{"objectId":"639c269b409707327114eda3","name":"Franziska","lastName":"Wilke","documentHash":"a9905878-6c33-47e3-9f1d-0a371b605ed9"},{"objectId":"639c269b409707327114eda2","name":"Harry","lastName":"Becker","documentHash":"bebfeb6e-29f0-4f19-a905-412d3240e5b2"},{"objectId":"639c269b409707327114eda1","name":"Dennis","lastName":"Vanderliek","documentHash":"09f0e003-7221-4078-8bc2-c295e8596106"},{"objectId":"639c269b409707327114eda0","name":"Elizaveta","lastName":"Kovaleva","documentHash":"87a3b9e9-1869-44d2-a923-39dc2f3e3148"},{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kusiak","uuid":"3052A19F570F1180C90FE5ED9510A53FCEA3A401B154BB701C443A248D410748C9CFEB65CF60BA418E2ECBD9AAFA204B99C32FF77545357BEC09625DF52F2ECD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2042-8621","documentHash":"10e63152-d296-4f9a-9487-cad0a39065f2"}],"objectId":"639c269b409707327114ed9e","doi":"10.1007/s00410-022-01977-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00410-022-01977-8.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Nano- and micro-structures in lunar zircon from Apollo 15 and 16 impactites: implications for age interpretations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Meteorite impact processes are ubiquitous on the surfaces of rocky and icy bodies in the Solar System, including the Moon. One of the most common accessory minerals, zircon, when shocked, produces specific micro-structures that may become indicative of the age and shock conditions of these impact processes. To better understand the shock mechanisms in zircon from Apollo 15 and 16 impact breccias, we applied transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and studied nano-structures in eight lunar zircons displaying four different morphologies from breccias 15455, 67915, and 67955. Our observations revealed a range of shock-related features in zircon: (1) planar and non-planar fractures, (2) “columnar” zircon rims around baddeleyite cores, (3) granular textured zircon, in most cases with sub-µm-size inclusions of monoclinic ZrO2 (baddeleyite) and cubic ZrO2 (zirconia), (4) silica-rich glass and metal inclusions of FeS and FeNi present at triple junctions in granular zircon and in baddeleyite, (5) inclusions of rutile in shocked baddeleyite, (6) amorphous domains, (7) recrystallized domains. In many grain aggregates, shock-related micro-structures overprint each other, indicating either different stages of a single impact process or multiple impact events. During shock, some zircons were transformed to diaplectic glass (6), and others (7) were completely decomposed into SiO2 and Zr-oxide, evident from the observed round shapes of cubic zirconia and silica-rich glass filling triple junctions of zircon granules. Despite the highly variable effect on textures and Zr phases, shock-related features show no correlation with relatively homogeneous U–Pb or 207Pb/206Pb ages of zircons. Either the shock events occurred very soon after the solidification or recrystallization of the different Zr phases, or the shock events were too brief to result in noticeable Pb loss during shock metamorphism."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"177","issue":"12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6","639c269b409707327114eda0","639c269b409707327114eda1","639c269b409707327114eda2","639c269b409707327114eda3","639c269b409707327114eda4","639c269b409707327114eda5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777ef","mniswId":"4403","title":"Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology","issn":"0010-7999","eissn":"1432-0967","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"7519218d-07cc-4b2c-9af3-7b8d643ed822"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"639c269b409707327114ed9f","year":"2022","volume":"177","number":"12","documentHash":"3ed3e10c-8a1e-400a-a007-70f96685e8fd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lunar zircon Nanostructures Zircon textures Baddeleyite Cubic zirconia"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058375965"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63a2ed00409707633a23eeb7","name":"Silvia","lastName":"Gazzola","documentHash":"ce60e318-5f23-4cce-b09b-8eb2a68df373"},{"objectId":"626c9f287523406b88d07165","name":"Ali","lastName":"Gholami","uuid":"2ECFC5AEAA28B4DAD17F4C5C0367B433AF78932977245DE38DB09A380B3BFA2863C72FB1FB8D83DF61D772FF31E66FC0BF8B853605CF814E843959FE40EB305B","documentHash":"244d54a5-c672-476b-ae86-a8fdf8a92e8d"}],"objectId":"63a2ed00409707633a23eeb5","doi":"10.1007/s10543-022-00934-y","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10543-022-00934-y.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Automatic balancing parameter selection for Tikhonov-TV regularization","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper considers large-scale linear ill-posed inverse problems whose solutions can be represented as sums of smooth and piecewise constant components. To solve such problems we consider regularizers consisting of two terms that must be balanced. Namely, a Tikhonov term guarantees the smoothness of the smooth solution component, while a total-variation (TV) regularizer promotes blockiness of the non-smooth solution component. A scalar parameter allows to balance between these two terms and, hence, to appropriately separate and regularize the smooth and non-smooth components of the solution. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm to solve this regularization problem by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, a novel algorithm for automatic choice of the balancing parameter is introduced, using robust statistics. The proposed approach is supported by some theoretical analysis, and numerical experiments concerned with different inverse problems are presented to validate the choice of the balancing parameter."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["626c9f287523406b88d07165"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"62","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1873-1898","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["626c9f287523406b88d07165","63a2ed00409707633a23eeb7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773ad","mniswId":"2568","title":"Bit Numerical Mathematics","issn":"0006-3835","eissn":"1572-9125","websiteLink":"https://link.springer.com/journal/10543","documentHash":"ea38cb64-e1c7-44fd-a877-896dd78bbff5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a2ed00409707633a23eeb6","year":"2022","volume":"62","number":"4","documentHash":"dcdf1fb1-818c-4108-90d0-4ff89f9d8a48"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Tikhonov-TV regularization ADMM Regularization parameter selection Inverse problems"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058379512"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7cb4","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Dębowski","uuid":"C28DE0FEC313FA4721DFC4D12368A684F2A40434509869BD326F308E5F1307AA2C0A55B8EB145F8E8409D1F5074055B5FCC6138EB4F24A069D88F2AAAF613ED5","orcidId":"0000-0001-5405-8433","documentHash":"688b5455-43c2-4d06-95f0-ab29f4ea64dc"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b78fc","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Mrokowska","uuid":"636A3DA215291C1A0EA508E0E58EB0F691CFAD76743086AB5B5EFE99C0F4E04721F2A9A94FF6280DA2B9FD763F37A8656FF39E02ACCEBEE7158E85350635DCEB","orcidId":"0000-0002-3135-7315","documentHash":"7312b744-ebc7-41f4-960c-40ab6a6faddd"},{"objectId":"5e709327878c28a0473a3c39","name":"Anna","lastName":"Krztoń-Maziopa","uuid":"EC0454313F9B467159026149FF2BDF327C23D941999CCA426D59E1514B86EAE6B67FA9FDDE711263F80676145B58815ED47E8097F59F98256D4B0F2322095CD8","orcidId":"0000-0002-0223-0614","documentHash":"9df68760-3b55-44b7-b98e-3382f7eca027"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"633d5562409707220fbdee7c","doi":"10.1016/j.marchem.2022.104163","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304420322000809","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of exopolymer gels on the viscoelasticity of mucus-rich saltwater and settling dynamics of particles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Algal blooms enrich seawater with gel-like exopolymers modifying the local structure and physio-chemical properties of water column. These effects are particularly intense during mucilage events occurring seasonally in some seas and coastal regions and in thin layers. However, detailed in situ examination is limited, and the effects of biologically modified seawater on microscale processes remain poorly understood. In this study, we experimentally investigated the impact of exopolymer gels on rheological properties of mucus-rich saltwater and consequences on settling dynamics of fast-sinking particles using aqueous solutions of sodium chloride with an addition of xanthan gum, a model exopolymer forming gels dispersed in water. We studied two types of solutions: colloidal dispersion and dispersion with predominant content of particulate gels. The results showed that dispersions consisting of colloidal exopolymers have stronger inner structure than dispersions with predominant particulate exopolymers, suggesting that viscoelastic properties of seawater vary with the structure of gels. Settling velocity and drag exerted on solid spheres and disks were substantially different for the two types of solutions, with the drag coefficient up to six times higher for colloidal than for particulate solutions of corresponding salinity, indicating that colloidal exopolymers may retard particles falling in marine environment more effectively than particulate gels. The findings highlight possible variation in viscoelasticity of mucus-rich saltwater with exopolymer network structure changes in spatial and temporal scales during algal bloom development and implications to the sedimentation of fast-sinking particles such as faecal pellets, carbonate grains, minerals and microplastics"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942c878c28a0473b78fc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"246","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942c878c28a0473b78fc","5e709327878c28a0473a3c39","5e709430878c28a0473b7cb4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d66","mniswId":"13909","title":"Marine Chemistry","issn":"0304-4203","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"31e96c48-5374-4f9a-beed-015606317f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"663a053d4097077c1aa8274a","year":"2022","volume":"","number":"246","doi":"","documentHash":"9be6237b-4006-442c-b899-ef2c391d4644"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["marine gels","xanthan gum","viscoelasticity","sedimentation","drag","non-Newtonian fluid","algal bloom","mucilage","fast-sinking particles"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058382847"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"634e9538409707350c329690","name":"Naser","lastName":"Golsanami","documentHash":"6d30921f-b8f3-447a-a49e-567f379d61e4"},{"objectId":"634e9538409707350c32968f","name":"Rizwan Sarwar","lastName":"Awan","documentHash":"2bf43f50-b141-4a97-bf8d-8acd42f329e7"},{"objectId":"62e88c28752340480578b5a4","name":"Qamar","lastName":"Yasin","uuid":"D54CEB7B0CDAF3A48B113D909E3285151FEE88E6B1641749FF6FC5DCDC64F45F5C67C4E89F3FB3F2377F63EFD212C8C6CA1F496A4995D102CF18C27167BC0EAD","documentHash":"94b867df-ead9-4157-a232-70bdf81d1cdd"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Majdański","uuid":"89D7E80830B607723CEFEDCFBDA5FC52ECA8EFD548784730711C4D8752516F3FD892A2BCEDA865B4737074B27716938ACD71EC45855B87BECB169C65C89CD172","orcidId":"0000-0002-8909-4407","documentHash":"0b6165bd-7e9b-4ab0-9954-9e96b9ceabf6"}],"objectId":"634e9538409707350c32968e","doi":"10.3390/en15197368","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/19/7368/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"An Analytical Hierarchy-Based Method for Quantifying Hydraulic Fracturing Stimulation to Improve Geothermal Well Productivity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hydraulic fracturing (HF) has been used for years to enhance oil and gas production from conventional and unconventional reservoirs. HF in enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) has become increasingly common in recent years. In EGS, hydraulic fracturing creates a geothermal collector in impermeable or low-permeable hot dry rocks. Artificial fracture networks in the collector allow for a continuous flow of fluid in a loop connecting at least two wells (injector and producer). However, it is challenging to assess the fracability of geothermal reservoirs for EGS. Consequently, it is necessary to design a method that considers multiple parameters when evaluating the potential of geothermal development. This study proposes an improved fracability index model (FI) based on the influences of fracability-related geomechanical and petrophysical properties. These include brittle minerals composition, fracture toughness, minimum horizontal in-situ stress, a brittleness index model, and temperature effect to quantify the rock’s fracability. The hierarchical analytic framework was designed based on the correlation between the influencing factors and rock fracability. The results of the qualitative and quantitative approaches were integrated into a mathematical evaluation model. The improved fracability index model’s reliability was evaluated using well logs and 3D seismic data on low-permeable carbonate geothermal reservoirs and shale gas horizontal wells. The results reveal that the improved FI model effectively demonstrates brittle regions in the low-permeable carbonate geothermal reservoir and long horizontal section of shale reservoir. We divide the rock fracability into three levels: FI > 0.59 (the rock fracability is good); 0.59 > FI > 0.32 (the rock fracability is medium); and FI < 0.32, (the rock fracability is poor). The improved FI model can assist in resolving the uncertainties associated with fracability interpretation in determining the optimum location of perforation clusters for hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation in enhanced geothermal systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","62e88c28752340480578b5a4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"7368","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62e88c28752340480578b5a4","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","634e9538409707350c32968f","634e9538409707350c329690"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","websiteLink":"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/energies","documentHash":"1ee025d1-7cd7-4556-813f-e4634f40a6fc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632c56884097076d6d457221","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"19","documentHash":"e1d022ef-6512-483e-9abb-935273649c69"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["enhanced geothermal systems; fracability index; hydraulic fracturing; carbonate reservoirs; seismic inversion"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058398107"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094cd878c28a0473c41ff","name":"Michał","lastName":"Bućko","uuid":"5B85F2A9DF07064BBFC99BBEBDE2D45DEB4CCDFDEE822A1A741ADA536429E998CA613E3D8E3CB33416536883AB7B9264060040346E5BD0C63109C2A632B923B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7252-6779","documentHash":"36ba793d-7038-4a73-95d4-7f9708b34e25"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b","name":"Beata","lastName":"Górka-Kostrubiec","uuid":"837CE8D75E0ECD3E327460670495F33AD004F18316960AEE744DCB63710EB639069A5F2B1240E8B20E21AC170FC616C7D7E9D246798C609ADE31FA8E049F61DF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6337-7583","documentHash":"2b3d8aa3-c2a8-4bd0-a8fa-dd1830c1e138"},{"objectId":"5e709333878c28a0473a4c1b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wawer-Liszka","uuid":"127109FAF6C2ED9225D1FCD63E44C4F03B21BFDEC2CAE3ACDF3C1D39D0EB80B28F95BCEFB331390FEFE4DD68543B723CF8C34982960B30EAD7CB5F57D8412664","orcidId":"0000-0001-9276-0880","documentHash":"52371167-e262-42d5-aea1-2cfb6ba3d5c6"},{"objectId":"5e70924c878c28a04739358a","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Magiera","uuid":"8DFB9D12693983007DFC1B462F93C8D69F89A3C9ED35383C1DBBA2CAAB16DC45803AE54FBB073638CE6B9B0CBDD9F5F51A2B82BD784DBF08B74AFEDEB0D23954","orcidId":"0000-0002-8799-9421","documentHash":"4d63f7fc-7408-41d4-89f1-f56378ad4d37"}],"objectId":"63b2ae454097074fedfe2908","doi":"10.1016/j.jappgeo.2022.104874","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926985122003457","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Ecological quality of the “Torfowisko pod Węglińcem” nature reserve (SW Poland) based on magnetic and geochemical studies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this research a combination of magnetic, geochemical and microscopic techniques was used to investigate the ombrothropic peat bog, which covers the “Torfowisko pod Węglińcem” nature reserve, situated in south-western Poland. Hysteresis parameters and measurements of magnetic susceptibility show that the surface layer (∼15 cm) of the protected peat bog area is contaminated by strongly-magnetic materials e.g. low-coercivity magnetite. Geochemical analyses revealed higher concentrations of certain chemical elements (e.g. Li, Al, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ga, Ba and Pb) in the approximately 10 cm surface peat layer. The vertical distribution of the magnetic susceptibility and most of the analyzed chemical elements exhibit strong correlation and this demonstrates that the identified anthropogenic contaminants accumulate via atmospheric deposition. The microscopic analyses of the magnetic material separated from the peat samples identified two types of metal-rich particulates: spherules and irregularly shaped particles including an octahedral magnetic crystals (mean diameter of both types ∼10–300 μm). The magnetic bi-plots show that even finer magnetic grains (<10 μm) may be found at the studied area. The radiocarbon (14C) dating of the surface samples suggests that the formation of the contaminated top peat layer has occurred during last 300 years. In such case the analyzed magnetic material may be the proof of both: historical as well as the present atmospheric deposition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debe","uid":"b0wQuhcVyL-cE8jATY9xI9g","uuid":"f42a8e3b-c36b-40b0-8cd8-653e97eb8406","name":"Instytut Podstaw Inżynierii Środowiska Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924c878c28a04739358a","5e709333878c28a0473a4c1b","5e7094cd878c28a0473c41ff"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debe","parentUuid":"f42a8e3b-c36b-40b0-8cd8-653e97eb8406","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debe","rootUuid":"f42a8e3b-c36b-40b0-8cd8-653e97eb8406","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"208","pagesFromTo":"104874","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094cd878c28a0473c41ff","5e70924c878c28a04739358a","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b","5e709333878c28a0473a4c1b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547847d","mniswId":"10160","title":"Journal of Applied Geophysics","issn":"0926-9851","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"021ceb22-e5b1-437c-8c9f-aea14d9e4333"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"663a05934097077c1aa83401","year":"2023","volume":"","number":"208","doi":"","documentHash":"50baa808-2ce0-40c8-9817-eda0da2f53f4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["peat bog","nature reserve","air pollution","magnetic parameters","heavy materials","optical microscopy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058407906"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094cd878c28a0473c41ff","name":"Michał","lastName":"Bućko","uuid":"5B85F2A9DF07064BBFC99BBEBDE2D45DEB4CCDFDEE822A1A741ADA536429E998CA613E3D8E3CB33416536883AB7B9264060040346E5BD0C63109C2A632B923B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7252-6779","documentHash":"36ba793d-7038-4a73-95d4-7f9708b34e25"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b","name":"Beata","lastName":"Górka-Kostrubiec","uuid":"837CE8D75E0ECD3E327460670495F33AD004F18316960AEE744DCB63710EB639069A5F2B1240E8B20E21AC170FC616C7D7E9D246798C609ADE31FA8E049F61DF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6337-7583","documentHash":"2b3d8aa3-c2a8-4bd0-a8fa-dd1830c1e138"},{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a047395bcb","name":"TADEUSZ","lastName":"SZUMIATA","uuid":"597DF16037EDBB2B08289ABCAAE6D56324BE900CE07B91269DEED445A736DE6FA7BB811AFAEDA2F686FEAC523B82AD87DE7C0F6B14783AC3A7FDDD27B332DA06","orcidId":"0000-0003-0430-4805","documentHash":"12ef8566-d584-41de-9992-fb7e40054e8f"},{"objectId":"5e70924c878c28a04739358a","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Magiera","uuid":"8DFB9D12693983007DFC1B462F93C8D69F89A3C9ED35383C1DBBA2CAAB16DC45803AE54FBB073638CE6B9B0CBDD9F5F51A2B82BD784DBF08B74AFEDEB0D23954","orcidId":"0000-0002-8799-9421","documentHash":"4d63f7fc-7408-41d4-89f1-f56378ad4d37"}],"objectId":"63b2a8374097074fedfd9dc8","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161186","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969722082900","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Technogenic magnetic particles in topsoil: Characteristic features for different emission sources","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Variations in mineralogical composition, grain size internal structure and stoichiometry of technogenic magnetic particles (TMPs) deposited in topsoil may provide crucial information necessary to trace main pollution sources and recognize various technological processes. The aim of the study was to characterize, by means of magnetic parameters and Mössbauer spectra, the TMPs from non-ferrous metallurgy, cement, coke, glass production as well as long range transport (LRT) and compare the obtained data with previous results focused on iron mining and metallurgy. This research shows that only certain pollution sources (e.g. mainly iron mining, iron metallurgy, LRT and partly glass production) can be successfully distinguished by the applied parameters. The main features characteristic for TMPs produced by Fe-mining are: high values of concentration-dependent magnetic parameters, low values of coercivity, significant contribution from coarse MD (multi-domain) grains and a relatively high stoichiometry of magnetite. The most discriminative feature for TMPs generated by the glass industry is the abundance of goethite in the topsoil samples, which is confirmed by magnetic and Mössbauer techniques. The TMPs released by the Ni-Cu smelter and the Pb-Zn waste exhibit significant differences in the Mössbauer parameters, indicating different stoichiometry of magnetite for each group. Such variations are due to replacement of Fe by other elements at tetrahedral sites in the case of TMPs released from the Ni-Cu smelter. TMPs characteristic for the LRT emissions contain higher amount of finer fraction of low-stoichiometry magnetite (mostly single-domain SD particles) than those originating from other sources. The TMPs accumulated in the topsoils around the coking plants cannot be clearly discriminated by the applied methodology due to strong influence of the local pollution sources. Magnetic studies of the TMPs generated by cement production are complicated, since their properties mainly depend on individual technology (e.g. additives) used by the local cement plants."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

For this purpose, the study uses the Hansbreen (SW Spitsbergen) records that are among the longest and the most comprehensive snow-cover GPR monitoring records available on Svalbard. While snow depth (HS) is frequently the only feature derived from high-frequency radio-echo sounding (RES), this study also offers an analysis of the physical characteristics (grain shape, size, hardness, and density) of the snow cover structure. We demonstrate that, based on GPR data (800 MHz) and a single snow pit, it is possible to extrapolate the detailed features of snow cover to the accumulation area. Field studies (snow pits and RES) were conducted at the end of selected accumulation seasons in the period 2008–2019, under dry snow conditions and HS close to the maximum. The paper shows that although the snow cover structure varies in space and from season to season, a single snow pit site can represent the entire center line of the accumulation zone. Numerous hard layers (HLs) (up to 30% of the snow column) were observed that reflect progressive climate change, but there is no trend in quantity, thickness, or percentage contribution in total snow depth in the study period. HLs with strong crystal bonds create a “framework” in the snowpack, which reduces compaction and, consequently, the ice formation layers slow down the rate of snowpack metamorphosis. The extrapolation of snow pit data through radar profiling is a novel solution that can improve spatial recognition of snow cover characteristics and the accuracy of calculation of snow water equivalent (SWE)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092eb878c28a04739f39a","602cd3a09543c7410626e3fa","5e709440878c28a0473b8dfc","5e7093a8878c28a0473ae842"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"189","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602cd3a09543c7410626e3fa","5e7092eb878c28a04739f39a","5e7093a8878c28a0473ae842","5e709440878c28a0473b8dfc","5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","issn":"2072-4292","eissn":"2072-4292","websiteLink":"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing","documentHash":"70fe2a0d-444c-49ea-9c4d-4dcd904ee147"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bbfb6240970754861e9aaf","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"1a1f29b5-db6e-4727-a3a2-9824ee31fa5f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["glaciology; snow cover; ground-penetrating radar (GPR); Svalbard; Arctic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058418317"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63b5687e4097076e4797eeb8","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Wojnar","documentHash":"274dc328-0c95-4f01-ab70-5a3dbf2aa600"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9291","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Bielski","uuid":"771E0E14DD2C4D4E909E95B8085E5009C99C91074655DB43545D59122AE02CCA203F4F9C9B4B38E878B106A93B0E26AA98B9AFAF8C48AEA23B454020569F725D","orcidId":"0000-0003-1708-3546","documentHash":"67993ab8-ca64-44e7-a770-257f6e329a39"}],"objectId":"63b5687e4097076e4797eeb6","doi":"10.15632/jtam-pl/151947","publicUri":"http://jtam.pl/pdf-151947-77078","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Laminar flow past the bottom with obstacles - a porous medium approximation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We provide a model of a stationary laminar flow in a channel at the bottom of which plants grow in a dense layer.

The total of elven solutions were tested. For each experimental set, a sequence of images with a falling particle was captured using a camera with macro lenses. Dataset includes position of particle in time and enables the evaluation of settling velocity. Rheological measurements were carried out for each test solution to assess flow properties and viscoelasticity. The following measurements were performed: shear dependent viscosity, shear stress amplitude sweeps, frequency sweeps, the dependence of the first normal stresses difference on shear strain at constant frequency (1 Hz). Datasets may be useful in various areas on fluid mechanics and rheology, e.g., in research on the impact of salinity on rheological properties of exopolymer solutions, to develop numerical models on solid particles settling in non-Newtonian fluids, and in studies on the impact of exopolymers and electrolytes dissolved in water on settling dynamics of solid particles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942c878c28a0473b78fc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"46","pagesFromTo":"1-8","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942c878c28a0473b78fc","5e709327878c28a0473a3c39"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dad9","mniswId":"21943","title":"Data in Brief","issn":"2352-3409","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"d03ee26a-9ff3-420a-8e24-1068922d8607"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["rheology","particle settling","xanthan gum","sedimentation","non-newtonian fluid","salinity","exopolymer"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058428560"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bfdfbf40970702a6671269","name":"Dessalegn Geleta","lastName":"Ebsa","documentHash":"ed08e088-973e-4a9d-89c5-bdbbf66eb31b"},{"objectId":"63bfdfbf40970702a6671268","name":"Megersa Kebede","lastName":"Leta","documentHash":"fa766a6a-7230-449a-b011-f054e264a91c"},{"objectId":"60c337969543c72336544149","name":"Motuma ","lastName":" Regasa","uuid":"16D39B99405C260E5EE724B2712D8075C7EF73E21F92FB58256AB5B7E13D4FEBACC5DBA375FAED178428D73468842760BB9D79D3E7932142CBE5541DAFE01D9B","documentHash":"aa31f51a-8437-4915-bd61-c84c21c017ea"}],"objectId":"63bfdfbf40970702a6671266","doi":"10.1155/2022/1826942","publicUri":"http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/aess/2022/1826942.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Parameter Uncertainty Analysis for Streamflow Simulation Using SWAT Model in Nashe Watershed, Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c337969543c72336544149"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2022","issue":"1826942","pagesFromTo":"1-19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bfdfbf40970702a6671268","63bfdfbf40970702a6671269","60c337969543c72336544149"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d795","mniswId":"20974","title":"Applied and Environmental Soil Science","issn":"1687-7667","eissn":"1687-7675","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"34e38cf6-5cd0-49b9-a031-ba34753cca1a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bfdfbf40970702a6671267","year":"2022","volume":"2022","documentHash":"50f0cc7c-4536-4657-a009-564ff9a941c8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058428767"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63becc604097072058757df2","name":"Megersa Kebede","lastName":"Leta","documentHash":"f0f4d0eb-0d20-42f6-82f2-00c8e420982f"},{"objectId":"63becc604097072058757df1","name":"Dereje","lastName":"Adeba","documentHash":"952ac189-b8fa-42bc-9ced-ae8548ffe801"},{"objectId":"63becc604097072058757df0","name":"Damtew Degefe","lastName":"Merga","documentHash":"362c97c9-79ca-4da1-a8cf-eecb1e0d3ea4"},{"objectId":"60c337969543c72336544149","name":"Motuma ","lastName":" Regasa","uuid":"16D39B99405C260E5EE724B2712D8075C7EF73E21F92FB58256AB5B7E13D4FEBACC5DBA375FAED178428D73468842760BB9D79D3E7932142CBE5541DAFE01D9B","documentHash":"aa31f51a-8437-4915-bd61-c84c21c017ea"}],"objectId":"63becc604097072058757def","doi":"10.3390/atmos13081296","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/13/8/1296/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Evaluation of Surface Water Resource Availability under the Impact of Climate Change in the Dhidhessa Sub-Basin, Ethiopia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Climate change, with its reaching implications, has become a popular topic in recent years. Among the many aspects of climate change, one of the most pressing concerns has been identified as the impact on the terrestrial water cycle, which has a direct impact on human settlement and ecosystems. The paper begins by reviewing previous studies, and then identifies their flaws and future research directions. The effects of climate change on surface water resources in the Dhidhessa Sub-basin, Abbay Basin, Ethiopia, were studied as practices. For future potential climate change, the results of global climate models (GCMs) and high-resolution regional climate models (RCMs) from multiple climate models were combined with data from Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change from the CCAFS Data Distribution Center web page. To evaluate the impacts on water resources, various distributed hydrologic models based on local underlying surfaces were developed. The future potential climate change of the Dhidhessa Sub-basin Province was evaluated by integrating RCP outputs, whereas the climate change of the Dhidhessa River was directly derived from the results of different RCP. Dhidhessa stream flow will decrease in the future compared to the baseline era. The predictions of future discharge (stream flow) were based on climate scenarios data from 1991 to 2020 and for the future with two time windows, 2044 (2030–2059) and 2084 (2070–2099), on a monthly time-step after bias correction to both precipitation and temperature in the future climate described in the under each RCP. According to model results, the quantity of surface water resources in the Dhidhessa river region will decrease over the next 100 years, the percent decrease in mean annual stream flow by 10%, in 2044, and 6.3% in 2084, respectively, making the impact of temperature increase on runoff greater than that of precipitation. The distribution of runoff would be more even across years but more uneven across years in the long-term window, implying a higher possibility of drought and flooding. In general, this study discovered that any effect on this river that results in a decrease in flow will have a direct impact on the area’s ongoing water resource development and socioeconomic development."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c337969543c72336544149"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1296","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63becc604097072058757df0","63becc604097072058757df1","60c337969543c72336544149","63becc604097072058757df2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724b","mniswId":"2021","title":"Atmosphere","issn":"2073-4433","eissn":"2073-4433","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e99bbe2c-fe08-4cb7-999f-c3a55335bedc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6339abef4097072262495ef8","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"8","documentHash":"aa059299-650c-42dd-bb38-1378bdb2904f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Dhidhessa; sub-basin; RCP; SWAT; climate; water; scenario"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058434623"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bed0f1409707205875df77","name":"Vu Anh","lastName":"Tuan","documentHash":"5abae8af-e60c-4260-8935-82042f5f87d6"},{"objectId":"63bed0f1409707205875df76","name":"Nguyen Duc","lastName":"Viet","documentHash":"3cd8b554-07ce-46fa-a7df-eea779623bd0"},{"objectId":"63bed0f1409707205875df75","name":"Janet","lastName":"Anstee","documentHash":"9f73ecda-d715-424f-a9d0-d9547102fa8b"},{"objectId":"63bed0f1409707205875df74","name":"Matt","lastName":"Paget","documentHash":"285eda00-a918-4015-bc25-ab3c4cdabcb3"},{"objectId":"63bed0f1409707205875df73","name":"Minh Nguyen","lastName":"Nguyen","documentHash":"9454a93b-b391-4be0-ae57-126f5c3653e7"},{"objectId":"63bed0f1409707205875df72","name":"Nguyen Hong","lastName":"Quang","documentHash":"3fa65821-e7ed-449f-923d-10ea05b22cf0"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","name":"MICHAEL","lastName":"NONES","uuid":"B4914AC97C650667BF5D9E583192DB532C1DA42B4B9204018194B0AA7AAE1F0EDC0539AC33BF1D2055B6771BBA95B52EDA2B3B3AD73872A38326ED211B1651C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4395-2637","documentHash":"e931d442-a9f1-4ea6-a34d-11a380da3c3b"}],"objectId":"63bed0f1409707205875df71","doi":"10.3390/rs14194822","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/19/4822/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Assessment of Human-Induced Effects on Sea/Brackish Water Chlorophyll-a Concentration in Ha Long Bay of Vietnam with Google Earth Engine","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Chlorophyll-a is one of the most important water quality parameters that can be observed by satellite imagery. It plays a significant function in the aquatic environments of rapidly developing coastal cities such as Ha Long City, Vietnam. Urban population growth, coal mining, and tourist activities have affected the water quality of Ha Long Bay. This work uses Sentinel-2/Multispectral Instrument (MSI) imagery data to a calibrated ocean chlorophyll 2-band (OC-2) model to retrieve chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in the bay from 2019 to 2021. The variability of chlorophyll-a during seasons over the study area was inter-compared. The chlorophyll-a concentration was mapped by analyzing the time series of water cover on the Google Earth Engine platform. The results show that the OC-2 model was calibrated well to the conditions of the study areas. The calibrated model accuracy increased nearly double compared with the uncalibrated OC-2 model. The seasonal assessment of chl-a concentration showed that the phytoplankton (algae) developed well in cold weather during fall and winter. Spatially, algae grew densely inside and in the surroundings of aquaculture, urban, and tourist zones. In contrast, coal mining activities did not result in algae development. We recommend using the Sentinel-2 data for seawater quality monitoring and assessment. Future work might focus on model calibration with a longer time simulation and more in situ measured data. Moreover, manual atmospheric correction of optical remote sensing is crucial for coastal environmental studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"4822","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bed0f1409707205875df72","63bed0f1409707205875df73","63bed0f1409707205875df74","63bed0f1409707205875df75","63bed0f1409707205875df76","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","63bed0f1409707205875df77"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","issn":"2072-4292","eissn":"2072-4292","websiteLink":"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing","documentHash":"70fe2a0d-444c-49ea-9c4d-4dcd904ee147"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"637617e040970765d46a7170","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"19","documentHash":"62235a59-6b8a-485c-86ca-1b91928df22d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["anthropogenic impacts; chlorophyll-a; Ha Long Bay; optical remote sensing; seawater; water quality"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058434756"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c5320f4097074bb0bbf3ab","name":"D.V.","lastName":"Hlavatskyi","documentHash":"08fa85f8-2d9e-4dfd-993c-84df3757121f"},{"objectId":"63c5320f4097074bb0bbf3aa","name":"V.V.","lastName":"Shcherbakova","documentHash":"8e272567-1aac-4bda-8da0-91f2fcf7f97f"},{"objectId":"63c5320f4097074bb0bbf3a9","name":"S.I.","lastName":"Cherkes","documentHash":"e7d949d2-da25-4b70-871c-96121184eec4"},{"objectId":"63c5320f4097074bb0bbf3a8","name":"I.B.","lastName":"Poliachenko","documentHash":"09e4fb93-b167-49e3-9635-7eaa15db55c4"},{"objectId":"627dc2a975234056eb6afbc7","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Bakhmutov","uuid":"7059FD3AE9096C82FAA942B8AF10C90EE2792230DC7C6461E41A0CFFDDA266C75F06F8C0B319E5D5CA564C79CAB7D68202774C7E149D0871580D98687BCCFD05","documentHash":"c1071bf8-bbc7-40bb-b846-f91c57011563"}],"objectId":"63c5320f4097074bb0bbf3a6","doi":"10.24028/gzh.v43i6.251555","publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/geofizicheskiy/article/download/251555/249854","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Palаeomagnetism of the Vendian traps of Volyn, southwestern margin of the East European platform. P. 1: palаeomagnetic directions and poles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In Earth’s geological evolution the Vendian is significant because: 1) it preceded the «Cambrian Evolutionary explosion» when the multicellular organisms became suddenly much more diverse; 2) it is associated with the global tectonic and palaeogeographic restructuring of supercontinents, a change in geomagnetic field generation and other global processes affecting different layers of the Earth. At the same time, recent publications indicate an extremely irregular behavior of the geomagnetic field in the Vendian, which significantly differs from the recent regime of the geomagnetic field generation. New information on the configuration and magnitude of the geomagnetic field is crucial for understanding the reasons that can cause different modes of geodynamo. The article describes the new results of palaeomagnetic studies of the Volyn traps — basalts and tuffs of the Volyn series with ages about 560—580 My. The determined palaeodirections and palaeopoles are in good agreement with the previously published data of other authors and substantially complement them. The ChRM-component of «low-titanium» basalts was isolated in high-temperature (>500 °C) and characterized as primary. The same samples were used for palaeointensity determinations which showed the extremely low values of the geomagnetic field — an order of magnitude lower than the present one. The ChRM-component of «high-titanium» basalts was yielded in the temperature range of 200—400 °C. No results were obtained from palaeointensity experiments, and the complex nature of remanent magnetization remains unclear. The new data are compared with the palaeo-magnetic data of the Vendian—Early Cambrian poles of the East European Platform determined by other authors. To test the hypothesis of an anomalous Ediacaran magnetic field characterized by a low dipole moment and a high inversion frequency, more data are necessary. These data can be obtained from the studies of a stratigraphically more complete section of the Volyn traps opened by boreholes. These results will be presented in the next part of the article."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

Interesting is that, that the decline in number of ice phenomena is generally faster in the mountain catchments rather than in the lowland parts of rivers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af53a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"45","pagesFromTo":"19-31","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af53a","5e70937a878c28a0473aa95e","5e709259878c28a0473941e7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e720c12467f01e9303df04","title":"Monografie Komitetu Gospodarki Wodnej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","issn":"0867-7816","documentHash":"63ba70f7-5b04-4233-9b14-3fe454aaa54e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bfe2f640970702a667ac5c","year":"2022","number":"45","documentHash":"bb867e9c-a534-4d11-9450-fbd1ff0a7a37"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ice phenomena, global warming, Poland, river, trends"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058439056"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c7b9a94097076eb3764634","name":"Qiangqing","lastName":"Xiong","documentHash":"62112e56-61d4-4ae3-8a62-6d6de56c8bde"},{"objectId":"63c7b9a94097076eb3764633","name":"Qingsong","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"1affc206-6415-4b43-b9ba-8c0e571d9805"},{"objectId":"63c7b9a94097076eb3764632","name":"Chuanjian","lastName":"Xu","documentHash":"85efbbdd-0201-42bc-963f-acbea8728fe3"},{"objectId":"63c7b9a94097076eb3764631","name":"Yuyang","lastName":"Tan","documentHash":"2a50a312-1eae-453a-8577-27a6128380f9"},{"objectId":"63c7b9a94097076eb3764630","name":"Haijiang","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"f1fcfe2f-cdf5-4e41-bfae-8afa0f0e25a6"},{"objectId":"63c7b9a94097076eb376462f","name":"Kangdong","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"3c9c2eb5-b130-4754-8337-07b060b210b0"},{"objectId":"63c7b9a94097076eb376462e","name":"Jiawei","lastName":"Qian","documentHash":"1e03c24d-1471-444f-ab48-18c2b8c0eca2"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","name":"Michał","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":"E022BA94789D74D23E41FED253EBD1E58BB96F3392CDEC6D0E204CD5AD5BB297E9ACB8770CC1CF4EBC30E32E3D816EE170453CA93CA7EA60A329F728C6E29B7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7190-3683","documentHash":"350c51a6-178b-45f0-ba79-d8fde881460e"}],"objectId":"63c7b9a94097076eb376462d","doi":"10.3389/feart.2022.952314","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.952314/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"First observation of paired microseismic signals during solution salt mining","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"To monitor the status of cavern roof instability induced by solution salt mining, we deployed a surface microseismic monitoring system for Dongxing salt mine, Dingyuan county, China. The microseismic monitoring system consists of 11 three-component geophones installed in shallow holes of 5 m deep. From 7-month continuous monitoring data, we have detected a novel type of signal that consists of two events. The first event has a long duration (>15 s) and generally has higher frequencies at the beginning. The 2nd event has a shorter duration of ∼3 s with lower frequencies. The two events are separated by ∼30–90 s in time. From May 2017 to November 2017, there are a total of 88 distinct paired signals with two events in sequence. We propose the first event corresponds to a series of fracturing processes on the cavern roof, and microseismic signals associated with different fractures are mixed and overlapped to produce a mixed signal with a longer duration. Due to a series of fracturing processes, some zones of cavern roof become instable and some rock debris may fall from the roof and collide on the cavern floor. This collision can produce a short duration signal, which corresponds to the 2nd event of the paired signal. The further analysis of polarities of the first arrivals for the 2nd event further proves its collision origin. The time interval between two events is related to the time for the falling rock debris through the brine, which is controlled by the cavern height and various physical properties of the rock debris and brine. Through the detailed analysis of paired signals, we can have a better understanding of the cavity development status for solution salt mining."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

earthquake swarm driven by magmatic intrusion at the Bransfield Strait, Antarctica","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"An earthquake swarm affected the Bransfield Strait, Antarctica, a unique rift basin in transition from intra-arc rifting to ocean spreading. The swarm, counting ~85,000 volcano-tectonic earthquakes since August 2020, is located close to the Orca submarine volcano, previously considered inactive. Simultaneously, geodetic data reported up to ~11 cm northwestward displacement over King George Island. We use a broad variety of geophysical data and methods to reveal the complex migration of seismicity, accompanying the intrusion of 0.26–0.56 km3 of magma. Strike-slip earthquakes mark the intrusion at depth, while shallower normal faulting the ~20 km long lateral growth of a dike.

Anthropogenic seismicity, i.e. the undesired dynamic rock mass response to geo-resources exploitation, is one of the examples of unwanted by-products of the technological operation of humans. The socio-economic impact of the induced seismicity is very significant. Induced earthquakes can cause material loss, injuries and even fatalities. Restricted access to data constitutes a barrier to assessing and mitigating the associated hazards. To respond to the need of the scientific community the Thematic Core Service Anthropogenic Hazards (TCS AH) has been created within the framework of the European Plate Observing System, a solid earth science European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC). TCS AH is an open consortium of 13 European institutions. TCS AH provides access to a novel e-research infrastructure, the EPISODES Platform (former name: IS-EPOS platform) to foster both research and training on induced seismicity and geo-hazards related to the exploration and exploitation of geo-resources. The EPISODES Platform is connected to international data nodes which offer open access to multidisciplinary datasets, called episodes. Episodes comprise geoscientific and associated data from industrial activity along with a large set of embedded applications for their efficient data processing, analysis and visualization. The EPISODES Platform opens also the possibility to create new applications and combine implemented applications with the user's codes. The team-working features of the EPISODES Platform facilitate collaborative and interdisciplinary scientific research, public understanding of science, citizen science applications, knowledge dissemination, and the teaching of anthropogenic hazards related to geo-resource exploitation. This study presents the current results of the TCS AH research infrastructure integration and also indicates the benefits of their usage for science, education, and innovation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af539","63c907d04097074220c4a79b","5e709350878c28a0473a70c2","5e70940d878c28a0473b5881"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"65","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"DM321","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940d878c28a0473b5881","5e7093b2878c28a0473af539","63c907d04097074220c4a79a","5e709350878c28a0473a70c2","63c907d04097074220c4a79b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477075","mniswId":"1242","title":"ANNALS OF GEOPHYSICS","issn":"1593-5213","eissn":"2037-416X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"b1900066-85fa-4673-af9e-0bc84f0f1541"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c907d04097074220c4a799","year":"2022","volume":"65","number":"3","documentHash":"e0727573-2c96-4ae0-bc7f-d0fa9970bd1f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058445473"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8c06","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Pawlak","uuid":"52A851BAFE768DACFB51B94A6A5D33913DB65E702B642A8B4696ED838CB7FEF65EBE78B80CE57AF35A2C33E3FB8C3100D1CD39F465B717F5ED919E628883E8AF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0004-5562","documentHash":"b7af63c9-935d-4b60-85c5-1fc023380680"},{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b5566","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Jarosławski","uuid":"1994FAC2A4D13850D47220B689D5EF020A61ED95FAD434BA5EB972DE29008C5218E6423578B289E0B7AA87491D68790DE07FC318B0E61B194F6FE43027DA18A6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4840-164X","documentHash":"1ec54648-c021-4c6a-8500-eafa7d0c5eb0"},{"objectId":"5e709390878c28a0473acfa4","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Guzikowski","uuid":"D3E7A310E39D4E52E5EB28381BBD844ACD45E776EC529DF85CB6C93944559C49119AE77E370C89DF2859C255E583E7D57FF2ACD5D7A7373BD9742C3C9885167D","orcidId":"0000-0001-9425-1991","documentHash":"4884c23c-5b68-404e-9ad3-5d1c15ad63f0"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7c28","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Pietruczuk","uuid":"3DBB552BC61CDBB0CA395E812239D596269AF17548EA28265F75D887C65C0BE5DB10A3A2FA3543538617BA27900579EB35AF63A2699FA59BD3F0C2859526D8B2","orcidId":"0000-0001-7058-3879","documentHash":"fb35a789-7b87-4818-9f1a-3d71ef7065c8"}],"objectId":"63c55fac4097074bb0c07bf9","doi":"10.3390/atmos13081228","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/13/8/1228/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Impact of Shale Gas Exploration and Exploitation Activities on the Quality of Ambient Air—The Case Study of Wysin, Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The continuous two-year monitoring of a set of air pollutants, as well as gases directly related to shale gas exploration processes (methane, non-methane hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide), was carried out at Stary Wiec village in the vicinity (1100 m) of the shale gas wells area in Wysin (Pomeranian voivodeship, north of Poland), covering the stages of preparation, drilling, hydrofracturing and closing of wells. The results of analysis of air pollution data from Stary Wiec and nearby urban and rural stations, over the period 2012–2017 (starting three years before preparations for hydraulic fracturing) indicated that Stary Wiec represents a clean rural environment with an average concentration of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and particulate matter that is one of the lowest in the Pomeranian region. The aim of this study was to explore the range of potential impact of shale gas exploration on local ambient air quality. Analysis of dependence of the concentration level of pollutants on the wind direction indicated that during the drilling period, when the air was coming directly from the area of the wells, nitrogen oxide concentration increased by 13%. Increases of concentration during the hydro-fracturing period, recorded at the Stary Wiec station, were equal to 108%, 21%, 18%, 12%, 7%, 4%, 1% for nitrogen oxide, non-methane hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, carbon dioxide and methane. The results of one-minute concentration values for the period 1–4 September 2016 showed a series of short peaks up to 7.45 ppm for methane and up to 3.03 ppm for non-methane hydrocarbons, being probably the result of operations carried out at the area of the wells."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8c06","5e709359878c28a0473a7c28","5e709390878c28a0473acfa4","5e70940b878c28a0473b5566"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1228","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940b878c28a0473b5566","5e70943f878c28a0473b8c06","5e709390878c28a0473acfa4","5e709359878c28a0473a7c28"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724b","mniswId":"2021","title":"Atmosphere","issn":"2073-4433","eissn":"2073-4433","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e99bbe2c-fe08-4cb7-999f-c3a55335bedc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6339abef4097072262495ef8","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"8","documentHash":"aa059299-650c-42dd-bb38-1378bdb2904f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["air pollution; shale gas; atmospheric methane; atmospheric nonmethane hydrocarbons"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058445838"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c558bf4097074bb0bfd405","name":"Moritz F.","lastName":"Lehmann","documentHash":"5623b994-da50-42b2-a67d-38dc636faa32"},{"objectId":"63c558bf4097074bb0bfd404","name":"Jakob","lastName":"Zopfi","documentHash":"81eddf83-f4b3-4f94-867e-49ad6b92962f"},{"objectId":"63c558bf4097074bb0bfd403","name":"Damien","lastName":"Bouffard","documentHash":"49dde6e5-c28f-4df8-9711-b2e7eedb7eac"},{"objectId":"63c558bf4097074bb0bfd402","name":"Oscar","lastName":"Sepúlveda Steiner","documentHash":"b21f122a-a7f9-4f05-b357-697dd57bb346"},{"objectId":"63c558bf4097074bb0bfd401","name":"Saskia","lastName":"Läubli","documentHash":"1f0b36d9-0685-42f5-8a93-c4bf7c8031a0"},{"objectId":"63c558bf4097074bb0bfd400","name":"Jessica","lastName":"Venetz","documentHash":"4c98d232-fabf-4e3f-8d3b-cda80d9742c0"},{"objectId":"60de971e9543c72336544649","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Bartosiewicz","uuid":"6038882D53BF8705F7CC73DC0B96D4E94A813F14440B999810EE9A26FF707CA592D37BB5E44D8F3AA399B31C5B3C54C0151658B91A9647C5AD96000BECBE9DD8","documentHash":"1e8cf486-5b86-4b01-8673-5c324044e85f"}],"objectId":"63c558bf4097074bb0bfd3fe","doi":"10.1002/lno.12263","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/lno.12263","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Detritus‐hosted methanogenesis sustains the methane paradox in an alpine lake","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Accumulation of methane in oxic waters of lakes and the ocean has been widely reported. Despite the importance for the greenhouse gas budget, mechanistic controls of such “methane paradox” remain elusive. Here, we use a combination of CH4 concentration and isotopic (δ13CCH4, δDH2O and δ18OH2O) measurements, plankton incubations and microbial community assessments to demonstrate the existence of the methane paradox in oxygenated waters of a meromictic lake (Lake Cadagno, Switzerland). Following mass dynamics using water isotopes, we exclude the possibility that the accumulation of CH4 at the thermocline results solely from lateral transport. Interannual variability in the magnitude of the methane paradox (between 0.5 and 5 μmol L−1) is associated to stratification patterns, changes in zooplankton biomass and planktonic detritus accumulation along density gradients, as well as fluctuating microbial cell numbers. The links between hydrodynamic conditions, aggregation of planktonic detritus and its microbiome, as well as the accumulation of CH4 in the water column are further supported by high-resolution echo-sounder measurements revealing backscatter maxima at the top of the thermocline, where detritus is effectively trapped, and by oxic incubations showing that CH4 is produced in zooplankton detritus (0.046 nmol L−1 to 0.095 CH4 mg dry mass L−1 d−1). Our results also show that detritus-hosted methanogenesis is stimulated through the addition of methylphosphonate, suggesting that zooplankton-associated microbiomes exploit organic phosphorus compounds to release CH4. Understanding the variability of the methane paradox in relation to changing hydrodynamics and plankton communities will be crucial to predict the future role of lakes in the global methane budget."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60de971e9543c72336544649"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"248-264","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60de971e9543c72336544649","63c558bf4097074bb0bfd400","63c558bf4097074bb0bfd401","63c558bf4097074bb0bfd402","63c558bf4097074bb0bfd403","63c558bf4097074bb0bfd404","63c558bf4097074bb0bfd405"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478cf6","mniswId":"13650","title":"LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY","issn":"0024-3590","documentHash":"c17962d9-0f64-4611-8165-2a6856d816c5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c558bf4097074bb0bfd3ff","year":"2023","volume":"68","number":"1","documentHash":"37427e8f-5960-4bcb-a2e9-457fbe86c079"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058446000"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c7b7194097076eb375fc4c","name":"Emma","lastName":"Bäckström","documentHash":"214a6699-ee48-417c-a139-7386cae9b6d5"},{"objectId":"63c7b7194097076eb375fc4b","name":"Paul","lastName":"Marsden","documentHash":"f18d7522-975e-4fed-8148-96606a8c2a4f"},{"objectId":"63c7b7194097076eb375fc4a","name":"Lukasz","lastName":"Sito","documentHash":"73e9ab50-6f85-45e4-9408-0cf46e5fe421"},{"objectId":"63c7b7194097076eb375fc49","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Markovic","documentHash":"ff4e3192-45ca-444e-b0b8-2167e93e8f03"},{"objectId":"63c7b7194097076eb375fc48","name":"Alireza","lastName":"Malehmir","documentHash":"b0d83463-d199-4c1d-a99f-74c8a600b92e"},{"objectId":"63c7b7194097076eb375fc47","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Buske","documentHash":"cff36bec-ed88-458a-95fe-9fcddd906a44"},{"objectId":"63c7b7194097076eb375fc46","name":"Lena","lastName":"Bräunig","documentHash":"fe2a579e-8626-41cc-a899-376f5828d32d"},{"objectId":"63c7b7194097076eb375fc45","name":"Felix","lastName":"Hloušek","documentHash":"1910e1df-c563-4516-aaa7-c0cb72fa0933"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","name":"Michał","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":"E022BA94789D74D23E41FED253EBD1E58BB96F3392CDEC6D0E204CD5AD5BB297E9ACB8770CC1CF4EBC30E32E3D816EE170453CA93CA7EA60A329F728C6E29B7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7190-3683","documentHash":"350c51a6-178b-45f0-ba79-d8fde881460e"}],"objectId":"63c7b7194097076eb375fc43","doi":"10.5194/se-13-917-2022","publicUri":"https://se.copernicus.org/articles/13/917/2022/se-13-917-2022.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Three-dimensional reflection seismic imaging of the iron oxide deposits in the Ludvika mining area, Sweden, using Fresnel volume migration","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present pre-stack depth-imaging results for a case study of 3D reflection seismic exploration at the Blötberget iron oxide mining site belonging to the Bergslagen mineral district in central Sweden. The goal of the study is to directly image the ore-bearing horizons and to delineate their possible depth extension below depths known from existing boreholes. For this purpose, we applied a tailored pre-processing workflow and two different seismic imaging approaches, Kirchhoff pre-stack depth migration (KPSDM) and Fresnel volume migration (FVM). Both imaging techniques deliver a well-resolved 3D image of the deposit and its host rock, where the FVM image yields a significantly better image quality compared to the KPSDM image. We were able to unravel distinct horizons, which are linked to known mineralization and provide insights on their possible lateral and depth extent. Comparison of the known mineralization with the final FVM reflection volume suggests a good agreement of the position and the shape of the imaged reflectors caused by the mineralization. Furthermore, the images show additional reflectors below the mineralization and reflectors with opposite dips. One of these reflectors is interpreted to be a fault intersecting the mineralization, which can be traced to the surface and linked to a fault trace in the geological map. The depth-imaging results can serve as the basis for further investigations, drilling, and follow-up mine planning at the Blötberget mining site."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"917-934","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c7b7194097076eb375fc45","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","63c7b7194097076eb375fc46","63c7b7194097076eb375fc47","63c7b7194097076eb375fc48","63c7b7194097076eb375fc49","63c7b7194097076eb375fc4a","63c7b7194097076eb375fc4b","63c7b7194097076eb375fc4c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454797b7","mniswId":"18696","title":"Solid Earth","issn":"1869-9510","eissn":"1869-9529","documentHash":"d8d372d4-6d6f-47af-a39b-a2fee2edd1a6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c7b7194097076eb375fc44","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"5","documentHash":"cc637353-f589-416f-ba84-fb7c83996fcd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058446135"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdd","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Czerwińska","uuid":"D9B7449C9FB28D64D4086462631A03FB2A3E2F0E328F40594AE4A5626B3B9A2D0D1C62129980E7CD3017A0BFAD04A2F6B2D32262D5D18C7E241BBDBFCF24A0A4","orcidId":"0000-0001-8583-5792","documentHash":"30e613a7-a6c2-4eb1-a467-a4eb17faba0d"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Krzyścin","uuid":"6AD82B7788E5B235D0100D0DD2F05BC12ADF71BABA36528B207E410E3E98418CE51603E68A8F27C444B4A2F3FA4B89F000E7F6CE90621B70778345877C60C011","orcidId":"0000-0002-3138-3951","documentHash":"81041a42-caf6-4771-9710-7828de8dacfb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6380b48040970744cbdc4349","doi":"10.1007/s00484-022-02337-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00484-022-02337-8.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Exposure to solar UV radiation of Polish teenagers after the first COVID-19 lockdown in March–April 2020","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In Poland, schools were closed from March to June 2020 due to the COVID-19 epidemic. During the lockdown (March–April), everyone was advised to stay at home. From May, students were allowed to spend time outdoors. We examine their exposure to solar UV radiation during the period of virtual learning at schools (May–June), vacations (July–August) and the first month of typical learning (September). Primary and high school students aged 12–18 completed a questionnaire on the details of their outdoor activities and the weather at the exposure site. A total of 146 anonymous questionnaires were registered for the study. The survey responses provided input to a radiative transfer model to estimate erythemal and vitamin D doses obtained by teenagers during outdoor activities. The results from 48% of the questionnaires indicated that students’ exposure exceeded 1 minimal erythema dose (MED) during the day. Corresponding doses of sun-synthesized vitamin D, in excess of 1000 international units (IU) and 2000 IU, were found in 77% and 66% of the surveys, respectively. Only 12% of the teenagers declared that they use sunscreen. The overexposure (> 1 MED) increased with age. It was found in 72% and 26% of surveys among the students aged 17–18 and 12–14, respectively. Teenagers seem to have tried to compensate for the lack of sunlight during the lockdown by engaging in outdoor activities permitted since May. While those activities could have improved their vitamin D levels, they also put them at a higher risk of developing erythema."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"2021-2032","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdd","5e709410878c28a0473b5a96"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547818e","mniswId":"8670","title":"International Journal of Biometeorology","issn":"0020-7128","eissn":"1432-1254","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"48020b96-d9a6-404d-98e0-ff922dfa6d5b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6380b48040970744cbdc434a","year":"2022","volume":"66","number":"10","documentHash":"b6ba5177-e15d-4d7f-a374-70f16c4e89a6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["UV radiation","erythema","vitamin D","Covid-19"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058456311"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4dc8","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Barański","uuid":"229248A7FD727C19A77C0FED00C891E7B7B2B308CBB83F03D87E8F81AD230AF10390374E480DEF09557BF1C0908C00FC9EF1918EF13CAF1F9CA855B91999AB84","orcidId":"0000-0003-2523-0024","documentHash":"6d049570-8da5-4eda-a72a-1fb6ad9d73cb"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d563","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Karnas","uuid":"B250F65B8F054C4DFAC47BD9F5B5C0793F758A33104371BEE638EE8ABE329DA14C8969F4C287C109EB6A4F22E04CC5F45A0E5F3161B0C3464CF39DBC92653F45","orcidId":"0000-0002-2255-5926","documentHash":"b234729a-06f4-4674-9ec8-394f4b0c03b6"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951d5","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Masłowski","uuid":"590E14BB3CD02582700EC444795B868566262CE559289B7F7FE31F518B8AD279346FDBA0319D36B52D807610894B0AB636D9EB2714A0E1A16762EB36C2A4F785","orcidId":"0000-0003-0028-1319","documentHash":"ad6c4c0f-0f2c-4c42-9312-f4ae4107b0a6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6384c4b84097073208733db7","doi":"10.3390/en15228566","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/22/8566","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A New Method for Modeling and Parameter Identification of Positively Charged Downward Lightning Leader Based on Remote Lightning Electric Field Signatures Recorded in the ELF/MF Range and 3D Doppler Radar Scanning Data","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this paper is modeling and parameter identification of the leader stage preceding the positive stroke of natural cloud-to-ground lightning.

The numerical simulation performed in the MATLAB platform showed that a high number of assumed model parameters, such as non-uniform leader tip speed and lightning channel charge density, allowed us to obtain greater compliance between simulated and measured electric field signatures than in the classical approach. The proposed model can be implemented in lightning location systems and forest fire warning systems, operating globally to reduce the risk of damages caused by positive cloud-to-ground flashes being one of the most dangerous type of lightning events. An alternative application of the model can be for research, including ground-based lightning data supplementation for the corresponding satellite and airborne registrations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In this research, we use the two-dimensional hydrodynamic model iRIC MFlow_02 to quantify the effects of BF on the lowermost section (ca. 1.5-km length) of a small (channel width ≤ 20 m) mountain stream, the Smolnik Stream, which flows into the Rożnów Dam Reservoir, in Southern Poland. To reproduce the hydrological conditions generally observed in the stream, six scenarios were simulated, considering three steady flow discharges at the inlet, with recurrence intervals of 1 year (1.8 m3 s−1, small flood), 2 years (24.5 m3 s−1; medium flood), and 20 years (89.5 m3 s−1; large flood), and two reservoir levels at the outlet: 265 m a.s.l. (normal reservoir water level) and 270 m a.s.l. (maximum reservoir water level). In these simulations, sediment transport and morphodynamics are not considered. The average modelled water depth was increased by backwater fluctuation in the channel, from 28% (from 1.62 m vs. 2.07 m) during a small flood, up to 59% (from 3.46 m to 5.50 m) during a large flood. Contrastingly, the average modelled flow velocity was decreased in the channel (from −8% 0.52 m s−1 vs. 0.47 m s−1) during a small flood to −78% (0.49 m s−1 vs. 0.11 m s−1) during a large flood. Our results demonstrate that backwater fluctuations substantially disturb the hydrodynamics of the studied stream, which is interpreted as a triggering factor of the previously documented alterations in its sedimentology, morphology, and riparian vegetation pattern."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","uid":"bqvFVl6-FYxc-KjUUrbTwDw","uuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","name":"Instytut Ochrony Przyrody Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092cb878c28a04739cbc6","5e709428878c28a0473b74fd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","parentUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","rootUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"3166","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092cb878c28a04739cbc6","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","5e709428878c28a0473b74fd","6393391c4097073c978a60dd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a9a","mniswId":"20224","title":"Water","issn":"2073-4441","eissn":"2073-4441","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"786ef469-6890-4f82-8160-9f545c27c509"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dam reservoir","backwater","iRIC","mountain river","Smolnik Strea"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058487836"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6561d21f40970749a8cd462f","name":"Kaisa","lastName":"Västilä","documentHash":"4d54ab89-88ad-4128-b99c-ff64cd60f3a4"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","name":"MICHAEL","lastName":"NONES","uuid":"B4914AC97C650667BF5D9E583192DB532C1DA42B4B9204018194B0AA7AAE1F0EDC0539AC33BF1D2055B6771BBA95B52EDA2B3B3AD73872A38326ED211B1651C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4395-2637","documentHash":"e931d442-a9f1-4ea6-a34d-11a380da3c3b"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba04c","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kalinowska","uuid":"890025F10DDB379DAD3AFB6288FA32C35FE12161DDACEB03B40B8B1DD1000CF2D4620D22104AC56D5A2CBE570EB2BDB1C6DD431ECA15E14674F688B3B4953853","orcidId":"0000-0002-6376-2235","documentHash":"d3f95bcd-203c-4cc7-af1e-4155e699fbd2"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdf","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Karamuz","uuid":"42510623665FE0F9C3E90EFFBE52337DCA2E7F6274643BDAB5CD13591E0EDB68962EF018F363C9A1A8E2C85E685741F5523AFC7B270A7EAEB97A679F3C4E5C7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-7226-7412","documentHash":"3bf44037-d31d-40de-9945-7be966f84232"},{"objectId":"5e7093be878c28a0473b0109","name":"Adam","lastName":"Kiczko","uuid":"1B7B7174A4560D6AB43533DCD580F339F21B7D7922543CD936068BF5644E3E94656B1BAB44861E303EA905232C2B2E40B80717AE325FE4A257291CCF6BB21640","orcidId":"0000-0003-0213-2413","documentHash":"ebde7c64-d419-44cb-b773-b049e2878b62"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a047394581","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Brandyk","uuid":"F4E7426C1E2D187739BA88DB4B27CAB5A719455FD0AD2A5C95414B9665D859F8375E3DB2546F93851BCC1AFD1918078AE9270D1650416F3AFC5951B7892944C7","orcidId":"0000-0002-6021-5340","documentHash":"a1c632f7-0165-48ee-b747-cd87707cd126"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a04739457c","name":"Adam","lastName":"Kozioł","uuid":"022D4A2875801685C5478A572C58EA790328F15D19FE3878F2D29B0323D2299E8C53F3B829CF318F19A0072F6494AF80AFF185CCA1EFC0AEA318A078E7D86C33","orcidId":"0000-0002-4059-8639","documentHash":"88958471-3ab5-4abf-abd4-a3123eb24cd3"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a047394578","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Krukowski","uuid":"BA9ECDABC1B86D98AEE1F99ED34EAC3C4A6AF411B652142C5E1072C50E2C9D09E49898DEBF01A2B8B298422A133221863FB5D6BDF82AAD862ADF07D0DA8A953A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4010-7916","documentHash":"32b67538-1f04-4f2d-90f6-f42eb328aac0"}],"objectId":"6422cbbb4097072924c67499","doi":"10.5194/hess-27-953-2023","publicUri":"https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/27/953/2023/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Influence of vegetation maintenance on flow and mixing: case  study comparing fully cut with high-coverage conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In temperate climates, agricultural ditches are generally bounded by seasonal vegetation, which affects the hydrodynamics and mixing processes within the channel and acts as a buffer strip to reduce a load of pollutants coming from the surrounding cultivated fields. However, even if the control of such vegetation represents a key strategy to support sediment and nutrient management, the studies that investigated the effect of different vegetation maintenance scenarios or vegetation coverage on the flow and mixing dynamics at the reach scale are very limited. To overcome these limitations and provide additional insights into the involved processes, tracer tests were conducted in an agricultural ditch roughly 500 m long close to Warsaw in Poland, focusing on two different vegetation scenarios: highly vegetated and fully cut. Under the highly vegetated scenario, sub-reaches differing in surficial vegetation coverage are analysed separately to better understand the influence of the vegetation conditions on the flow and mixing parameters. Special attention has been paid to the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in complex natural conditions and its dependency on vegetation coverage (V). The vegetation maintenance decreased the travel and residence times of the solute by 3–5 times, moderately increasing the peak concentrations. We found that the dispersion coefficient decreased approximately linearly with the increase of vegetation coverage at V&gt;68 %. Further research is needed at lower vegetation coverage values and different spatial plant distributions. The obtained longitudinal dispersion coefficient values complement dispersion value datasets previously published in the literature, which are barely available for small natural streams. The new process understanding supports the design of future investigations with more environmentally sound vegetation maintenance scenarios."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04c","5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"953-968","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba04c","6561d21f40970749a8cd462f","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","5e7093be878c28a0473b0109","5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdf","5e70925d878c28a047394581","5e70925d878c28a04739457c","5e70925d878c28a047394578"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f84","mniswId":"7818","title":"Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","issn":"1027-5606","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"0f5d0669-0f36-41af-9b21-74e51b56415b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6639fb654097077c1aa6680c","year":"2023","volume":"27","number":"7","doi":"","documentHash":"fe1dcdae-225f-4f8f-bea9-386e51ebaf9c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058553554"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b4621","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Rudziński","uuid":"961F1D1124C7A6EE5547DCF0BA71246B84C544674F664FFB9BCD28552206D586EA78801AAEE81E2CE810AE31B51A5D62634DE5956B6F789EEEEFB590163D028A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2748-4167","documentHash":"6c723c64-3a72-4e29-83d4-a0e99517c798"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac919","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Kokowski","uuid":"D7594DC2D9655749CB0669CAEE5315A8B84BFD1B0C7FC25829C6AB004D41CF560E289FE55209C3B2041F8C909F85BE1CD48F910D2B20D8104FBFD2FB1500C15D","documentHash":"e6e03a23-e6e5-401d-ba29-3307a5a74f4e"}],"objectId":"6422ea014097072924c8abf4","doi":"10.1093/gji/ggad102","publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/gji/ggad102/49483008/ggad102.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Estimation of location errors for local seismic network in an area with intense and weak seismicity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We have modified a method for estimation of location errors distribution for local seismic networks in area with intense shallow seismicity.

In consequence, the method enables the evaluation of the applied velocity models during the analysis of traveltime residuals, as well as evaluation of the usefulness of individual stations with the use of probability plots. Ultimately, it provides assessment of the station configuration by analysing the distribution of location errors. The data needed for the analysis are a seismic catalogue containing earthquakes locations together with traveltime residuals and the velocity model, as well as stations metadata.

Nonetheless, it remains challenging to document and decipher impacts on key ecosystem processes such as primary production and pelagic-benthic coupling, due to limited observations in this remote area. Here we investigated environmental changes at the Laptev Sea continental slope (60-3400 m water depth) from the surface to the seafloor, by replicating sample transects two decades apart. Mean break-up of sea ice occurred earlier and mean freeze-up occurred later in 2012 compared to 1993, extending the ice-free period by more than 30 days. On average, observations and model results showed an annual increase in primary production of 30% and more in the study area in 2012. In contrast, calculated and modelled fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC) to the seafloor were only slightly higher in 2012 and did not extend as far into the deep Laptev Sea as the increase in primary production, possibly due to a more developed retention system. Nevertheless, benthic surveys revealed a substantial increase in phytodetritus availability at the seafloor along the entire transect from the shelf edge to the deep sea. This calls for carbon input by lateral advection from the shelves, additional input from sea ice, and/or a late summer bloom. We also investigated the composition and activity of bacterial communities at the seafloor and potential linkages to the observed environmental changes. While bacterial abundance, biomass and overall community structure showed no systematic differences between the two contrasting years at all depths, extracellular enzymatic activities had increased as a result of higher food availability. This was partly reflected in higher benthic oxygen uptake, indicating a moderate impact on benthic remineralization rates at the time of sampling. Our results show considerable effects of ocean warming and sea ice loss on the ecosystem from the surface ocean to the seafloor in the Laptev Sea, which are likely to continue in the coming decades."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["625635a87523402df0a0ac64"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63b4402140970722144afe7f","63b4402140970722144afe80","63b4402140970722144afe81","63b4402140970722144afe82","63b4402140970722144afe83","625635a87523402df0a0ac64","63b4402140970722144afe84","63b4402140970722144afe85","63b4402140970722144afe86"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"620a523b2467f06a1edbdb2f","year":"2022","volume":"9","documentHash":"17b56cb2-5e8f-41ce-a89d-d4b387701e78"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058569664"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"641b034c40970710688176d7","name":"Adrian J.","lastName":"Matthews","documentHash":"0a1fc5af-6f2a-4146-a9a1-24702527b5c9"},{"objectId":"641b034c40970710688176d6","name":"Adam V.","lastName":"Rydbeck","documentHash":"8f1f6ee6-8755-4bad-b38d-8e54cf7a30fd"},{"objectId":"641b034c40970710688176d5","name":"Donaldi S.","lastName":"Permana","documentHash":"0456dc4a-1a9c-4347-b1f0-e7a9150a3bcb"},{"objectId":"641b034c40970710688176d4","name":"Nelly Florida","lastName":"Riama","documentHash":"ca759c31-b0b3-421c-a942-7345584f882c"},{"objectId":"641b034c40970710688176d3","name":"Piotr J.","lastName":"Flatau","documentHash":"23b55827-9a4f-4943-b44e-e5d4192a24c1"},{"objectId":"641b034c40970710688176d2","name":"Maria K.","lastName":"Flatau","documentHash":"ddbf1c8c-b7cd-4350-87f1-5cbdd7296b1b"},{"objectId":"641b034c40970710688176d1","name":"Thierry","lastName":"Lefort","documentHash":"59d512c3-e111-4797-8277-a2ce84501d26"},{"objectId":"641b034c40970710688176d0","name":"Philippe","lastName":"Peyrillé","documentHash":"a1078093-b302-421a-b1c1-52bdb1f76c67"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c991","name":"Beata","lastName":"Latos","documentHash":"89829304-a162-4d3f-82c7-d14b40d8dabf"},{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b9529","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Baranowski","uuid":"E9C0F08149937783694881B65F0AA91602914BB2ED1CBB3776AF6AC11C6388CA908F908B25B7B953FD6562C52E891D68CE36AE7CAB983C00E90D44DDF9355D29","orcidId":"0000-0001-8848-3884","documentHash":"5097c8d3-cdae-4419-95fc-49ba6a4289a9"}],"objectId":"641b034c40970710688176cf","doi":"10.1038/s41467-023-36498-w","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36498-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The role of tropical waves in the genesis of Tropical Cyclone Seroja in the Maritime Continent","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tropical cyclone Seroja was one of the first tropical cyclones to significantly impact Indonesian land, and the strongest one in such close proximity to Timor Island. In April 2021 Seroja brought historic flooding to near-equatorial regions of Indonesia and East Timor, as well as impacting Western Australia. Here we show that the unusual near-equatorial cyclogenesis in close proximity to a land mass was due to “perfect storm” conditions associated with multiple wave interactions. Specifically, this was associated with enhanced equatorial convection on the leading edge of a Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) event. Within the MJO, the interaction between a convectively coupled equatorial Rossby wave and two convectively coupled Kelvin waves span up the initial vortex and accelerated cyclogenesis. On average, such favorable atmospheric conditions can occur once per year. These results indicate the potential for increased predictability of tropical cyclones over the Maritime Continent."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c991","5e709445878c28a0473b9529"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c796a8752340480571c991","641b034c40970710688176d0","641b034c40970710688176d1","5e709445878c28a0473b9529","641b034c40970710688176d2","641b034c40970710688176d3","641b034c40970710688176d4","641b034c40970710688176d5","641b034c40970710688176d6","641b034c40970710688176d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f7e","mniswId":"14814","title":"Nature Communications","issn":"2041-1723","eissn":"2041-1723","documentHash":"8ac6042b-5d3a-47c7-90e7-2c25bff3698a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63fb7a924097070abf6baa05","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"1","documentHash":"fe865c37-e3db-4018-9d45-5ce1bd87e54e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058576319"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094e7878c28a0473c6935","name":"Agata","lastName":"Goździk","uuid":"774A4CDBCDF6EBB376800A3FBFCC930394AE977968AE754F2BCC37930CF797D04317353729CECA125ACF18ACADC7A96050BAE3F21D8E136DADE488F3094F707B","orcidId":"0000-0002-9474-9500","documentHash":"148c7398-8145-46be-a8fe-ff7c5c51f816"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba04c","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kalinowska","uuid":"890025F10DDB379DAD3AFB6288FA32C35FE12161DDACEB03B40B8B1DD1000CF2D4620D22104AC56D5A2CBE570EB2BDB1C6DD431ECA15E14674F688B3B4953853","orcidId":"0000-0002-6376-2235","documentHash":"d3f95bcd-203c-4cc7-af1e-4155e699fbd2"}],"objectId":"63bd6eff4097073596a38eb2","doi":"10.15199/2.2022.3.1","publicUri":"https://sigma-not.pl/publikacja-136695-2022-3.html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Badania rzek i kanałów z wykorzystaniem nauki obywatelskiej","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Roślinność ma kluczowe znaczenie w środowisku wodnym.

The salt-rich DehDasht structural basin, in the SW of Iran, is an example of this area, which is characterized by high seismicity. Despite the complex geology and the great thickness of evaporitic deposits in this region, surface wave tomography can retrieve high-resolution images by applying a dense network of stations. Therefore, >11,000 micro-earthquakes (M ≤ 3.0) recorded by 116 broadband stations in 9 months were processed to detect geological structures and a crustal model beneath the DehDasht region. After selecting strict data selection criteria, the observed dispersion curves of Rayleigh waves were then measured using the multiple filter analysis method, and the 2D tomography was done for periods of 0.3 to 5.0 s. A non-linear iterative damped least-squares inversion procedure was then applied to each local dispersion curve to obtain the 1D VS model of the uppermost 5 km, and the results were inserted into the original cells to construct a quasi-3D VS model. Although our resulted VS model has high correlations with known geological units and tectonic features of the study area, we validated it by inverting the observed gravity data independently and consequently recovering the location of the anomalies at the basin and/or around faults, anticlines, and synclines. Generally, the observed low-and high-velocity anomalies are associated with the sedimentary materials."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6100f59d9543c7220b70a8c3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"334","pagesFromTo":"106972","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bd710e4097073596a3beaf","63bd710e4097073596a3beb0","63bd710e4097073596a3beb1","63bd710e4097073596a3beb2","6100f59d9543c7220b70a8c3","63bd710e4097073596a3beb3","63bd710e4097073596a3beb4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479281","mniswId":"16121","title":"PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS","issn":"0031-9201","eissn":"1872-7395","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"ecfcba89-d89a-439c-b20e-86616752ac89"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bd710e4097073596a3beae","year":"2023","volume":"334","documentHash":"5032b1b8-f1c6-4851-9473-d521102e04d4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Rayleigh waveDispersion curvesTomographyDehDashtZagros"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058580134"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bed4a540970720587619eb","name":"Artur","lastName":"Radecki-Pawlik","documentHash":"3537d6d2-5161-4b3e-bef6-1e28d6e2162f"},{"objectId":"63bed4a540970720587619ea","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Okruszko","documentHash":"0fce348b-9284-4c41-b9af-5fcb2eba3f60"},{"objectId":"5e7093f7878c28a0473b414b","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Rowiński","uuid":"5C587EC2CBF79687D6F938643FA39B1E4A2C914ED909935685E8C108F09235025E0F24890BE3A2F7DF076746F57B4CE7CEAD003A60C8BDF9A708807C38E2CA3C","orcidId":"0000-0001-7774-8592","documentHash":"d2015c6b-752e-415b-a0f2-367b630ebbb5"}],"objectId":"63bed4a540970720587619e8","doi":"10.1016/j.ecohyd.2021.12.003","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1642359321001178?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Environmental hydraulics research for river health: recent advances and challenges","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Environmental hydraulics, a neighboring research field to ecohydrology, is an intermediate area between hydrodynamics and ecology/biology.

from natural sediments to tackle microplastics challenges: A multidisciplinary perspective","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Although the study of microplastics in the aquatic environment incorporates a diversity of research fields, it is still in its infancy in many aspects while comparable topics have been studied in other disciplines for decades. In particular, extensive research in sedimentology can provide valuable insights to guide future microplastics research. To advance our understanding of the comparability of natural sediments with microplastics, we take an interdisciplinary look at the existing literature describing particle properties, transport processes, sampling techniques and ecotoxicology. Based on our analysis, we define seven research goals that are essential to improve our understanding of microplastics and can be tackled by learning from natural sediment research, and identify relevant tasks to achieve each goal. These goals address (1) the description of microplastic particles, (2) the interaction of microplastics with environmental substances, (3) the vertical distribution of microplastics, (4) the erosion and deposition behaviour of microplastics, (5) the impact of biota on microplastic transport, (6) the sampling methods and (7) the microplastic toxicity. When describing microplastic particles, we should specifically draw from the knowledge of natural sediments, for example by using shape factors or applying methods for determining the principal dimensions of non-spherical particles. Sediment transport offers many fundamentals that are transferable to microplastic transport, and could be usefully applied. However, major knowledge gaps still exist in understanding the role of transport modes, the influence of biota on microplastic transport, and the importance and implementation of the dynamic behaviour of microplastics as a result of time-dependent changes in particle properties in numerical models. We give an overview of available sampling methods from sedimentology and discuss their suitability for microplastic sampling, which can be used for creating standardised guidelines for future application with microplastics. In order to comprehensively assess the ecotoxicology of microplastics, a distinction must be made between the effects of the polymers themselves, their physical form, the plastic-associated chemicals and the attached pollutants. This review highlights areas where we can rely on understanding and techniques from sediment research - and areas where we need new, microplastic-specific knowledge - and synthesize recommendations to guide future, interdisciplinary microplastic research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e43"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"228","pagesFromTo":"104021","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bfc8c740970702a6642926","63bfc8c740970702a6642927","63bfc8c740970702a6642928","63bfc8c740970702a6642929","63bfc8c740970702a664292a","63bfc8c740970702a664292b","63bfc8c740970702a664292c","63bfc8c740970702a664292d","63bfc8c740970702a664292e","63bfc8c740970702a664292f","63bfc8c740970702a6642930","63bfc8c740970702a6642931","63bfc8c740970702a6642932","63bfc8c740970702a6642933","63bfc8c740970702a6642934","63bfc8c740970702a6642935","63bfc8c740970702a6642936","63bfc8c740970702a6642937","63bfc8c740970702a6642938","63bfc8c740970702a6642939","63bfc8c740970702a664293a","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e43","63bfc8c740970702a664293b","63bfc8c740970702a664293c","63bfc8c740970702a664293d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779e2","mniswId":"5279","title":"EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS","issn":"0012-8252","documentHash":"12f28f4b-0a7c-4b61-8151-b4641dd4a10b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bfc8c740970702a6642925","year":"2022","volume":"228","documentHash":"2d434118-5d46-4226-9ae2-4bf08eb8c340"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sediment transportEcotoxicologyComparison Microparticles Fate DistributionTransport modelling Rivers Plastic pollution Aquatic pollution Sediment analogy Microplastics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058582859"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4db8","name":"Jan","lastName":"Wiszniowski","uuid":"AEA52C3ABBD181EF951F64E380EB7030C5137B70E7D297A700A611560C090BBC1E8841F333851F96FDB8F32827E54E7B4CF224F45D338393BA7F6EE1C2609640","orcidId":"0000-0001-7236-7002","documentHash":"7f416212-1e43-4f3d-872a-f40b46e4b772"}],"objectId":"63be6bbe40970720586cb539","doi":"10.1007/s00024-022-02975-4","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00024-022-02975-4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Application of Focal Plane Directions for Estimating Ground Motion Models with General Regression Neural Networks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The general regression neural network (GRNN) allows testing of various events, wave paths, and site features as ground motion model (GMM) predictors.

The f(X|y) is estimated by a kernel estimator. The GRNN was modified. Instead of the Euclidean distance of all predictors, we look for various metric spaces of predictors that minimize cross-validation error. This approach was used in the search for the GMM whose predictors include values describing focal mechanisms. Nodal plane angles were applied. GMMs containing different predictor configurations were compared. It was noticed that rake and strike nodal plane angles have an impact on the GRNN GMM while the dip angle does not.

Using the Ethiopian Fincha watershed as a case study, the present work focuses on (i) identifying historical LULC change in the period 1989–2019; (ii) estimating LULC in the next thirty years, combining Geographical Information Systems (GIS) with Land Change Modelling (LCM). Landsat 5/8 images were combined with field evidence to map LULC in three reference years (1989, 2004, 2019), while the Multi-Layer Markov Chain (MPL-MC) model of LCM was applied to forecast LULC in 2030, 2040, and 2050. The watershed was classified into six classes: waterbody, grass/swamp, built-up, agriculture; forest; and shrub. The results have shown that, in the past 30 years, the Fincha watershed experienced a reduction in forest and shrubs of about −40% and −13%, respectively, mainly due to ever-increasing agricultural activities, and such a trend is also expected in the future. In fact, for the period 2019–2050, LCM simulated a significant decrease in both forest and shrubs (around −70% and −20%, respectively), in favor of more areas covered by grass (19%) and built-up (20%). It is worth noting that a decrease in natural forests can drive an increase in soil erosion, fostering siltation in the water reservoirs located in the sub-basin. The study pointed out the urgency of taking actions in the sub-basin to counteract such changes, which can eventually lead to a less sustainable environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","60c337969543c72336544149"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1239","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c337969543c72336544149","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cb5e","mniswId":"13432","title":"Land","issn":"2073-445X","eissn":"2073-445X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"f99a0a51-0ae9-4af7-bbc6-fc2abc5289ff"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62fea81140970714d4e5d7d3","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"8","doi":"","documentHash":"b4b0de93-27b7-405a-9c9a-9420e8ff252b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ethiopia; Fincha river; land use land cover; land change modeler; multi-layer Markov chain"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058583069"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bfdd0540970702a6669102","name":"Aku","lastName":"Heinonen","documentHash":"789af12e-305a-4dd0-8593-5a9363b657e6"},{"objectId":"63bfdd0540970702a6669101","name":"Sakari","lastName":"Väkevä","documentHash":"0b003ff4-530a-49af-9ff8-b6d6f4228924"},{"objectId":"63bfdd0540970702a6669100","name":"Kari","lastName":"Komminaho","documentHash":"723a6e31-053e-4b7a-ba0c-04635eb5c7b9"},{"objectId":"63bfdd0540970702a66690ff","name":"Toni","lastName":"Veikkolainen","documentHash":"d4f01c62-da83-450b-bc11-73b9dacd84ed"},{"objectId":"63bfdd0540970702a66690fe","name":"Timo","lastName":"Tiira","documentHash":"34c801b6-7d24-4a1c-b23f-f68bb77cbcbc"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b875d","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Janik","uuid":"EE02BD7EB3B5C00771B1C3CFAB36AE04859683CFAFE1C88F73DF3A8938A90E701BA090D8456BDE22DC1520959498EE2F3AB06BD3F63662033AD1DAA20AC11428","orcidId":"0000-0002-5915-9740","documentHash":"4f253406-a100-4d3d-803b-e6715062f991"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac90b","name":"Tymon","lastName":"Skrzynik","uuid":"72B3E92E97C22B510DB8C6CD15E3754AC71A6789AE4D06346342C43249753ECD51FD3246BAB0FB022389B8D043AE024004CCA9BC300312721C94EF1F84C8933A","documentHash":"464f22c9-b817-4d2d-b735-69b9922dc0f1"}],"objectId":"63bfdd0540970702a66690fc","publicUri":"https://tuhat.helsinki.fi/ws/portalfiles/portal/247093693/tiira_et_al_bulletin_vol_94_part_2_2022_165_180.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Implications on crustal structure from the South Finland Coastal (SOFIC) deep seismic sounding profile","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present results from a deep seismic sounding (DSS) experiment carried out along\nthe southern coast of Finland in summer 2015.

The field work performed in 2021, included the deployment of autonomous seismic stations and drilling-explosive works. A total of 264 seismic receivers were deployed (160 DATA-CUBE and 104 TEXAN stations) with the average spacing between the observation points  about 2.65 km. The sampling interval for all stations was 0.01 s. Seismic energy was generated by 10 shot points with ~50 km of distance between them and total charge in all wells 5775 kg. The SHIELD’21 experiment using TEXAN and DATA-CUBE short-period seismic stations provided high-quality seismic records. The main recorded seismic waves are the refractions of P- and S-waves in sediments, basement, crust and upper-most mantle, and reflections from crustal boundaries, Moho interface and boundaries in the uppermost mantle. Correlation of travel time arrivals of seismic waves provides calculation of the velocity model for both P- and S-waves. The main objective of the SHIELD’21 project is to get new seismic data that increase our knowledge on the lithosphere structure as well as geodynamics of the oil-and-gas-bearing and ore regions of Ukraine."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b875d","5e709439878c28a0473b875e","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04a","6422ed044097072924c8c6a4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"45","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6422ed044097072924c8c69e","5e709439878c28a0473b875d","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04a","5e709439878c28a0473b875e","6422ed044097072924c8c69f","6422ed044097072924c8c6a0","6422ed044097072924c8c6a1","6422ed044097072924c8c6a2","6422ed044097072924c8c6a3","6422ed044097072924c8c6a4","6422ed044097072924c8c6a5","6422ed044097072924c8c6a6","6422ed044097072924c8c6a7","6422ed044097072924c8c6a8","6422ed044097072924c8c6a9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c203","mniswId":"7079","title":"Geofizicheskiy Zhurnal-Geophysical Journal","issn":"0203-3100","eissn":"2524-1052","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"73249c9b-fe0a-470c-a816-ebf120a5c138"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6422ed044097072924c8c69d","year":"2023","volume":"45","number":"1","documentHash":"0d501299-1c67-4578-b3dc-1dbc691680b0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["WARR studies, SHIELD’21 profile, Ukraine, Ukrainian Shield, crust, upper mantle"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589301"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6581831b4097076c14b77b2a","name":"David","lastName":"Parcerisa","documentHash":"d6c8800d-2a5c-4ac0-a59d-ef373d2aeda2"},{"objectId":"6581831b4097076c14b77b29","name":"Andrey","lastName":"Gurenko","documentHash":"eb323302-f5d9-4fef-94c9-0204727a757d"},{"objectId":"6581831b4097076c14b77b26","name":"Carles","lastName":"Fabrega","documentHash":"b906bb69-f364-4701-8b46-5b4df6b82127"},{"objectId":"6581831b4097076c14b77b25","name":"Kouakou F.

The standard description of turbulence involves determination of the spectral energy profile, in other words the so-called turbulent energy cascade. An important, unanswered question concerns the effect of instabilities on the features of fully developed turbulence, since instabilities lead to chaotic, nonlinear behaviour in the first place and the final structure of turbulence is not independent of its original source. However, hydrodynamic instabilities are strongly anisotropic and often inhomogeneous, therefore analytic results are not achievable. Here, to study this problem a simpler case of an active scalar transport is considered, that is the evolution of temperature through advection, diffusion and heat sources; the advecting flow is influenced and slaved by the temperature through buoyancy and assumption of rapid background rotation. Homogeneous instability is induced by the heat source. This allows to apply the renormalization group technique to extract the final simple recursion differential equations for the turbulent diffusivities from the fully nonlinear dynamical equation, which are solved numerically.

The GRASP Open aerosol retrieval algorithm is supplied with remote LIDAR and sunphotometer data to obtain aerosol extinction profiles within the LIDAR’s operation range for coarse and fine aerosol modes separately. These are supplemented with ground-based in-situ measurements of particle size distribution that are translated to coarse and fine aerosol extinction coefficients with the use of Mie theory. UAV-based observations with optical particle counters are included to add information on vertical aerosol variability in the near-surface region. The profiles are closed with an analytical interpolation that is fine-tuned to produce continuous and smooth extinction profiles throughout the whole troposphere that are in agreement with columnar aerosol optical depth measurements. We present the possibility of reconstructing a complete and calibrated aerosol extinction profile, based on the case studies at a Central European background station. We include data-denial experiments to show that the inclusion of UAV-based measurements improves such reconstructions by providing crucial information on aerosol profiles near the ground. The proposed methodology can prove to be a potent tool for studies of aerosol concentration and evolution, especially when the majority of the pollution resides near the surface.

Passive recordings containing seismic arrivals from subsurface sources could be seen as having a geometry resembling reverse vertical seismic profiling (RVSP). In such scenarios, the intersource seismic-interferometry technique can be used to redatum the surface receivers to the subsurface source positions resulting in virtual shot gathers at depth. The success of the interferometric processing primarily requires that a correlation panel created in the interferometric process contains stationary-phase regions that, when summed, retrieve events with correct timing, whereas nonstationary contributions are canceled. We have addressed the combination of the RVSP configuration and ambient-noise measurements. We develop a prototype of a data-driven technique allowing us to adapt the summation process such that changes in the stationary-phase requirements imposed by changes in the noise-sources distribution can be adaptively satisfied without the need for array redeployment. We propose to identify the receivers located in the stationary-phase regions by scanning for stationary contributions in the correlation panel prior to stacking. Our method uses the correlation coefficient and time windowing to distinguish between stationary and nonstationary arrivals. The improved Green's function estimate is obtained by limiting the summation to only those receivers that, when summed, enhance the stationary and attenuate the nonstationary contributions. We test this using a simple 2D numerical example to find a practical way to alleviate insufficient receiver coverage. We determine the theoretical possibility to improve the intersource Green's function estimates without explicit knowledge of the target and the source distribution. However, our data-driven approach has the disadvantage of being limited to scenarios in which the correlation panel from all receivers contains identifiable stationary-phase arrivals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"87","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"KS169-KS182","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c7c5c14097076eb377587c","63c7c5c14097076eb377587d","63c7c5c14097076eb377587e","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e1e","mniswId":"7141","title":"Geophysics","issn":"0016-8033","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"9b8aa276-85ca-4efc-a130-57b255d99a39"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c7c5c14097076eb377587b","year":"2022","volume":"87","number":"6","documentHash":"0fa70ef5-5bd2-4ca7-87c4-ed0fa6919030"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058595976"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c972","name":"Alnilam","lastName":"Fernandes","uuid":"AEFF83A493CDEA259DD6251E65F029F3B6C7C876B3EEF8C6ACB00284DF3F482FEF3E32D3AEC2926AEEABE459115780E9EDECDB0BE0B17D0861A0693C45D580FA","documentHash":"8c2180c0-b88e-4b58-8592-bfa946cdcfe9"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8c06","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Pawlak","uuid":"52A851BAFE768DACFB51B94A6A5D33913DB65E702B642A8B4696ED838CB7FEF65EBE78B80CE57AF35A2C33E3FB8C3100D1CD39F465B717F5ED919E628883E8AF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0004-5562","documentHash":"b7af63c9-935d-4b60-85c5-1fc023380680"},{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b5566","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Jarosławski","uuid":"1994FAC2A4D13850D47220B689D5EF020A61ED95FAD434BA5EB972DE29008C5218E6423578B289E0B7AA87491D68790DE07FC318B0E61B194F6FE43027DA18A6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4840-164X","documentHash":"1ec54648-c021-4c6a-8500-eafa7d0c5eb0"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7c28","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Pietruczuk","uuid":"3DBB552BC61CDBB0CA395E812239D596269AF17548EA28265F75D887C65C0BE5DB10A3A2FA3543538617BA27900579EB35AF63A2699FA59BD3F0C2859526D8B2","orcidId":"0000-0001-7058-3879","documentHash":"fb35a789-7b87-4818-9f1a-3d71ef7065c8"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a05c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Klejnowski","uuid":"B459E2FB805DEB77A9A28A1BD0150DC89F992223B02075CEB155FEFCD57418F8EDEEDE8BA42C4FC375993D0D19B770368FE111FDB43AC6D0A126BDE400E2B7A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-9237-5074","documentHash":"5e64518c-1526-4ff9-8c0c-d4afc2fa4bf7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"644bb29540970748461bd78a","doi":"10.3390/atmos14040670","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/14/4/670/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Comparison of 24 h Surface Ozone Forecast for Poland: CAMS Models vs Simple Statistical Models with Limited Number of Input Parameters","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Surface ozone is usually measured in national networks, including the monitoring of gaseous components important for determining air quality and the short-term forecast of surface ozone. Here we consider the option of forecasting surface ozone based on measurements of only surface ozone and several weather parameters. This low-cost configuration can increase the number of locations that provide short-term surface ozone forecast important to local communities. 24 h prediction of the 1-h averaged concentration of surface ozone were presented for rural (Belsk, 20.79° E, 51.84° N) and suburban site (Racibórz, 18.19° E, 50.08° N) in Poland for the period 2018–2021 via simple statistical models dealing with a limited number of predictors. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were examined separately for each season of the year using temperature, relative humidity, an hour of the day, and 1-day lagged surface ozone values.

The total column ozone (TCO3) datasets used are based on the ground-based (by the Dobson and/or Brewer spectrophotometer) measurements, satellite observations (from the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) and Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) instruments), and output of reanalyses (Multi-Sensor Reanalysis version 2 (MSR2) and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA2)). The TCO3 time series are calculated for selected sites in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (NH, 35–60∘ N), which are station locations with long-term TCO3 observations archived at the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC). The TCO3 monthly means (1980–2020) are averaged over the April–September period to obtain TCO3 time series for the warm sub-period of the year. Two types of the averaged TCO3 time series are considered: the original one and non-proxy time series with removed natural variability by a standard multiple regression model. The TCO3 time series were smoothed by the locally weighted scatterplot smoother (LOWESS) and the super smoother (SS). The smoothed TCO3 values in 1980, 1988, 1997, and 2020 were used to build ozone recovery indices (ORIs) in 2020. These are key years in the equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) time series for the period 1980–2020, i.e., the stratosphere was only slightly contaminated by ODS in 1980, 1988 is the year in which the EESC value is equal to its value at the end (2020), and in 1997, the EESC maximum was in mid-latitude stratosphere. The first proposed ORI, ORI1, is the normalized difference between the TCO3 values in 2020 and 1988. The second one, ORI2, is the percentage of the recovered TCO3 in 2020 since the ODS maximum. Following these definitions, the corresponding reference ranges (from −0.5 % to 1 % for ORI1 and from 40 % to 60 % for ORI2) are obtained by analyzing a set of possible EESC time series simulated via the Goddard automailer. The ozone recovery phases are classified comparing the current ORI values and their uncertainty ranges (by the bootstrapping) with these reference ranges. In the analyzed TCO3 time series, for specific combinations of datasets, data types, and the smoother used, we find faster (for ORI1 or ORI2 above the reference range) and slower (for ORI1 or ORI2 below the reference range) recovery in 2020 than that inferred from the EESC change, and a continuation of the TCO3 decline after the EESC peak (ORI2<0 %). Strong signal of the slower TCO3 recovery is found in Toronto, Hohenpeissenberg, Hradec Kralove, and Belsk. A continuation of ozone decline after the turnaround in ODS concentration is found in both the original and non-proxy time series from WOUDC (Toronto), SBUV and OMPS (Toronto, Arosa, Hohenpeissenberg, Uccle, Hradec Kralove, and Belsk), and MERRA2 data (Arosa, Hohenpeissenberg, Hradec Kralove, and Belsk)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a96"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"3119-3132","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a96"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724d","mniswId":"2026","title":"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","issn":"1680-7316","eissn":"1680-7324","documentHash":"767f0fa0-a1ba-4887-b209-a40652902fe4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6454bcb4409707605d5b81b5","year":"2023","volume":"23","number":"5","documentHash":"70a174fb-6507-49af-b708-f9d1ee81c0da"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058615613"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f782a31085dcb410a25e93a","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Niezabitowska-Śliwka","uuid":"D754F46BBAF95B873C362829BCB6AD49CD22BF0173B63D68F2A7D9A6B85F21F6A848A460A9B4714CBBA223E141AB86EE97AD90D2A424B74BCA2DABA9757CD2F3","documentHash":"0388b770-6f07-4be9-8f1f-d6dc7716f702"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7f5a","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Junosza-Szaniawski","uuid":"C48CEF41F4571E421C4629F6911AA79132E22A0C242EE059CBA8858B1370E709ACD1C5A3E95904F86634C86639A05322E3E9455F368E8B1466147EF44831E1E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-4957-8837","documentHash":"f8041c94-1d98-41d4-83e9-b7c84463e375"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"645d38c7409707440b2da025","doi":"10.1093/gji/ggad129","publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/gji/ggad129/49598659/ggad129.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Holy Cross Mountains (Poland) terranes palaeoposition and depositional environment in Silurian—new insights from rock magnetic studies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Holy Cross Mountains (HCM) in Poland, is an isolated natural outcrop of Palaeozoic rocks\nlocated within the Trans-European Suture Zone, a tectonic collage of continental terranes\nadjacent to the Tornquist margin of the Baltica. This uniqueness made the HCM a target for\npalaeogeographic research. Based on the facies differences, the HCM had been divided into two\nmajor units, the southern (the Kielce Unit) and northern (the Łysogory Unit) part (SHCM and ´\nNHCM, respectively). Their position in relation to each other and the Baltica continent during\nSilurian times is still a matter of discussion, whether both parts of the HCM were separated\nterranes located along the Baltica margin or they shared in common palaeogeographic history.\nHere, we present the results of comprehensive rock magnetic measurements applied as a tool\nto interpret palaeoenvironmental conditions during deposition and burial and therefore allow\ndiscussion about the terranes’ relative position. To recognize the magnetic mineral composition\nand texture of studied Silurian graptolitic shales several rock magnetic measurements were\nconducted including low-temperature Saturated Isothermal Remanent Magnetization, thermal\ndemagnetization of three-component IRM and hysteresis measurements, as well as anisotropy\nof magnetic susceptibility (AMS). The sampled rocks come from both units of the HCM.\nIn all analysed samples we found single domain (SD) stoichiometric magnetite of mostly\ndiagenetic (i.e. post-depositional) origin and goethite resulting likely from weathering. In turn,\ndetrital magnetite, even if observed in previously investigated Silurian rocks from the Baltica\nmargin, was not identified in this study, what we attribute to dissolution during diagenesis\nin the deep-water environment. Solely in the NHCM, SD hematite and maghemite grains\nwere observed, which we interpret as detrital in origin. These grains have been preserved in\nthe suboxic environment of the NHCM sub-basin bottom waters due to their resistance to\ndissolution in marine waters. Considering the deposition conditions (oxygenation of the nearbottom zone) rather similar for both HCM parts, we associate the presence of aeolian hematite\ngrains solely in the NHCM rocks with a more proximal position of the NHCM than the\nSHCM in relation to the Baltica continent during late Llandovery (Silurian). This conclusion\nagrees with some existing palaeogeographic models. In addition to petromagnetic studies\nfocused on the analysis of ferromagnets, AMS measurements were also carried out. The results\nindicate that the magnetic susceptibility is mainly governed by paramagnetic minerals, mostly\nphyllosilicates with small ferromagnetic contributions. Oblate AMS ellipsoid and distinct\nbedding parallel foliation indicate prevailing sedimentary-compactional alignment. Observed\nmagnetic lineation of tectonic origin resulting from weak strain is related presumably to\nVariscian deformations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709431878c28a0473b7f5a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"234","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1531-1549","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f782a31085dcb410a25e93a","5e709431878c28a0473b7f5a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e1b","mniswId":"7138","title":"GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL","issn":"0956-540X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c851e9ec-e6fe-42cb-a670-f1f47a5e1f28"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"645d38c7409707440b2da026","year":"2023","volume":"234","number":"3","documentHash":"c95deb5c-4e7e-41b5-b2f6-ad25c7316ea9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Magnetic mineralogy and petrology","Rock and mineral magnetism","Sedimentary basin processes","Llandovery (Silurian) mudstones","Europe"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058629263"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"643d4696409707219a511b0a","name":"Andrzej P.","lastName":"Radliński","documentHash":"5f4b5a78-d94e-465b-aa41-6ffbc7473c2f"},{"objectId":"643d4696409707219a511b09","name":"Max P.","lastName":"Cooper","documentHash":"d139db6c-1e29-4182-ab60-cc2b9991f573"},{"objectId":"643d4696409707219a511b08","name":"Rishabh P.","lastName":"Sharma","documentHash":"fbac636a-644d-480a-8b71-845ec5bbf384"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa13","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Białecki","uuid":"E3B18B5049E9F50FA8A41D492600C3A9F5AC8FAFA6BB9E429C8F05FE15F84734521C49A5519B3652B04064B398079023DE1DB5BB093B0DF6C86241ED8845A7BE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4970-2268","documentHash":"565edb5c-5bbe-4c6f-b45c-074f2d10f94c"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7ba1","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Szymczak","uuid":"B98702A400072575205821FF1BB2A003E057605E0AA498BA7F7B914221FE6FED6F768A88BF7E5241B6CD181A7DFFCE72DB528F00F915D08B1B0D88DF86B4E04B","orcidId":"0000-0001-8940-7891","documentHash":"a9252e8d-f4da-45d6-9221-65e275521280"}],"objectId":"643d4696409707219a511b06","doi":"10.1016/j.chemgeo.2023.121397","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0009254123000979?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Pore merging and flow focusing: Comparative study of undissolved and karstified limestone based on microtomography","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We develop methods for qualitative and quantitative assessment of pore geometry transformation within a rock as a result of karstification.

Partially dissolved samples collected in the immediate vicinity of the pipes were compared with undissolved samples collected 1.5 meters away. For both types of samples 26 micron resolution grayscale X-ray scans were performed. The irregular geometry of the pore space, the vast majority of which forms a single connected component, can be conveniently characterized by a local thickness function that corresponds to the diameter of the largest sphere that fits within the pore space and contains a given point. We compare the local thickness distributions of the undissolved and dissolved samples as well as a numerically generated uniformly dissolved sample. Such a comparison allows us to quantify the extent of homogeneity of the natural karstification process.

We screened the\nentire state database and two another data sources applying the criterion for zero-flow event: discharge less than 0.0005 $m^{3}∙s^{–1}$, and found five intermittent rivers with catchment area from 9.2 to 303.7 $km^{2}$. We aimed at finding associations between intermittence and climatic driving forces (temperature and precipitation), and between intermittence and anthropogenic activity. We used the Spearman correlation coefficient, circular statistics, and statistical tests for trend. The concentration of zero-flow days, mostly in summer, and the decreasing trend in the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) in all catchments at various aggregation levels, and an increasing trend in the total number of zero-flow days and in the maximum length of zero flow events in two rivers, were detected. The strong negative correlation (-0.62 ≤ ρ < 0) between intermittence and the SPEI backward lagged in time showed that intermittence resulted from prolonged deficits in climatic water balance due to increasing evapotranspiration. The reaction of the Noteć catchment, amplified by the anthropogenic pressure (brown coal mines), was reflected in the atypical shape of the rose diagram and in inhomogeneities in river discharges. The results show that the rose diagram can serve as an indicator of the degree of anthropogenic impact on runoff conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","uid":"br7hcJFLf6iH-raneJQQ4Eg","uuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","name":"Instytut Technologiczno-Przyrodniczy - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709257878c28a04739414b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","parentUuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","rootUuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709496878c28a0473c0015","5e709313878c28a0473a276b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"57 (4-6)","pagesFromTo":"52-61","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709309878c28a0473a1890","5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","5e709313878c28a0473a276b","5e709257878c28a04739414b","5e709496878c28a0473c0015"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a0a5","mniswId":"24534","title":"Journal of Water and Land Development","issn":"1429-7426","eissn":"2083-4535","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"a4c28353-5629-4ead-811e-faca8a6d47ac"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"651536d64097070ba4cda275","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"4-6","number":"57","documentHash":"7ef8a25d-5b36-444f-9692-06cad5729d36"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["circular  statistics","climatic  and  anthropogenic  impacts","river  flow  intermittence","standardised evapotranspiration index","trend in flow intermittence"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058646807"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646e122c40970770404fe2c7","name":"Naser","lastName":"Golsanami","documentHash":"5d9d9943-3c62-4565-a4ca-4db381db4c8b"},{"objectId":"646e122c40970770404fe2c6","name":"Bo","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"c1e0880f-6e0c-4789-a8fd-a6f384231e4e"},{"objectId":"646e122c40970770404fe2c5","name":"Qamar","lastName":"Yasin","documentHash":"551b9bd0-1492-48cc-af11-5c3ff6f270a8"},{"objectId":"626c9f287523406b88d07165","name":"Ali","lastName":"Gholami","uuid":"2ECFC5AEAA28B4DAD17F4C5C0367B433AF78932977245DE38DB09A380B3BFA2863C72FB1FB8D83DF61D772FF31E66FC0BF8B853605CF814E843959FE40EB305B","documentHash":"244d54a5-c672-476b-ae86-a8fdf8a92e8d"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Majdański","uuid":"89D7E80830B607723CEFEDCFBDA5FC52ECA8EFD548784730711C4D8752516F3FD892A2BCEDA865B4737074B27716938ACD71EC45855B87BECB169C65C89CD172","orcidId":"0000-0002-8909-4407","documentHash":"0b6165bd-7e9b-4ab0-9954-9e96b9ceabf6"}],"objectId":"646e122c40970770404fe2c3","doi":"10.1016/j.geothermics.2023.102749","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0375650523001037?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Seismic characterization of geologically complex geothermal reservoirs by combining structure-oriented filtering and attributes analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In geothermal systems, the geologic structure is a decisive factor in controlling fluid flow. Several geothermal systems around the world are located in complex geological structures, such as closely spaced and intersecting faults and fractures, folds, and dykes. Seismic data provides high-resolution images of complex structures that can be used to explore geothermal reservoirs. In fact, faults and fractures have subtle geologic edges that produce significant lateral variations in seismic data. Volumetric seismic attributes are quite effective for detecting these discontinuities in seismic data but are sensitive to noise and velocity accuracy. In North China, a deeply buried carbonate structure presents a geologically complex system with fault-controlled geothermal circulation. However, due to the deep burial depth and structural complexity, seismic reflection beneath the buried-hill has a low-quality, making it difficult to detect the characteristics of the fault edges. In this study, we first develop a structural architecture of the buried-hill carbonate reservoirs to show the development characteristics in vertical and plane directions. Next, we propose an intelligent workflow based on structure-oriented filtering and sensitive seismic attributes to investigate structural complexity (faults and fractures) in the basin for geothermal reservoir exploration. The results show that by combining the proposed structure-oriented filtering and sensitive volumetric seismic attributes, we can generate high-resolution seismic images to characterize fault edges, geometries, and fracture anomalies in structurally complex settings in order to identify upflow locations along the faults and fractures in geothermal systems. We further validated the fracture networks distribution by superimposing the extracted attributes with seismic fault networks and fracture density map using multilayer feedforward neural network. This workflow provides a reliable basis for the characterization of geothermal reservoirs in deep-buried and structurally controlled geothermal fields."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["626c9f287523406b88d07165","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"112","pagesFromTo":"102749","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646e122c40970770404fe2c5","626c9f287523406b88d07165","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","646e122c40970770404fe2c6","646e122c40970770404fe2c7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e31","mniswId":"7177","title":"Geothermics","issn":"0375-6505","eissn":"1879-3576","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/geothermics/","documentHash":"c02d98d1-52fa-4ac5-8674-78485137bfc9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646e122c40970770404fe2c4","year":"2023","volume":"112","documentHash":"bc896daa-9c72-45e8-aae8-ea4b6eadaf50"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058646835"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"624f9e287523402df09e3128","name":"Nicole","lastName":"Hanselmann","uuid":"A465F7CC1E41E58B641D95DDC749FF2FCF52712840A3BC929F8EC0B1925FEE6C4BBFF8B0D5CBB0FF1F16A50C522CC86B3C04D69EF3FDDDC281FB7F0C6388E13B","documentHash":"a9baacac-31e4-46fb-94df-6bac94a449b8"},{"objectId":"61d3bf387523401fc1107870","name":"Abhishek Bamby","lastName":"Alphonse","uuid":"8572D6B741E7B872E124803CCED875BCC58676B065C012ED8A4AE7B84C9A98DE6E3D81B81FB69DA92BA479EF547E33D8BAE0ADD01AA5B140DDEF0707F3497D5F","documentHash":"4ec7c75f-0e0b-4ab9-b2fb-0f0829c788b7"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Osuch","uuid":"A15CE4704BFC55F4D73C5551A1BF8F722C8079811C8D2926C74DE5E2098F109CCBA98FF443EA760E7212470B8FEC3F616067AD3C9D8E6C8BEC9D2B1C3908DE94","orcidId":"0000-0002-1887-3569","documentHash":"447f1351-672a-4b79-b06d-7741f68786bb"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"C0584C144462F702B3240BEAC5B59EE267B2C41FD0108E80ADE2625711EBE1965DBD3F8183578828BBA3059F994E33D86CACFD8B0B3788616E7BE27271E913B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3393-753X","documentHash":"e1b00415-43de-446c-8e75-68765156a8a8"}],"objectId":"63e63feb4097072ac2af1370","doi":"10.3390/rs15040934","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/4/934/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Applying UAV-Based Remote Sensing Observation Products in High Arctic Catchments in SW Spitsbergen","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the age of remote sensing, particularly with new generation Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), there is a broad spectrum of applications, especially in remote and rapidly changing areas such as the Arctic. Due to challenging conditions in this region, there is a scarcity of detailed spatial studies with data that may be used to estimate changes in glacier volume and geomorphological changes caused by permafrost freeze–thaw cycles. Drone-based Digital Elevation Models (DEM) offer a finer spatial resolution with higher accuracy than airborne and satellite-based products that can be used for acquiring, interpreting, and precisely representing spatial data in broad studies. In this study, we evaluate a UAV-based DEM of two High Arctic catchments, Fuglebekken and Ariebekken, located on Spitsbergen Island. The surveys were carried out in July 2022 using a DJI Matrice 300 RTK drone equipped with a photogrammetric Zenmuse P1 camera. A total of 371 images were taken, covering an area of 7.81 km2. The DEM was created by the Structure-from-Motion technique and achieved a centimetre-level accuracy by overlapping very high-resolution images. The final resolution of the DEM was found to be 0.06 m in Fuglebekken and 0.07 m in Ariebekken, with a horizontal and vertical RMSE of 0.09 m and 0.20 m, respectively. The DJI Matrice 300 RTK drone-based DEM is compared and correlated with the aerial mission of the Svalbard Integrated Arctic Earth Observing System (SIOS) conducted in July 2020 and the satellite-based ArcticDEM acquired in July 2018. This allowed the detection of elevation changes and identification of landscape evolution, such as moraine breaches and coastal erosion. We also highlight the usage of DEM in providing detailed morphometric characteristics and hydrological parameters, such as the delineation of catchments and stream channels.

SKS and SKKS phases were analysed using the minimum energy and the rotation-correlation method to determine average splitting parameters (φ, δt), characterizing orientation and strength of mantle anisotropy. The observations were interpreted in terms of one-layer anisotropy with a horizontal symmetry axis. The average fast polarization azimuth for this region is equal to ∼113°, and the delay time to ∼1.1 s. The results document a large-scale trend of the upper mantle fabric with NW-SE to WNW-ESE orientation, coinciding with fast velocity axes obtained from the shallower lithospheric studies of the Pn and Pg phases. At smaller scale, anisotropy parameters seem to vary between the SW and NE regions, suggesting moderate differences in orientation of the mantle fabric. Small-scale variations are likely to reflect anisotropy changes related to differences between lithospheric blocks, while more uniform large-scale trend may be related with fabric induced by asthenospheric flow. Estimated thickness of the anisotropic layer exceeds the thickness of the mantle lithosphere, supporting plausibility of substantial asthenospheric contribution. According to previous studies, the large-scale trend of fast polarizations observed in the Sudetes extends also over broader area located to the SW of the Teisseyre-Tornquist Zone, independently of the orientation of the tectonic sutures and of lithospheric inhomogeneity, suggesting its asthenospheric origin. The trend runs obliquely to the plate motion direction, but is sub-parallel to the NW-SE-striking margin of thick East European Craton lithosphere located to the NE of the study area, supporting the concept of the mantle flow re-oriented to ∼NW-SE direction by a thick cratonic keel."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["642cdd2940e3ff13873cd1f0","5e709439878c28a0473b875e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"846","pagesFromTo":"229687","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["642cdd2940e3ff13873cd1f0","5e709439878c28a0473b875e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798ea","mniswId":"19321","title":"Tectonophysics","issn":"0040-1951","eissn":"1879-3266","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/tectonophysics/","documentHash":"1a0f4239-1e53-4724-95c2-da2dc6d27d0c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64549f1f409707605d59ea0c","year":"2023","volume":"846","documentHash":"205c525a-c4d2-4dde-bc8a-e8e0d4ae63aa"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Seismic anisotropyUpper mantleShear-wave splittingVariscidesPolish SudetesBohemian Massif"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058667232"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba083","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Czechowski","uuid":"976B2A0264185DF857CD5C01AD98E8D626E20E3C1122C6110C5874505B167AC0199768138BC6DF21BA366BD4F6C2B552D9B0D854F3A9DFA1F70C5743B7FD5E91","orcidId":"0000-0002-7806-6726","documentHash":"735452b6-a66f-4d24-93aa-6bea71dd143d"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1e3e","name":"Monika","lastName":"Petelczyc","uuid":"2766D3BC3999DDDC9AD6A6647F6BACEB2C89C0813F8C27C697CC36E5E3981AC337E9F954CFBAD03CB70EDDF21BBC9EE7773B08221D66F43C610FE05DCF268A4D","orcidId":"0000-0001-8051-0577","documentHash":"a9478ed3-b4b6-4f98-a44d-98335596f38d"}],"objectId":"6454c653409707605d5c393d","doi":"10.1063/5.0141160","publicUri":"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article-split/33/5/053107/2888088/Effect-of-nonlinearity-and-persistence-on","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Effect of nonlinearity and persistence on multiscale irreversibility, non-stationarity, and complexity of time series—Case of data generated by the modified Langevin model","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Stochastic models of a time series can take the form of a nonlinear equation and have a built-in memory mechanism. Generated time series can be characterized by measures of certain features, e.g., non-stationarity, irreversibility, irregularity, multifractality, and short/long-tail distribution. Knowledge of the relationship between the form of the model and features of data seems to be the key to model time series. The paper presents a systematic analysis of the multiscale behavior of selected measures of irreversibility, irregularity, and non-stationarity vs degree of nonlinearity and persistence. As a time series generator, the modified nonlinear Langevin equation with built-in persistence is adopted. The modes of nonlinearity are determined by one parameter and do not change the half-Gaussian form of the marginal distribution function. The expected direct dependencies (sometimes non-trivial) were found and explained using the simplicity of the model. It has been shown that the change in nonlinearity, although subjected to a strong constraint (the same marginal distribution), causes significant changes in the tested markers of irregularity and non-stationarity. However, a synergy of non-linearity and persistence is needed to induce greater changes in irreversibility.</jats:p>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba083"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1-11","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70930d878c28a0473a1e3e","5e70944d878c28a0473ba083"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775bb","mniswId":"3449","title":"Chaos","issn":"1054-1500","eissn":"1089-7682","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5096a57d-3cce-4ecf-8ec7-9dd072e8f825"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058667516"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c990","name":"Artur","lastName":"Marciniak","uuid":"5218C630BD00E1D15FDE8DD95D286784DA876E0E8000313F823180BBF748D7DC9F0A8023A1F90AFE9C5AD5782E365D07C763275DF0F9E05D63FA3DF6DD9BDA9E","documentHash":"64902d05-2f25-441a-b4b1-d9cdb1529f5c"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f402","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Stan-Kłeczek","uuid":"C379F73F845B4CA18EDB428D0D8BB33F9C0FAD008A657170887C5B1972687F8B88AE9383D48CBD027AF79973FD380859CB3EF8187B5D644AA90EFE10627494BC","orcidId":"0000-0003-0757-5926","documentHash":"54b9d6d2-534d-430a-bcfd-d9c9e80c9864"}],"objectId":"6492ed454097075432ca6924","doi":"10.1016/j.jrmge.2023.03.005","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1674775523000951?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Recognition of rock anisotropy using integrated seismic approach – A case in Strzegom and Podleśna, Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the integration of seismic refraction and multichannel analysis of surface wave (MASW) measurements to investigate the anisotropy of P- and S-wave velocities. Additionally, synthetic forward modelling is presented as a tool for supporting seismic anisotropy studies. The geophysical measurements of cracks allowed to recognise the fracturing of a granite rock mass in a Paleozoic granite quarry (Strzegom, Poland) and a dolomite rock mass in a Triassic dolomite quarry (Podleśna, Poland). Application of the forward modelling supports the interpretation of seismic methods, simplifying data processing and verifying the final results based on data from difficult seismic conditions. As a result of direct measurements, two crack systems were determined in granite rock mass: NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE, and two in dolomite rock mass: NNE-SSW and NW-SE. Furthermore, the numerical results show the relationship between the highest values of P- and S-wave velocities and separated crack systems which allowed an unequivocal interpretation of the direction of stress, resulting in the deformations. The obtained information is promising to be helpful in mining exploration for optimising excavation

post‐earthquake cascading hazards: Changing patterns of landslide runout following the 2015 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Coseismic landslides represent the first stage of a broader cascading sequence of geohazards associated with high-magnitude continental earthquakes, with the subsequent remobilization of coseismic landslide debris posing a long-term post-seismic legacy in mountain regions. Here, we quantify the controls on the hazard posed by landslide remobilization and debris runout, and compare the overlap between areas at risk of runout and the pattern of post-seismic landslides and debris flows that actually occurred. Focusing on the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, we show that the extent of the area that could be affected by debris runout remained elevated above coseismic levels 4.5 years after the event. While 150 km2 (0.6% of the study area) was directly impacted by landslides in the earthquake, an additional 614 km2 (2.5%) was left at risk from debris runout, increasing to 777 km2 (3.2%) after the 2019 monsoon. We evaluate how this area evolved by comparing modelled predictions of runout from coseismic landslides to multi-temporal post-seismic landslide inventories, and find that 14% (85 km2) of the total modelled potential runout area experienced landslide activity within 4.5 years after the earthquake. This value increases to 32% when modelled runout probability is thresholded, equivalent to 10 km2 of realized runout from a remaining modelled area of 32 km2. Although the proportion of the modelled runout area from coseismic landslides that remains a hazard has decreased through time, the overall runout susceptibility for the study area remains high. This indicates that runout potential is changing both spatially and temporally as a result of changes to the landslide distribution after the earthquake. These findings are particularly important for understanding evolving patterns of cascading hazards following large earthquakes, which is crucial for guiding decision-making associated with post-seismic recovery and reconstruction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61bd55b87523404d4a8fb735"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"48","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"537-554","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646de4bf40970770404aff1f","646de4bf40970770404aff20","646de4bf40970770404aff21","646de4bf40970770404aff22","646de4bf40970770404aff23","646de4bf40970770404aff24","646de4bf40970770404aff25","61bd55b87523404d4a8fb735","646de4bf40970770404aff26","646de4bf40970770404aff27"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779da","mniswId":"5270","title":"Earth Surface Processes and Landforms","issn":"0197-9337","eissn":"1096-9837","documentHash":"44f628e5-89dd-4bc9-b109-c7e3515414cb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646de58840970770404b0bb8","year":"2023","volume":"3","number":"48","doi":"","documentHash":"b4bb7075-63fc-47b4-87d7-fb2be62c0431"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058697864"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646df4ab40970770404ca742","name":"Robert T.","lastName":"Pidgeon","documentHash":"e9427329-e3ad-414d-8a11-9c49cc1c5061"},{"objectId":"646df4ab40970770404ca741","name":"Simon A.","lastName":"Wilde","documentHash":"fc7ce069-4b51-4055-8bf1-6f5a6285d474"},{"objectId":"646df4ab40970770404ca740","name":"Richard","lastName":"Wirth","documentHash":"1465f145-0eb9-4be3-bf03-1889c50c2074"},{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kusiak","uuid":"3052A19F570F1180C90FE5ED9510A53FCEA3A401B154BB701C443A248D410748C9CFEB65CF60BA418E2ECBD9AAFA204B99C32FF77545357BEC09625DF52F2ECD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2042-8621","documentHash":"10e63152-d296-4f9a-9487-cad0a39065f2"}],"objectId":"646df4ab40970770404ca73f","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-27843-6","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27843-6.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Metallic lead (Pb) nanospheres discovered in Hadean and Eoarchean zircon crystals at Jack Hills","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Here, we report small randomly-distributed crystalline lead (Pb) nanospheres occurring in detrital zircon grains obtained from a weakly metamorphosed Archean conglomerate at Jack Hills, Western Australia, making this the third known global example of this phenomenon. They form in zircon crystals ranging from Hadean (> 4 billion years—Ga) to Eoarchean (> 3.6 Ga) in age, but are absent from Paleoarchean (~ 3.4 Ga) crystals. Unlike previous discoveries of nanospheres in zircon from Precambrian gneisses in Antarctica and India, detrital zircon from Jack Hills shows no evidence of ever undergoing ultra-high temperature (UHT) metamorphism, either before or after deposition, therefore implying that nanospheres can form at temperatures lower than ca. 900 °C. The nanospheres are composed of radiogenic Pb released by the breakdown of uranium (U) and thorium (Th) and are present in zircon irrespective of its U, Th and water contents, its oxygen isotopic composition, and the degree of discordance due to Pb loss or gain. The nanospheres pre-date annealed cracks in the crystals, showing that, once formed, they effectively ‘freeze’ radiogenic Pb in the zircon structure, precluding any further interaction during subsequent geological processes. Both Pb nanoclusters and nanospheres are now reported from Jack Hills, and it appears likely the former is a precursor stage in the formation of the latter. Although the precise mechanism for this transition remains unresolved, a later thermal event is required, but this likely did not reach UHT conditions at Jack Hills."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

The estimated variation will be useful for interpreting the sound in marine-terminating glaciers bays in terms of the submarine-melting activity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a047399421","5e7093b2878c28a0473af532"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"3","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"20801","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64749c4d40970710109835fd","64749c4d40970710109835fe","5e70929e878c28a047399421","64749c4d40970710109835ff","64749c4d4097071010983600","5e7093b2878c28a0473af532","64749c4d4097071010983601"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb7e7","mniswId":"30040","title":"JASA Express Letters","eissn":"2691-1191","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"f0677f49-872d-4762-a417-2ef547b57f9a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64749c4d40970710109835fc","year":"2023","volume":"3","number":"2","documentHash":"fec7ba59-72f3-4a56-ae92-a3402c84657d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058707662"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64773ac74097071bcb5ac540","name":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Tursi","documentHash":"a643e356-3ebb-4b60-a893-1e89518553b6"},{"objectId":"64773ac74097071bcb5ac53f","name":"Marilena","lastName":"Filippucci","documentHash":"9f047a4a-c741-459d-81ac-ef351a6a792d"},{"objectId":"64773ac74097071bcb5ac53e","name":"Salvatore","lastName":"Mazza","documentHash":"e8de15a8-ffeb-42af-8d2d-ccc2da423bc3"},{"objectId":"64773ac74097071bcb5ac53d","name":"Giulio","lastName":"Selvaggi","documentHash":"4b6c11c3-b397-4249-87ee-2f8f480d14a4"},{"objectId":"64773ac74097071bcb5ac53c","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Ninivaggi","documentHash":"a8dd03bd-2967-47cd-9bb4-430fbc787348"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba04a","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Czuba","uuid":"3225CC1B7D0D3ABB26A538FEB44AC3F72F40427CDE497F5F961D5963BE41E91CC6CFFD862C16949DC824ED367B2F15BD9C9566B5B71791760C8A6A00C7D1D3DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3387-9336","documentHash":"0103c954-e11f-4c0c-b147-dd2af233b2a1"}],"objectId":"64773ac74097071bcb5ac53a","doi":"10.1016/j.tecto.2023.229919","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0040195123002172?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Nature and origin of an undetected seismic phase in waveforms from Southern Tyrrhenian (Italy) intermediate-depth and deep earthquakes: First evidence for the phase-A in the subducted Uppermost Lithospheric Mantle?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We have found a previously unreported later seismic phase in seismograms of European seismic stations from intermediate-depth and deep earthquakes of the Southern Tyrrhenian subduction zone.

The latter results in the zircon being partially or totally replaced by new, compositionally re-equilibrated zircon or a new mineral phase or both. In this study, fragments (50–300 μm) from a large, inclusion-free, clear, 520–530 Ma euhedral zircon with light radiation damage from a nepheline syenite pegmatite, Seiland Igneous Province, northern Norway, were experimentally reacted in 20 mg batches with 5 mg of ThO2 + ThSiO2 + SiO2 and a series of alkali-bearing fluids in sealed Pt capsules at 900 °C and 1000 MPa for 6–11 days in the piston cylinder press using a CaF2 setup with a cylindrical graphite oven. ThO2 + ThSiO2 + SiO2 was present at the end of the experiment. In experiments involving H2O, H2O + NaCl, H2O + KCl, and 2 N KOH, no reaction textures formed other than a slight dissolution of the zircon grain fragments. Experiments involving 2 N NaOH, Na2Si2O5 + H2O, and NaF + H2O resulted in zircon reaction textures with varying degrees of intensity, which took the form of partial replacement by compositionally modified zircon via a coupled dissolution-reprecipitation process. In the NaF + H2O experiment some overgrowth also occurred. Altered zircon is separated by sharp compositional boundaries from unaltered zircon. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analysis indicates that, relative to the unaltered zircon, the altered zircon is strongly enriched in Th, and heavily to moderately depleted in U and (Y + REE). In all the experiments, 206Pb (3–5 ppm in unaltered zircon) is depleted in the altered zircon to below the SIMS detection limit and to at or below the LA-ICP-MS detection limit. Hafnium and Ti concentrations in the altered zircon retained the same approximate value (within error) as the original zircon. The results from these experiments demonstrate that zircon can be compositionally modified by alkali-bearing and alkali-F-bearing fluids via a coupled dissolution-reprecipitation process. Near to total loss of radiogenic Pb via such processes under high-grade conditions resets the internal zircon geochronometer. Although the end result is the same as with zircon overgrowth, i.e. the production of new generation zircon at the time of a metamorphic/metasomatic event, such replacement processes can explain incomplete isotopic ‘resetting’; inclusion production through unmixing of solid solutions in metastable zircon compositions; and ‘ghost’ textures that preserve initial growth features but with isotopic disturbance. Diagnostic replacement features produced in experiments, such as interface geometries between altered and unaltered zircon, provide markers of the mechanism and aid in zircon interpretation. A major implication from this study is that if zircon with low radiation damage can be metasomatically altered under high-grade conditions, this would have important consequences with respect to zircons presumed role as an impregnable container for mineral inclusions. Namely the mineral inclusions contained within zircon could also be altered, reset as a geochronometer, or even replaced by another mineral."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f5b4028752340073806a9b5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"352","pagesFromTo":"222-235","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6479beb54097070bf864fbbf","6479beb54097070bf864fbc0","5f5b4028752340073806a9b5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00e0ead49b31ccedf5503","title":"Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","issn":"0016-7037","eissn":"1872-9533","documentHash":"4cbce49f-eb63-4fe0-8098-e078e923a413"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6479beb54097070bf864fbbe","year":"2023","volume":"352","documentHash":"f888417e-5333-4151-8546-35a30b7c6115"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ZirconTh, U, Pb, REEPetrochronologyCoupled dissolution-reprecipitationAlkali-bearing fluidsExperimental petrology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058711245"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"642a9ca3409707382bf5c7be","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Spolaor","documentHash":"c6956002-cf9f-4fdb-9372-e9d6719d0140"},{"objectId":"642a9ca3409707382bf5c7bd","name":"Beatrice","lastName":"Moroni","documentHash":"8327ef5c-3608-441a-824a-d5913be6f932"},{"objectId":"642a9ca3409707382bf5c7bc","name":"Federica","lastName":"Bruschi","documentHash":"282a5012-4e66-4cef-aa35-5961ee25ab16"},{"objectId":"642a9ca3409707382bf5c7bb","name":"Stefano","lastName":"Crocchianti","documentHash":"4866e6d9-212d-47cf-afbb-edc0dcecb1ae"},{"objectId":"642a9ca3409707382bf5c7ba","name":"Jean Charles","lastName":"Gallet","documentHash":"dae32e91-5044-4dc6-a69e-9e24b3cb9656"},{"objectId":"642a9ca3409707382bf5c7b9","name":"Paolo","lastName":"Tuccella","documentHash":"6578adad-7c23-49e6-8a89-55cf805fbc10"},{"objectId":"642a9ca3409707382bf5c7b8","name":"Catherine","lastName":"Larose","documentHash":"002a1e54-3118-457f-b056-f57efff0b10b"},{"objectId":"642a9ca3409707382bf5c7b7","name":"Laurynas","lastName":"Bučinskas","documentHash":"b377ce1d-8be3-44a8-8390-651aa3c0625d"},{"objectId":"642a9ca3409707382bf5c7b6","name":"Justina","lastName":"Šapolaitė","documentHash":"c3330cd6-f514-4f60-be31-ad2d36fadc1a"},{"objectId":"642a9ca3409707382bf5c7b5","name":"Žilvinas","lastName":"Ežerinskis","documentHash":"887284e3-4a9a-4e35-bd02-ce60489cae0c"},{"objectId":"642a9ca3409707382bf5c7b4","name":"David","lastName":"Cappelletti","documentHash":"524d3bca-bdc7-4ad2-b7e1-df7cc1a792d5"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Luks","uuid":"FC0F8C1A25CDF854727B23DAF6DD04D1AD9513696FBFA8C968355CC0EFB6A3BDEB4F2A5DDD1AE5371489624E4D31807972D8B5C54FCC96768719FBBC97225A9F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2287-385X","documentHash":"3f73f8a6-7975-4c35-be1a-579f2ca67494"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a23c8","name":"Adam","lastName":"Nawrot","uuid":"62E26EB8A7FD937B6F4EC478E5F86852F14D84281B3DDBE242AA1B58FF7741578B6ECC7A4C19192C210949FB912077FF7C3A914E35B207156C9A9722F02B6B1A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6619-6478","documentHash":"c0165202-67c7-4155-873c-b372458e73bc"}],"objectId":"642a9ca3409707382bf5c7b3","doi":"10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.131317","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S030438942300599X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Long-range transport and deposition on the Arctic snowpack of nuclear contaminated particulate matter","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The primary environmental concern related to nuclear power is the production of radioactive waste hazardous to humans and the environment. The main scientific and technological problems to address this are related to the storage and disposal of the nuclear waste and monitoring the dispersion of radioactive species into the environment. In this work, we determined an anomalously high 14C activity, well above the modern natural background, on surface and seasonal snow sampled in early May 2019 on glaciers in the Hornsund fjord area (Svalbard). Due to the lack of local sources, the high snow concentrations of 14C suggest long-range atmospheric transport of nuclear waste particles from lower latitudes, where nuclear power plants and treatment stations are located. The analysis of the synoptic and local meteorological data allowed us to associate the long-range transport of this anomalous 14C concentration to an intrusion event of a warm and humid air mass that likely brought pollutants from Central Europe to the Arctic in late April 2019. Elemental and organic carbon, trace element concentration data, and scanning electron microscopy morphological analysis were performed on the same snow samples to better constrain the transport process that might have led to the high 14C radionuclide concentrations in Svalbard. In particular, the highest 14C values found in the snowpack (> 200 percent of Modern Carbon, pMC) were associated with the lowest OC/EC ratios (< 4), an indication of an anthropogenic industrial source, and with the presence of spherical particles rich in iron, zirconium, and titanium which, altogether, suggest an origin related to nuclear waste reprocessing plants. This study highlights the role of long-range transport in exposing Arctic environments to human pollution. Given that the frequency and intensity of these atmospheric warming events are predicted to increase due to ongoing climate change, improving our knowledge of their possible impact to Arctic pollution is becoming urgent."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f","5e709310878c28a0473a23c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"452","pagesFromTo":"131317","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["642a9ca3409707382bf5c7b4","642a9ca3409707382bf5c7b5","642a9ca3409707382bf5c7b6","642a9ca3409707382bf5c7b7","5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f","5e709310878c28a0473a23c8","642a9ca3409707382bf5c7b8","642a9ca3409707382bf5c7b9","642a9ca3409707382bf5c7ba","642a9ca3409707382bf5c7bb","642a9ca3409707382bf5c7bc","642a9ca3409707382bf5c7bd","642a9ca3409707382bf5c7be"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547874d","mniswId":"11283","title":"JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS","issn":"0304-3894","documentHash":"9e422f9b-3018-499d-934c-ffabaf1b5463"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"641d5d1b4097077035b7df91","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"452","documentHash":"9ebabd63-a400-4d00-b6e8-e24eab4da5c6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058714328"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c2fcd59543c72336543405","name":"Tesfaye ","lastName":"Senbeta","uuid":"4DD156EBF189A2DF2A17EBB3495718A700D0E06FBB0E0C93A59FA4BFCD6FB7840A21808EB09BABE5A076D4B4349F7ACA50CFD044395891204F38955479EB3D98","documentHash":"1e75a733-8758-4a2f-bb2c-a2d21b410521"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Napiórkowski","uuid":"6AE9EEECF23A9027016CE0A5043569229D6A23680190D0C326173C1E6985FE82CE8B15504F7C20E43EC7B867AD3C2CF79197D909B3D518AC611E0C30D884583C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0273-4193","documentHash":"03e7ee2b-1337-4436-8dc2-d4e7730e5939"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdf","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Karamuz","uuid":"42510623665FE0F9C3E90EFFBE52337DCA2E7F6274643BDAB5CD13591E0EDB68962EF018F363C9A1A8E2C85E685741F5523AFC7B270A7EAEB97A679F3C4E5C7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-7226-7412","documentHash":"3bf44037-d31d-40de-9945-7be966f84232"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a95","name":"Renata","lastName":"Romanowicz","uuid":"8852F391FED002F88DF8E975E39E80E1448D517F156B51BC924B80837048746DA9D2564227C3672C38F954F8CB2CE1A85129A7C4824A3F0DE1E2F05F30F786D9","orcidId":"0000-0003-0457-6376","documentHash":"631ec103-e067-4a6b-a5e1-305646dbade7"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af53a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kochanek","uuid":"C58488034FF37B76FD4EE222820FDCF292BACD4A7253416E1B866FBD655E60B2674E031CBD51914F5FC6482D4F4E519CA58E659EAFD9B3F0523C8BE896366892","orcidId":"0000-0001-6631-7383","documentHash":"5f2f6dd5-d225-4c99-988f-874a7d18d004"}],"objectId":"6453a0354097075bae332135","doi":"10.1080/02626667.2023.2187297","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02626667.2023.2187297","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Budyko-based approach for modelling water balance dynamics considering environmental change drivers in the Vistula River basin, Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"2 Data and study area descriptions\n3 Methodology\n4 Results\n5 Discussion\n6 Conclusion and future works\nAcknowledgements\nDisclosure statement\nAdditional information\nReferences\n Full Article  Figures & data  References  Citations  Metrics  Licensing  Reprints & Permissions  View PDFView EPUB\nABSTRACTFormulae display:MathJax Logo?\nThe spatiotemporal variations in the water balance caused by environmental changes lead to unsteady-state conditions with long- and short-term implications for social and economic conditions. The aim of this study is to extend the current knowledge of the Budyko approach in unsteady-state conditions and the importance of model structural uncertainties. We used three Budyko-based models (Turc-Pike, Zhang, Fu) with and without the concept of effective precipitation scenarios. The effective precipitation and model parameters were determined together during the calibration processes. The effective precipitation-based approach improved the model performance in predicting the annual water balance in most of the River Vistula catchment. We also discuss the importance of considering structural uncertainties in water balance modelling. Climate change is the main driver for the changes in the water balance of the River Vistula. The estimation of water balance dynamics, considering environmental changes, is essential to understand the changes in hydrological processes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fcd59543c72336543405","5e709410878c28a0473b5a95","5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","5e7093b2878c28a0473af53a","5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-15","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c2fcd59543c72336543405","5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdf","5e7093b2878c28a0473af53a","5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","5e709410878c28a0473b5a95"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f82","mniswId":"7816","title":"Hydrological Sciences Journal","issn":"0262-6667","eissn":"2150-3435","documentHash":"7ce7357a-b6a4-4177-a129-11ed500af22c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6453a0354097075bae332136","year":"2023","documentHash":"714b731f-8f61-4d74-b5e4-91849eb21baa"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058770106"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Krzyścin","uuid":"6AD82B7788E5B235D0100D0DD2F05BC12ADF71BABA36528B207E410E3E98418CE51603E68A8F27C444B4A2F3FA4B89F000E7F6CE90621B70778345877C60C011","orcidId":"0000-0002-3138-3951","documentHash":"81041a42-caf6-4771-9710-7828de8dacfb"}],"objectId":"6454bdb9409707605d5b94ad","doi":"10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.119543","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1352231022006082?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Trends in short-term variability of total column ozone over Europe for the period 1980–2020 from the ground-based observations and ERA5 reanalysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study is to analyse daily fluctuations in total column ozone (TCO3) to look for trends in characteristics of the passage of low/high TCO3 systems across Europe in the period 1980–2020. For each season of the year in the period 1980–2020, the sample of one-day change in TCO3 as the percentage of the mean ozone for two consecutive days is calculated for twelve ground-based stations with long-term and frequent TCO3 observations. For comparison purposes, the corresponding ERA5 reanalysis data are also considered. Using the seasonal samples of one-day TCO3 fluctuation, the following metrics for the ozone changes are calculated: standard deviation, frequency of exceeding two arbitrarily selected thresholds (10% and 20% for the absolute value of one-day TCO3 fluctuation), and extremes (minimum and maximum value). Both ground-based and ERA5 data provide similar mean values for these metrics in the period 1980–2020. Statistically significant trends in the metrics are only calculated for ∼10% and ∼5% of cases using the ground-based and ERA5 data, respectively. There are both negative and positive trends in the stations’ metrics, which make it impossible to find a common direction of changes. Trends in time series averaging the metrics of individual stations indicate a decreasing spread of one-day TCO3 fluctuations in summer seasons using the ground-based data but this is not found in ERA5 data.

In this intense dynamical context, several water masses with thermohaline characteristics of different origins are advected, mixed, and stirred at the surface and at depth. The EUREC4A-OA/ATOMIC experiment that took place in January and February 2020 was dedicated to assessing the processes at play in this region, especially the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere. For that reason, four oceanographic vessels and different autonomous platforms measured properties near the air–sea interface and acquired thousands of upper-ocean (up to 400–2000 m depth) profiles. However, each device had its own observing capability, varying from deep measurements acquired during vessel stations to shipboard underway near-surface observations and measurements from autonomous and uncrewed systems (such as Saildrones). These observations were undertaken with a specific sampling strategy guided by near-real-time satellite maps and adapted every half day, based on the process that was investigated. These processes were characterized by different spatiotemporal scales, from mesoscale eddies, with diameters exceeding 100 km, to submesoscale filaments of 1 km width. This article describes the datasets gathered from the different devices and how the data were calibrated and validated. In order to ensure an overall consistency, the platforms' datasets are cross-validated using a hierarchy of instruments defined by their own specificity and calibration procedures. This has enabled the quantification of the uncertainty in the measured parameters when different datasets are used together, e.g., https://doi.org/10.17882/92071 (L'Hégaret et al., 2020a)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709445878c28a0473b9529"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1801-1830","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6454b941409707605d5b5a99","6454b941409707605d5b5a9a","6454b941409707605d5b5a9b","6454b941409707605d5b5a9c","5e709445878c28a0473b9529","6454b941409707605d5b5a9d","6454b941409707605d5b5a9e","6454b941409707605d5b5a9f","6454b941409707605d5b5aa0","6454b941409707605d5b5aa1","6454b941409707605d5b5aa2","6454b941409707605d5b5aa3","6454b941409707605d5b5aa4","6454b941409707605d5b5aa5","6454b941409707605d5b5aa6","6454b941409707605d5b5aa7","6454b941409707605d5b5aa8","6454b941409707605d5b5aa9","6454b941409707605d5b5aaa","6454b941409707605d5b5aab"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779dc","mniswId":"5272","title":"Earth System Science Data","issn":"1866-3508","eissn":"1866-3516","documentHash":"201c2399-6075-49c3-a1ba-6c5b25dadeef"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6454b941409707605d5b5a98","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"4","documentHash":"3a86fcb4-483a-4f8f-8e92-e9ac56d3ef31"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058770623"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646e109a40970770404f5fdc","name":"Stéphane","lastName":"Operto","documentHash":"16fd5aee-88ae-44de-8666-1eb2381bd56f"},{"objectId":"646e109a40970770404f5fdb","name":"Hossein S.","lastName":"Aghamiry","documentHash":"70bcc0ff-8171-4a7e-bb96-87437bf016dd"},{"objectId":"626c9f287523406b88d07165","name":"Ali","lastName":"Gholami","uuid":"2ECFC5AEAA28B4DAD17F4C5C0367B433AF78932977245DE38DB09A380B3BFA2863C72FB1FB8D83DF61D772FF31E66FC0BF8B853605CF814E843959FE40EB305B","documentHash":"244d54a5-c672-476b-ae86-a8fdf8a92e8d"}],"objectId":"646e109a40970770404f5fd9","doi":"10.1190/geo2022-0343.1","publicUri":"https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2022-0343.1","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Multiplier waveform inversion: A reduced-space full-waveform inversion by the method of multipliers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a nonlinear optimization problem that addresses the estimation of subsurface model parameters by matching the predicted to the observed seismograms. We formulate FWI as a constrained optimization problem in which the regularization term is minimized subject to the nonlinear data matching constraints. Unlike standard FWI, which solves this regularized problem with a penalty method, we use an augmented Lagrangian formulation in the framework of the method of multipliers (MM). This leads to a two-step recursive algorithm, which is called multiplier waveform inversion (MWI). First, the primal step solves an unconstrained minimization problem, which is similar to the standard FWI but with a modified data term. These modified data are obtained by adding the Lagrange multipliers to the data residuals of the classical FWI. Then, the dual step updates the Lagrange multipliers with basic gradient ascent steps. In this framework, they reduce to the running sum of the data residuals of the previous iterations. The performance of the overall algorithm is improved by considering that the MM does not require the exact solution of the primal step at each iteration. In fact, convergence is attained when the primal subproblem is solved with one (without an inner loop) iteration of a gradient-based method at each iteration of the MWI. The new algorithm can be easily implemented in existing FWI codes without computational overhead by adding the Lagrange multipliers to the data residuals at each iteration. We find with numerical examples that MWI has a faster convergence speed and much improved stability compared with FWI and can converge to an accurate solution of the inverse problem in the absence of low-frequency data, even with a constant step size."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["626c9f287523406b88d07165"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"88","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"R339-R354","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["626c9f287523406b88d07165","646e109a40970770404f5fdb","646e109a40970770404f5fdc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e1e","mniswId":"7141","title":"GEOPHYSICS","issn":"0016-8033","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"db5aaaff-2c91-48bc-9aac-f0e0378295ca"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646e109a40970770404f5fda","year":"2023","volume":"88","number":"3","documentHash":"a8287908-e6f6-4ca2-b734-f6de829e5389"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058785715"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b","name":"Beata","lastName":"Górka-Kostrubiec","uuid":"837CE8D75E0ECD3E327460670495F33AD004F18316960AEE744DCB63710EB639069A5F2B1240E8B20E21AC170FC616C7D7E9D246798C609ADE31FA8E049F61DF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6337-7583","documentHash":"2b3d8aa3-c2a8-4bd0-a8fa-dd1830c1e138"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3d37","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dudzisz","uuid":"CB8A56D218873215B0E6A697AEF6BDB67E77A2E5004D09D5FE340B63B5E950B6C9AC075B91A33D58B125890908C1F1302B868364040EFD8E73C894FB75E36692","orcidId":"0000-0002-2503-451X","documentHash":"4b3ca7e2-cc85-4331-9dd3-51c0a79c35b6"}],"objectId":"646e066c40970770404e3437","doi":"10.1007/s11600-022-01005-0","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11600-022-01005-0.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Effect of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on air pollution at a local scale in urban areas affected by high-intensity vehicle traffic in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The lockdown in 2020 implemented due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in a significant improvement in air quality at a global scale. Nationwide lockdown also considerably improved air quality at a local scale, especially in cities which were almost completely shut down during the first coronavirus wave, with nearly no activity. We tested the hypothesis that a reduction in the intensity of vehicle traffic causes a drastic decrease in urban air pollution at a local scale. We focused on two urban agglomerations, Warsaw and Cracow, in Poland. Data of the concentrations of traffic-related sources, namely NOx, PM10, and PM2.5, obtained from two air pollution monitoring stations were analyzed for the years 2020 and 2021, during which lockdown and pandemic restrictions were in effect, and for 2019, as a reference. In the years 2020–2021, the average annual concentration of NOx was decreased by ~ 19%, PM2.5 by ~ 19%, and PM10 by ~ 18% in Warsaw, while in Cracow the average annual concentration of NOx was decreased by ~ 16%, PM2.5 by ~ 22%, and PM10 by ~ 2%, compared to 2019. The contribution from traffic-related sources to the overall level of air pollution was estimated. The results indicated that ~ 30 µg/m3 of PM10, ~ 15 µg/m3 of PM2.5, and ~ 120 µg/m3 of NOx in Cracow, and ~ 20 µg/m3 of PM2.5 in Warsaw originate from moving vehicles. The nationwide lockdown allowed us to conduct this study to understand how a reduction in local traffic emissions can decrease ambient air pollution levels."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3d37","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"71","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"1085-1097","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b","5e709328878c28a0473a3d37"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e09","mniswId":"215","title":"Acta Geophysica","issn":"1895-7455","eissn":"1895-7455","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"020c90c9-42d9-4cda-b1e1-55d7af1c9363"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646e066c40970770404e3438","year":"2023","volume":"71","number":"2","documentHash":"91b5477e-2166-4ed4-9ead-a94b428a2a61"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Traffic-related pollution Lockdown Nitrogen oxides Particulate matter Warsaw Cracow Poland"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058785721"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094e7878c28a0473c668b","name":"Brij","lastName":"Singh","uuid":"7C247FAC360488F5441A6E75E108F332B9CD2FE597AEEDC66A0E242FA709D26C2BD9AAC29BD58EC8E0F526338E28B0615C2575F9B0AD8E83992A945669FC9139","orcidId":"0000-0002-4995-2542","documentHash":"d81f192a-9e5e-41dc-a962-81fbc45d83a7"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","name":"Michał","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":"E022BA94789D74D23E41FED253EBD1E58BB96F3392CDEC6D0E204CD5AD5BB297E9ACB8770CC1CF4EBC30E32E3D816EE170453CA93CA7EA60A329F728C6E29B7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7190-3683","documentHash":"350c51a6-178b-45f0-ba79-d8fde881460e"}],"objectId":"646e0f2e40970770404f2cd4","doi":"10.3390/min13020264","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/13/2/264/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Seismic Imaging of Mineral Exploration Targets: Evaluation of Ray- vs. Wave-Equation-Based Pre-Stack Depth Migrations for Crooked 2D Profiles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Seismic imaging is now a well-established method in mineral exploration with many successful case studies.

Upon comparing the three\ndifferent migrations against available geological data and models, it appeared that CM provided the\nleast noisy and well-focused image, but failed to image the internal reflectivity of the Kylylahti formation.

Here, we consider a Cartesian model of an equatorial region incorporating all the physical ingredients necessary to study their competition. We investigate the linear instability to interchange (\"axisymmetric\") modes of an inviscid, perfectly conducting, isothermal gas, including the effects of rotation, velocity shear, and poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields. The stability problem can be reduced to a second-order boundary value problem, with the growth rate as the eigenvalue. We can make analytic progress through consideration of the physically relevant regime in which the transverse horizontal wavenumber k ≫ 1. Via a perturbation analysis, with 1/k as the small parameter, we can derive the growth rate and the spatial dependence of the eigenfunctions: the unstable modes are strongly localized in the vertical direction, being either wall modes (localized near a boundary of the domain) or body modes (localized in the interior). We describe the conditions under which the joint action of the separate instability mechanisms leads to enhancement or suppression of the instability. Our analytical results are supplemented by numerical solutions of the stability problem. The most unstable mode found analytically is typically in excellent agreement with that found numerically through consideration of a wide range of wavenumbers. Finally, we discuss how our results relate to the solar tachocline."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927e878c28a047396b20"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"267","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"48","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64de0dd14097071ff2b04736","64de0dd14097071ff2b04737","5e70927e878c28a047396b20"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547723d","mniswId":"1992","title":"Astrophysical Journal.

The temperature and precipitation indices were based on percentiles of the variables calculated for a population of daily values from the climate normals for 1981–2010. A greater share of both cyclonic and anticyclonic circulations from the S and SW sectors, forcing the advection of warm air masses from the south, was decisive for the trends of change in comparison with the long-term mean. Both extreme precipitation and drought events depend on the 500 hPa geopotential height and precipitable water anomalies, determined by the baric field over the North Atlantic.

It also helps in the explanation of how this natural gas escapes to the sea bottom. Amplitude-vs-offset (AVO) analysis proved free gas existence in the potential Upper Triassic reservoir, and helped locate free gas deposits within sediments. Hydro-acoustic data illustrated the gas chimneys’ anomalies and the corresponding free gas accumulation in Pleistocene to Quaternary successions. Leaking of gas to the seafloor was also proved by the exposure of pockmarks on multibeam (bathymetry) data at the seafloor.

New devices were installed at the observatory: reference three-component  fluxgate  magnetometer  LEMI-025,  one-component  Mag-01H  Fluxgate  Declinometer/Inclinometer  with  non-magnetic Wild T1 Theodolite (DI-magnetometer), and scalar Overhauser magnetometers GSM-19 and GSM-90. These devices have a high resolution and can carry out measurements with greater accuracy. Also, new methods of absolute observa-tions and variation processing were introduced. In 2022, a new DI-magnetometer was installed; it practically did not change thebaseline values of the variometer LEMI-025 compared to previous years, which indicates the reliability of the results, but made observations much more convenient. We present the results of processing absolute observations, carried out by different meth-ods. Different techniques of calculating these observations are described, and certain shortcomings or inaccuracies in their ap-plication are noted. Recommendations to eliminate the identified shortcomings are proposed. The results of processing of ab-solute observations by different techniques are compared and the reason for the inconsistency of certain values is found. A new method of calculation of absolute observations is proposed, which was used at the observatory, which showed quite good results.In the new methodology, the calculation of errors of the DI-magnetometer, namely: the zero offset of the magnetic sensor, the azimuth collimation error δ and the elevation collimation error ε of its sensitivity axis relative to the axes of theodolite, is initi-ated. Analysis of these errors allows identifying and sometimes correcting the errors in absolute measurements. The installation of new devices and the application of new calculation methods made it possible to ensure better data quality and convenience ofmeasurements at the station, to automate the data processing, preparation, and minimizing the influence of the human factor."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709451878c28a0473ba609"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"2","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ba60e04097070998dce00d","64ba60e04097070998dce00e","5e709451878c28a0473ba609","64ba60e04097070998dce00f","64ba60e04097070998dce010"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e717c9046e0fb0001cf9fb1","title":"Ukrainian Antarctic Journal","issn":"1727-7485","documentHash":"a364e9b5-e3d5-452e-9681-2cad566f6001"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64ba60e04097070998dce00c","year":"2022","volume":"20","number":"2","documentHash":"e05b606a-5131-4fb1-891c-e274e2147534"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["absolute observations, declination, geomagnetic observatory, inclination"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058865574"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64c274d24097071bd6b74109","name":"Z.","lastName":"Gil","documentHash":"8195c458-1b53-46b3-b6e3-5f7fd44e5ea7"},{"objectId":"64c274d24097071bd6b74108","name":"J.","lastName":"Gancarski","documentHash":"08fe168a-b01b-417f-bdfe-1c6644a3a50b"},{"objectId":"64c274d24097071bd6b74107","name":"M.","lastName":"Łanczont","documentHash":"eb61cdf2-a2d3-4875-861d-fc965510c62c"},{"objectId":"64c274d24097071bd6b74106","name":"M.","lastName":"Chadima","documentHash":"b847b4ab-84ca-486f-b4a8-a198743ab6f4"},{"objectId":"64c274d24097071bd6b74105","name":"K.","lastName":"Standzikowski","documentHash":"d431852b-8f18-4927-bfae-41ed60019c20"},{"objectId":"64c274d24097071bd6b74104","name":"J.","lastName":"Nawrocki","documentHash":"53073d7c-e194-4ef4-ad67-1393aee9974c"},{"objectId":"5e7094b2878c28a0473c1bfc","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Werner","uuid":"1F27D2B1BA8431CCEDF36918E3D757ADE4955CA5C2147C9B4FA5BB12222B01FECCAC3BAAA195B29443685106244471C827EFBD78FF7BB453D6358B3A86BB9CE4","orcidId":"0000-0002-7980-0646","documentHash":"e935c9c8-2ba9-40bd-94d5-699f7d20c09d"}],"objectId":"64c274d24097071bd6b74102","doi":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2023.104122","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2352409X23002973?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Archaeomagnetic studies of bricks from ancient buildings sampled in SE Poland (Central Europe)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Brick samples for archaeomagnetic studies were collected from 25 historical buildings constructed between 1235 CE and 1790 CE in SE Poland.

Seasonal and year-to-year variations in terminus position act on all tidewater glaciers, but the key controls on those changes vary from region to region. Here, we examined seasonal and decadal changes in termini positions of seven tidewater glaciers in the inner part of Hornsund, the southernmost fjord of Spitsbergen (Svalbard Archipelago), based on a variety of data from 1992 to 2020. Combining satellite imagery, basic meteorological data (air temperature, positive degree day index (PDD), liquid precipitation), sea surface temperature (SST), mean temperature in the glacier forefield bays, fast sea ice cover, and bathymetry near the glacier front, we examined the influence of potential controlling parameters on interannual and seasonal variability of the glacier termini. We found regional synchrony between terminus advance/retreat and climate variables. At a regional scale, annual fluctuation changes are related to PDD and SST, while summer fluctuations are linked to PDD, although individual glaciers are shown to have differing sensitivities to potential climate drivers. We also found that the retreat period in Hornsund generally lasts from June to October-December. Onset of the retreat is related to sea and air temperature, and in some cases follows the disappearance of the ice cover. These results indicate that the expected increase in meltwater runoff in Svalbard, the input of relatively warm Atlantic water to the fjord, and the increasing trend of longer summer and warmer winter periods will have implications for glacier velocity and frontal ablation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk

Poland, it is necessary to mobilize the geophysical environment. One of the main causes of the crisis in the popularity of this field of study are changes in the economic paradigm, in which an important determinant and goal of activities is the declared departure from fossil fuels, especially coal and oil. Obviously, this has a direct impact on the prospects of geophysical research, whose main contractor on a global scale is the oil industry. With the depletion of the best available deposits, there is a need to reach for deposits that were increasingly difficult to discover and exploit, which contributed to the progress in geophysical research methods that followed the development of technology and information methods – the basis of modern geophysical analyses. The announced definitive departure from fossil fuels coincided in Poland with the end of the shale-gas boom and the announcement of the program of resigning from coal mining. These announcements aroused the belief that the demand for geophysical research will also expire in the coming years together with the prospects for financing such research. However, this belief is wrong. A significant stream of funds will be directed at the development of geophysical research on a global scale, and the current sponsors of utilitarian geophysical research will occupy new niches on the market, e.g. in the accumulation of energy, storage of greenhouse gases and the search for raw materials, the lack of which is increasingly felt by the most developed economies. Along with the growing awareness of the deepening climate crisis and the destruction of the natural environment engulfing the planet, the need increases to recalculate the environmental costs of economic activity, in which broadly understood geophysical sciences can undoubtedly help. Geophysical analysis of huge datasets requires modern computational methods such as numerical modelling, machine learning and artificial intelligence. The development of these fields will therefore be necessary, but also a difficult challenge for the scientific community in Poland. In this work, we will indicate mainly the prospective areas of the economy and the science, related to the broadly understood energy transformation that requires a significant share of geophysical research. The review of the issues and methodology of current geophysical problems and proposed solutions has been arranged in accordance with the directions of research in the field of earth sciences, subjectively highlighting the tasks that seem to be the most promising and/or scientifically attractive. The text deals with the issues related to climatology, hydrology and hydrogeology, environment, geological hazards, renewable and non-renewable energy sources, waste storage, energy storage, critical raw materials, and the structure and physical condition of the Earth’s crust."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","5e709439878c28a0473b875d","5e7093b2878c28a0473af53a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934a878c28a0473a6a0b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"70","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"418–429","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70934a878c28a0473a6a0b","5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","5e709313878c28a0473a2702","5e7093b2878c28a0473af53a","5e709439878c28a0473b875d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a36c","mniswId":"25759","title":"Przegląd Geologiczny","issn":"0033-2151","eissn":"2299-002x","websiteLink":"http://www.pgi.gov.pl/oferta-inst/wydawnictwa/czasopisma/przeglad-geologiczny.html","documentHash":"e211009f-fd45-4550-92f4-ba485a1b6af3"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058915681"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61bd55b87523404d4a8fb735","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Świrad","uuid":"118C55086299242EB0FE154506AB4D2F71EA2D033D3C766F63142F846E784403975854F4974BA2A8C8AA0C22B7830DC2A10A25BE58A31FFB5418A873809D8C09","documentHash":"15dc3d29-c743-41f9-8cf3-4fdaeafd5cd5"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af532","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Moskalik","uuid":"7089D643B2594CC57D59DE2700FC187DBB9C4D62E0328B409B12232373FF164ED96D4B648D07CC92EF366549051735987A73E346A7B7CAB38ED8A2FACEA2C173","orcidId":"0000-0002-0615-9528","documentHash":"312a8722-20f8-4f71-88a9-6b2d058d4efe"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393766","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Herman","uuid":"44B5293D87B2EFB8CF355798E377F5251631920D04E7A3E09EDA286CBD683C0530A7B5ED2F5BD7717F072D01EA9C58EA8281064069FF24ECECBD141524BB57A2","orcidId":"0000-0001-5112-7165","documentHash":"d2114a83-e13a-4055-b93a-e52ed09a78ec"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"652fb7874097077f8aa8083a","doi":"10.5194/essd-15-2623-2023","publicUri":"https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2623/2023/essd-15-2623-2023.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Wind wave and water level dataset for Hornsund, Svalbard (2013–2021)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Underwater pressure sensors were deployed near-continuously at various locations of the nearshore\n(8–23 m depth) Hornsund fjord, Svalbard, between July 2013 and February 2021.

measurements for the quality control of repairing operations (i.e., injections) on marble blocks. For the experimental activities, we used one of the preferred repairing fillers (epoxy resin) and some blocks from one of the world’s most famous marble production area (Carrara quarries in Italy). The selected blocks were paired in a laboratory by overlapping one over the other after inserting very thin spacers in order to simulate air-filled fractures. Fractures were investigated with a 3 GHz ground-penetrating radar (GPR) before and after the resin injections to measure the amplitude reduction expected when the resin substitutes the air. The results were compared with theoretical predictions based on the reflection coefficient predicted according to the thin bed theory. A field test was also performed on a naturally fractured marble block selected along the Carrara shore. Both laboratory and field tests validate the GPR as an effective tool for the quality control of resin injections, provided that measurements include proper calibration tests to control the amplitude instabilities and drift effects of the GPR equipment. The method is accurate enough to distinguish the unfilled fractures from the partially filled fractures and from the totally filled fractures. An automatic algorithm was developed and successfully tested for the rapid quantitative analysis of the time-lapse GPR profiles collected before and after the injections. The whole procedure is mature enough to be proposed to the marble industry to improve the effectiveness of repair interventions and to reduce the waste of natural stone reserves."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

records often take citizens and experts by surprise, resulting in extremely severe damage and loss of life. Existing methods based on local and regional information rarely go beyond national borders and cannot predict these floods well because of limited data on megafloods, and because flood generation processes of extremes differ from those of smaller, more frequently observed events. Here we analyse river discharge observations from over 8,000 gauging stations across Europe and show that recent megafloods could have been anticipated from those previously observed in other places in Europe. Almost all observed megafloods (95.5%) fall within the envelope values estimated from previous floods in other similar places on the continent, implying that local surprises are not surprising at the continental scale. This holds also for older events, indicating that megafloods have not changed much in time relative to their spatial variability. The underlying concept of the study is that catchments with similar flood generation processes produce similar outliers. It is thus essential to transcend national boundaries and learn from other places across the continent to avoid surprises and save lives."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"982-988","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["654c997a40970739eee624bd","654c997a40970739eee624be","654c997a40970739eee624bf","654c997a40970739eee624c0","654c997a40970739eee624c1","654c997a40970739eee624c2","654c997a40970739eee624c3","654c997a40970739eee624c4","654c997a40970739eee624c5","654c997a40970739eee624c6","654c997a40970739eee624c7","654c997a40970739eee624c8","654c997a40970739eee624c9","654c997a40970739eee624ca","654c997a40970739eee624cb","654c997a40970739eee624cc","654c997a40970739eee624cd","654c997a40970739eee624ce","654c997a40970739eee624cf","654c997a40970739eee624d0","654c997a40970739eee624d1","654c997a40970739eee624d2","654c997a40970739eee624d3","654c997a40970739eee624d4","654c997a40970739eee624d5","654c997a40970739eee624d6","654c997a40970739eee624d7","654c997a40970739eee624d8","654c997a40970739eee624d9","654c997a40970739eee624da","654c997a40970739eee624db","654c997a40970739eee624dc","654c997a40970739eee624dd","654c997a40970739eee624de","654c997a40970739eee624df","654c997a40970739eee624e0","654c997a40970739eee624e1","654c997a40970739eee624e2","654c997a40970739eee624e3","654c997a40970739eee624e4","654c997a40970739eee624e5","654c997a40970739eee624e6","5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","654c997a40970739eee624e7","654c997a40970739eee624e8","654c997a40970739eee624e9","654c997a40970739eee624ea","654c997a40970739eee624eb","654c997a40970739eee624ec","654c997a40970739eee624ed","654c997a40970739eee624ee","654c997a40970739eee624ef","654c997a40970739eee624f0","654c997a40970739eee624f1","654c997a40970739eee624f2","654c997a40970739eee624f3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f81","mniswId":"14821","title":"Nature Geoscience","issn":"1752-0894","eissn":"1752-0908","documentHash":"b1c553e5-f37a-4e32-b5e1-5bdf05fa0907"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"654c997a40970739eee624bc","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"11","documentHash":"b7084121-81fd-4075-80a9-76a04f2f771e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Hydrology Natural hazards"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059085778"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65796ba34097070701952f85","name":"Monica","lastName":"Sund","documentHash":"bd0a5c13-f382-4cab-b8b3-b9290893ef78"},{"objectId":"65796ba34097070701952f82","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Frydrych","documentHash":"8e1e7cdc-d25e-47f2-bb45-efefd6364e8a"},{"objectId":"65796ba34097070701952f81","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zagórski","documentHash":"ec43db97-d339-4eaa-959c-d84475a5848f"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af532","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Moskalik","uuid":"7089D643B2594CC57D59DE2700FC187DBB9C4D62E0328B409B12232373FF164ED96D4B648D07CC92EF366549051735987A73E346A7B7CAB38ED8A2FACEA2C173","orcidId":"0000-0002-0615-9528","documentHash":"312a8722-20f8-4f71-88a9-6b2d058d4efe"},{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f1d3","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Błaszczyk","uuid":"3D0023AD6153781042ED90FDD2628342B5393F66DEC7700ECBE54A0D313E8277BF75544F9AD51B962158B0226737903EA05C0328AE511014E17DF1DA87B00E16","orcidId":"0000-0002-9702-0440","documentHash":"804b3688-e0db-4979-baf3-dd903a1f624f"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f076","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Jania","uuid":"C5EB10D76EA50D3529F3DC9C2992A8C5F7E2D849C9D7D9F935708AF0DC071EAE0E78B4CC097A628983449DFA5D74AFE7EF77423AC9F51EC4F564270E3363E0FA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8531-7394","documentHash":"4cdf6236-2013-4763-82ca-ac18ab85b8d4"}],"objectId":"65796ba34097070701952f7f","doi":"10.1080/24694452.2023.2200487","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/24694452.2023.2200487","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Surges in Three Svalbard Glaciers Derived from Historic Sources and Geomorphic Features","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Surge-type glaciers in Svalbard are common and have been studied extensively. Whereas active phases of surges were observed and thoroughly investigated recently, data on surges in the past are limited. They are essential, however, to assess the duration of the surge cycle, to determine relation to climatic impulses, and to better understand triggering factors and the mechanism of this phenomenon. Three glaciers located in Recherchefjorden, NW Wedel Jarlsberg Land (Svalbard) were studied because they undergo the same regional climate conditions but differ by the basin’s size and morphology front types. The article employed different types of data, including geomorphological records, cartographic, graphic, and bibliographic sources. These sources permitted the determination of the location of the termini of glaciers and the quantitative and qualitative description of the rate of changes determined with computer analysis and statistical compilation. Such analysis of other data sources enabled the reconstruction of glaciers’ behavior in the past. Glacier surges in the study area correspond with this type of phenomenon in Svalbard. The results obtained showed a certain synchronization of surges in the 1820s and 1830s, the 1880s, the first half of the twentieth century, and particularly the last decade."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af532"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e7878c28a04739f076","5e7092ea878c28a04739f1d3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"113","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1835-1855","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65796ba34097070701952f81","65796ba34097070701952f82","5e7092e7878c28a04739f076","5e7092ea878c28a04739f1d3","65796ba34097070701952f85","5e7093b2878c28a0473af532"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b9a5","mniswId":"1297","title":"Annals of the American Association of Geographers","issn":"2469-4452","eissn":"2469-4460","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"2e8c7836-f93a-4a84-8edd-0148170b33a8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65796ba34097070701952f80","year":"2023","volume":"113","number":"8","documentHash":"bef9ee70-ace5-4017-9403-1e7b1eb78e64"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059128087"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"657ae3a14097071019305221","name":"Luciano","lastName":"Telesca","documentHash":"18311878-bf7e-4d0d-af6e-d1726fb310a0"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba083","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Czechowski","uuid":"976B2A0264185DF857CD5C01AD98E8D626E20E3C1122C6110C5874505B167AC0199768138BC6DF21BA366BD4F6C2B552D9B0D854F3A9DFA1F70C5743B7FD5E91","orcidId":"0000-0002-7806-6726","documentHash":"735452b6-a66f-4d24-93aa-6bea71dd143d"}],"objectId":"657ae3a1409707101930521f","doi":"10.3390/e25121650","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/12/1650/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Fisher–Shannon Investigation of the Effect of Nonlinearity of Discrete Langevin Model on Behavior of Extremes in Generated Time Series","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Diverse forms of nonlinearity within stochastic equations give rise to varying dynamics in processes, which may influence the behavior of extreme values. This study focuses on two nonlinear models of the discrete Langevin equation: one with a fixed diffusion function (M1) and the other with a fixed marginal distribution (M2), both characterized by a nonlinearity parameter. Extremes are defined according to the run theory with thresholds based on percentiles. The behavior of inter-extreme times and run lengths is examined by employing Fisher’s Information Measure and the Shannon Entropy. Our findings reveal a clear relationship between the entropic and informational measures and the nonlinearity of model M1—these measures decrease as the nonlinearity parameter increases. Similar relationships are evident for the M2 model, albeit to a lesser extent, even though the background data’s marginal distribution remains unaffected by this parameter. As thresholds increase, both the values of Fisher’s Information Measure and the Shannon Entropy also increase."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

are characterized as time-space clustered sequences of earthquakes without a dominating strong event. The occurrence of earthquake swarms has been observed in various environments and found out to be closely related to underground migration of fluids. Mechanical interactions between fluid-conduit properties of fault and rupture determine the spatio-temporal complexity of rupturing process and earthquake occurrence. Often, seismic swarms are triggered by Water Reservoir Impoundment (WRI). Although many studies have investigated the relationship between the pore pressure changes due to WRI and observed seismicity, hydromechanical models that explain the observed processes are limited. Here, we investigate the role of hydromechanical interactions in triggering earthquake swarms in WRI conditions, using data from the Song Tranh 2 Reservoir in Vietnam as an example. We found that seismic swarms evolve due to stress redistribution and subsequent induced fluid flow. Swarm sequences form interconnected rupture increments and their aggregated behaviour is similar to a single large earthquake that ruptures the fault segment at once. The evolution of friction with the mean slip retrieved from the swarm earthquakes exhibits both, slip weakening and strengthening stages, resembling linear slip-weakening friction. The effective slip over which the weakening is completed, is modulated by the pore pressure diffusion. These results provide insights into the physical mechanisms of seismic swarms and have implications for seismic hazard."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af539","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4621","5e70927e878c28a047396b20","5e70938d878c28a0473ac8f6","5e7093b5878c28a0473af7f3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"863","pagesFromTo":"230005","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af539","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4621","5e70938d878c28a0473ac8f6","5e7093b5878c28a0473af7f3","5e70927e878c28a047396b20"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798ea","mniswId":"19321","title":"Tectonophysics","issn":"0040-1951","eissn":"1879-3266","documentHash":"62e6a275-21a6-4058-b639-1958cb19c4d2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6580202f4097073e4d1f0012","year":"2023","volume":"863","documentHash":"b2d4a12f-80e9-4015-997f-c7d1dd820d3f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Seismic swarmsReservoir impoundment triggered seismicityIntermittent rupture"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059150068"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6584124b4097075aba66d979","name":"Lars E.","lastName":"AUGLAND","documentHash":"edca19b2-d442-492e-8654-638336d2a2a2"},{"objectId":"6584124b4097075aba66d978","name":"Simon A.","lastName":"WILDE","documentHash":"24eeabc2-a016-448c-ab70-a4731da96fdd"},{"objectId":"6584124b4097075aba66d977","name":"Martin J.","lastName":"WHITEHOUSE","documentHash":"678f82ab-ec66-4799-b042-23e0b35c816b"},{"objectId":"60c34e209543c7233654446b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Król","uuid":"F4CCDC504FCB9988A35A2DC262A795C3DEA9736446D61ABB46DF7E9A2334F5DEBE16EEE8D2D50E35415FE15A6047E93CA0819AB82CE697F4C27085E81ECD5E94","documentHash":"2be8b182-8b34-4168-aa9a-02405d831f37"},{"objectId":"5f5b4028752340073806a9b5","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Dunkley","uuid":"940993469313C143C462EBEBE867F79D6863EFBDE1331E198532EF8D68AC43FB8904B76E77D6AA9CE7E4FEEA534C939BACA51E20A70301995B30B64FB435B839","documentHash":"79aab392-a25b-460c-9588-595aadb97e78"},{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kusiak","uuid":"3052A19F570F1180C90FE5ED9510A53FCEA3A401B154BB701C443A248D410748C9CFEB65CF60BA418E2ECBD9AAFA204B99C32FF77545357BEC09625DF52F2ECD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2042-8621","documentHash":"10e63152-d296-4f9a-9487-cad0a39065f2"}],"objectId":"6584124b4097075aba66d975","doi":"10.2465/jmps.230419","publicUri":"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmps/118/ANTARCTICA/118_230419/_pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The record of geological processes in zircon from polymetamorphosed orthogneisses from the Napier Mountains, Napier Complex, East Antarctica","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Napier Complex in Enderby Land and western Kemp Land is a unique component of the East Antarctic\nShield because it records a timeline of crustal growth from the Eo– to Neoarchean.

They\nrecord metamorphic growth, recrystallization, and modification of zircon at 2800–2770, 2740–2720, and\n2490–2460 Ma. For the first time, fluid–related alteration at around 2730 Ma is evident in a granitic gneiss\nfrom Grimsley Peaks. At the similar time, dioritic gneiss was formed at Mount Marr. Tonalitic and granitic\ngneisses from Grimsley Peaks yield protolith crystallization ages of around 3210 and 2825 Ma, respectively.\nThe generation of granitic gneiss was coeval with ~ 2.8 Ga metamorphism in the area. These new data from this\nlittle–known part of the complex provide a better understanding of the crustal evolution of the Napier Complex"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c34e209543c7233654446b","5f5b4028752340073806a9b5","5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"118","issue":"ANTARCTICA","pagesFromTo":"n/a","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c34e209543c7233654446b","5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6","5f5b4028752340073806a9b5","6584124b4097075aba66d977","6584124b4097075aba66d978","6584124b4097075aba66d979"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478896","mniswId":"11878","title":"Journal of Mineralogical and Petrological Sciences","issn":"1345-6296","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"7cdc298b-e769-438d-940f-97632930f5cd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6584124b4097075aba66d976","year":"2023","volume":"118","number":"ANTARCTICA","documentHash":"337cf0d8-ae1e-4b91-b794-785af1e7f5cb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Archean, Napier Complex, Zircon, U–Pb geochronology, Polymetamorphism"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059166653"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b78fc","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Mrokowska","uuid":"636A3DA215291C1A0EA508E0E58EB0F691CFAD76743086AB5B5EFE99C0F4E04721F2A9A94FF6280DA2B9FD763F37A8656FF39E02ACCEBEE7158E85350635DCEB","orcidId":"0000-0002-3135-7315","documentHash":"7312b744-ebc7-41f4-960c-40ab6a6faddd"},{"objectId":"5e709327878c28a0473a3c39","name":"Anna","lastName":"Krztoń-Maziopa","uuid":"EC0454313F9B467159026149FF2BDF327C23D941999CCA426D59E1514B86EAE6B67FA9FDDE711263F80676145B58815ED47E8097F59F98256D4B0F2322095CD8","orcidId":"0000-0002-0223-0614","documentHash":"9df68760-3b55-44b7-b98e-3382f7eca027"}],"objectId":"6594116f40970739462f1c1d","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168767","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969723073953","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Settling of microplastics in mucus-rich water column: the role of biologically modified rheology of seawater","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Non-buoyant microplastics (MPs) sink through the marine water column, adversely affecting the ecosystem. The manner in which MPs influence the water environment depends to a large extent on their settling dynamics, driven by their properties and the physio-chemical characteristics of water column. However, some properties of seawater remain elusive, limiting our ability to fully explain the sinking processes of MPs. One of the gaps in our understanding relates to the elevated content of exopolymers (EPSs) secreted by algae and bacteria, which locally transform seawater into a non-Newtonian liquid, altering the hydrodynamics of particle transport. In this study, we present a series of lab-scale experiments on the dynamics of isometric (spheres and irregular particles) and anisometric (disks, rods, and blades) MPs settling in artificial seawater with the addition of polysaccharides. We find that upon the appearance of EPSs in seawater, the sinking velocity of MPs diminishes and may fluctuate, the orientation pattern changes in a non-intuitive way, and MPs may tumble. As measured in rheological tests, these consequences result from seawater gaining viscoelastic and shear-thinning properties. Our findings raise concerns that mucus-rich seawater may favor the aggregation of MPs with organic matter, interaction with biota, and biofouling, which can affect the biogeochemistry of the marine ecosystem. Based on these findings, we recommend that seawater rheology, modified by excessive amounts of EPSs during algal blooms, should be considered in biogeochemical and microplastic transport models."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942c878c28a0473b78fc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"912","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709327878c28a0473a3c39","5e70942c878c28a0473b78fc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"59516ca8-3554-4f06-a1d4-f330ee71985e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059214553"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6596adc94097074a3905825a","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Owoc","documentHash":"17d9d282-3857-4a33-b26d-08a3dbcefa41"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c990","name":"Artur","lastName":"Marciniak","uuid":"5218C630BD00E1D15FDE8DD95D286784DA876E0E8000313F823180BBF748D7DC9F0A8023A1F90AFE9C5AD5782E365D07C763275DF0F9E05D63FA3DF6DD9BDA9E","documentHash":"64902d05-2f25-441a-b4b1-d9cdb1529f5c"},{"objectId":"5e70941b878c28a0473b64e7","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Cader","uuid":"7A38BACB7C777A9FADAF1B8A68B4970B5BA80DDBD4CCF0EBE9C16D0471F10548EAD4DB87DA7AD4FF6805807ADD408A3D47A34577732E4889FC06FDF221763A72","orcidId":"0000-0001-5236-3223","documentHash":"2eaf5dab-c065-43aa-a84e-077e7560eecc"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Majdański","uuid":"89D7E80830B607723CEFEDCFBDA5FC52ECA8EFD548784730711C4D8752516F3FD892A2BCEDA865B4737074B27716938ACD71EC45855B87BECB169C65C89CD172","orcidId":"0000-0002-8909-4407","documentHash":"0b6165bd-7e9b-4ab0-9954-9e96b9ceabf6"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f06b","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Dobiński","uuid":"A73C6E5AB3408580C89A8EA6D95F03AEE6B7B55854A5B76E1EB8D352644B6BC5225EADDF3C51AAC567468CB6AB1B5AF0AF518065B94C8FAA4B28029BE06DCAA6","orcidId":"0000-0002-6249-7273","documentHash":"c4de0425-1f96-495d-9313-e7f2b286b757"}],"objectId":"6596adc94097074a39058256","doi":"10.1016/j.catena.2023.107689","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0341816223007804","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The hypothesis of the shape of the permafrost in Hornsund, Spitsbergen and the potential impact of its degradation on the Arctic","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The areas covered by permafrost in the polar regions are vulnerable to rapid changes in the current climate. The well-studied near-surface active layer and permafrost zone are in contrast to the unknown exact shape of the bottom permafrost boundary. Therefore, the entire shape of permafrost between the upper and lower boundaries is not identified with sufficient accuracy. Since most of the factors affecting deep cryotic structures are subsurface in nature, their evolution in deeper layers is also relatively unclear. Here, we propose a hypothesis based on the results of geophysical studies regarding the shape of the permafrost in the coastal area of Svalbard, Southern Spitsbergen. In the article, we emphasize the importance of recognizing not only the uppermost active layer but also the bottom boundary of permafrost along with its transition zone, due to the underestimated potential role of its continuity in observing climate change. The lower permafrost boundary is estimated to range from 70 m below the surface in areas close to the shore to 180 m inland, while a continuous layer of an entirely frozen matrix can be identified with a thickness between 40 m and 100 m. We also hypothesized the presence of the possible subsea permafrost in the Hornsund. The influence of seawater intrusions, isostatic uplift of deglaciated areas, and surface-related processes that affect permafrost evolution may lead to extensive changes in the hydrology and geology of the polar regions in the future. For all these reasons, monitoring, geophysical imaging and understanding the characteristics and evolution of deep permafrost structures requires global attention and scientific efforts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e7878c28a04739f06b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c990","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737e9d9","uid":"bnin_CfrOxQK6XxaYJytRhg","uuid":"3178cdc9-4bfd-44e5-a0dc-d37b30326a58","name":"Instytut Gospodarki Surowcami Mineralnymi i Energią Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70941b878c28a0473b64e7"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9d9","parentUuid":"3178cdc9-4bfd-44e5-a0dc-d37b30326a58","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9d9","rootUuid":"3178cdc9-4bfd-44e5-a0dc-d37b30326a58","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"235","pagesFromTo":"1-5","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c796a8752340480571c990","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","5e7092e7878c28a04739f06b","6596adc94097074a3905825a","5e70941b878c28a0473b64e7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477569","mniswId":"3336","title":"CATENA","issn":"0341-8162","eissn":"1872-6887","documentHash":"3113991c-d094-4765-8d86-d17e29bbe75d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6596adc94097074a39058257","year":"2024","volume":"235","documentHash":"a85c4865-f200-4f0c-ba50-1018f6c03b78"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059224679"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa13","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Białecki","uuid":"E3B18B5049E9F50FA8A41D492600C3A9F5AC8FAFA6BB9E429C8F05FE15F84734521C49A5519B3652B04064B398079023DE1DB5BB093B0DF6C86241ED8845A7BE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4970-2268","documentHash":"565edb5c-5bbe-4c6f-b45c-074f2d10f94c"}],"objectId":"65840dc84097075aba669786","doi":"10.3390/math11244953","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/11/24/4953/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Stochastic Process Leading to Catalan Number Recurrence","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Motivated by a simple model of earthquake statistics, a finite random discrete dynamical system is defined in order to obtain Catalan number recurrence by describing the stationary state of the system in the limit of its infinite size.

Evaluating changes in the magnitude of priming as a function of warming, eutrophication, and OM stoichiometry, we incubated sediments with 13C-labeled fresh organic matter (FOM, algal/cyanobacterial) and simulated future climate scenarios (+4°C and +8°C). We investigated FOM-induced production of CH4 and microbial community changes. C loss was primed by up to 17% in dominantly allochthonous sediments (ranging from 5% to 17%), compared to up to 6% in autochthonous sediments (−9% to 6%), suggesting that refractory OM is more susceptible to priming. The magnitude of priming was dependent on sediment OM stoichiometry (C/N ratio), the ratio of fresh labile OM to microbial biomass (FOM/MB), and temperature. Priming was strongest at 4°C when FOM/MB was below 50%. Addition of FOM was associated with activation and growth of bacterial decomposers, including for example, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, or Fibrobacteres, known for their potential to degrade insoluble and complex structural biopolymers. Using sedimentary C/N > 15 as a threshold, we show that in up to 35% of global lakes, sedimentation is dominated by allochthonous rather than autochthonous material. We then provide first-order estimates showing that, upon increase in phytoplankton biomass in these lakes, priming-enabled degradation of recalcitrant OM will release up to 2.1 Tg C annually, which would otherwise be buried for geological times."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60de971e9543c72336544649"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60de971e9543c72336544649","659bd95e4097076e59fff27d","659bd95e4097076e59fff27e","659bd95e4097076e59fff27f","659bd95e4097076e59fff280"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e4f","mniswId":"7245","title":"GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","issn":"1354-1013","eissn":"1365-2486","documentHash":"5c9da737-f24b-45cc-8cf7-b567a143645c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659bd95e4097076e59fff27c","year":"2024","volume":"30","number":"1","documentHash":"ee505c3c-ed47-40a1-80a7-377535ecc54d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059227648"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659ead094097077f7b56c3ad","name":"Alessandra","lastName":"Ribodetti","documentHash":"53e67429-8e72-40db-ad0e-c35076810f1e"},{"objectId":"659ead094097077f7b56c3ac","name":"Laure","lastName":"Combe","documentHash":"85855c15-539d-4816-a189-d737fbcc4a00"},{"objectId":"659ead094097077f7b56c3ab","name":"Frichnel","lastName":"Mamfoumbi","documentHash":"1195f163-5e63-4d43-acc5-ee24f8368b19"},{"objectId":"659ead094097077f7b56c3aa","name":"Kamal","lastName":"Aghazade","documentHash":"dbccc43d-2e49-4e91-8127-adb525649031"},{"objectId":"659ead094097077f7b56c3a9","name":"Stephen","lastName":"Beller","documentHash":"92f93e9f-bd8c-4277-abd1-91e0915e9cf7"},{"objectId":"659ead094097077f7b56c3a8","name":"Gaoshan","lastName":"Guo","documentHash":"0b2e055f-0643-4f9e-82e3-e3209cf414ae"},{"objectId":"659ead094097077f7b56c3a7","name":"Hossein","lastName":"Aghamiry","documentHash":"ae0124ee-4eb0-4d46-a0ea-dda981687dd9"},{"objectId":"659ead094097077f7b56c3a6","name":"Stéphane","lastName":"Operto","documentHash":"fd093860-df2e-4320-8e1c-786e6ca95efe"},{"objectId":"626c9f287523406b88d07165","name":"Ali","lastName":"Gholami","uuid":"2ECFC5AEAA28B4DAD17F4C5C0367B433AF78932977245DE38DB09A380B3BFA2863C72FB1FB8D83DF61D772FF31E66FC0BF8B853605CF814E843959FE40EB305B","documentHash":"244d54a5-c672-476b-ae86-a8fdf8a92e8d"}],"objectId":"659ead094097077f7b56c3a4","doi":"10.1190/geo2022-0758.1","publicUri":"https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2022-0758.1","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Extending the search space of full-waveform inversion beyond the single-scattering Born approximation: A tutorial review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Full-waveform inversion (FWI) can be made immune to cycle skipping by matching the recorded data with traveltime errors smaller than one-half period from inaccurate subsurface models. To achieve this goal, the simulated wavefields can be computed in an extended search space as the solution of an overdetermined problem aimed at jointly satisfying the wave equation and fitting the data in a least-squares sense. This leads to data-assimilated wavefields that are computed by solving the wave equation in the inaccurate background model with a data-dependent source extension added to the source term. Then, the subsurface parameters are updated by canceling out these additional source terms, sometimes inaccurately called wave equation errors, to push the background model toward the true model in the left-side wave equation operator. Although many studies are devoted to these approaches with promising numerical results, their governing physical principles and their relationships with classical FWI do not seem to be understood well yet. The goal of this tutorial is to review these principles in the framework of inverse scattering theory whose governing forward equation is the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. From this equation, we find how the data-assimilated wavefields embed an approximation of the scattered field generated by the sought model perturbation and how they modify the sensitivity kernel of classical FWI beyond the Born approximation. We also clarify how the approximation with which these wavefields approximate the unknown true wavefields is accounted for in the adjoint source and in the full Newton Hessian of the parameter-estimation problem. The theory is finally illustrated with numerical examples. Understanding the physical principles governing these methods is a necessary prerequisite to assess their potential and limits and design relevant heuristics to manage the latter."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["626c9f287523406b88d07165"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"88","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"R671-R702","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659ead094097077f7b56c3a6","626c9f287523406b88d07165","659ead094097077f7b56c3a7","659ead094097077f7b56c3a8","659ead094097077f7b56c3a9","659ead094097077f7b56c3aa","659ead094097077f7b56c3ab","659ead094097077f7b56c3ac","659ead094097077f7b56c3ad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e1e","mniswId":"7141","title":"Geophysics","issn":"0016-8033","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"9b8aa276-85ca-4efc-a130-57b255d99a39"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659ead094097077f7b56c3a5","year":"2023","volume":"88","number":"6","documentHash":"bc7b9d6b-554b-4656-a359-4a484253d482"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059231364"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659e992b4097077f7b54be28","name":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Fu","documentHash":"d0137b8f-b425-44ae-9bf7-487a682db85c"},{"objectId":"659e992b4097077f7b54be27","name":"Yan","lastName":"Ma","documentHash":"61b02bf7-60eb-49fe-b9ca-9788b81f7687"},{"objectId":"659e992b4097077f7b54be26","name":"Naser","lastName":"Golsanami","documentHash":"f51bd559-847f-4b46-9994-222053949d7c"},{"objectId":"659e992b4097077f7b54be25","name":"Atif","lastName":"Ismail","documentHash":"6b4918c8-0916-4606-8401-2c843b313256"},{"objectId":"659e992b4097077f7b54be24","name":"Ghulam Mohyuddin","lastName":"Sohail","documentHash":"7425b780-133f-4ecc-a9c4-efab436a39e5"},{"objectId":"659e992b4097077f7b54be23","name":"Mengdi","lastName":"Sun","documentHash":"a19601e7-7bcc-4d29-bbe7-bf5607e222cf"},{"objectId":"659e992b4097077f7b54be22","name":"Bo","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"0b361870-b7f5-437c-9181-0f6ab6e68c18"},{"objectId":"659e992b4097077f7b54be21","name":"Qamar","lastName":"Yasin","documentHash":"c947c3bb-63ec-43d7-be8b-9c7b571e2c5a"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Majdański","uuid":"89D7E80830B607723CEFEDCFBDA5FC52ECA8EFD548784730711C4D8752516F3FD892A2BCEDA865B4737074B27716938ACD71EC45855B87BECB169C65C89CD172","orcidId":"0000-0002-8909-4407","documentHash":"0b6165bd-7e9b-4ab0-9954-9e96b9ceabf6"}],"objectId":"659e992b4097077f7b54be1f","doi":"10.1016/j.fuel.2023.130161","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0016236123027758?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Automatic pore structure analysis in organic-rich shale using FIB-SEM and attention U-Net","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The pore structure is an important factor in determining the productivity of shale, which can help us make better operational decisions. Shale formations have an extremely complex pore structure with a wide range of pore sizes, shapes, orientations, and connectivity. Advanced imaging techniques, such as focused ion beam scanning electron microscopes (FIB-SEM), contribute significantly to the analysis and understanding of complex pore networks in shale, but they are time-consuming. Developing new methods and techniques to capture the spatial distribution and connectivity of pores at various scales is essential to understanding pore structure and its impact on fluid flow. This study aims to analyze the pore characteristics of shale reservoirs by using artificial intelligence (AI) and FIB-SEM. We applied a novel attention gate (AG) model to FIB-SEM images that automatically learns to focus on target structures of varying pores’ shape and size. AG can be fully incorporated into the U-Net model with minimal computational impact. The AG improved prediction accuracy by making the U-Net model more sensitive to essential features in the input images and achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 71%, and F1 score of 81% at a confidence threshold of 1. Experimental results show that Attention U-Net outperformed in predicting the pore structures in shale samples from Longmaxi Formation, Qingshankou Formation, Cambrian Niutitang Formation, Yanchang shale oil, and Bakken shale while obtaining optimal performance without requiring multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Additionally, Attention U-Net addresses some of the limitations of the Edge-Threshold Automatic Processing (ETAP) method, including the limited ability to obtain a complete description of the pore space as well as the low segmentation accuracy and sensitivity. The proposed workflow offers a promising solution for optimizing the automatic processing of microscopic images for pores and microfractures identification. Researchers and industry professionals can improve their understanding of shale properties and applications in various fields by maximizing the benefits of our workflow."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"358","pagesFromTo":"130161","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659e992b4097077f7b54be21","659e992b4097077f7b54be22","659e992b4097077f7b54be23","659e992b4097077f7b54be24","659e992b4097077f7b54be25","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","659e992b4097077f7b54be26","659e992b4097077f7b54be27","659e992b4097077f7b54be28"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d7a","mniswId":"6898","title":"FUEL","issn":"0016-2361","documentHash":"0ff5c7e0-65e8-4826-b8b2-522236e1b051"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659e992b4097077f7b54be20","year":"2024","volume":"358","documentHash":"b901f7d2-d34d-4016-a8b5-f08fb3fc6b82"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059231442"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6520c2a940e3ff22d3492a99","name":"Tesfaye","lastName":"Senbeta","uuid":"9D85ADEF4C2AD57DB3361EC3CEF72D5C34A18B5B5FF70EF9AC06C673A063E4EF84CEC416D6B93B5D6D20CB579B6101F0FE92A39FDE306DC52FC82F16875889E1","documentHash":"4299ace0-c589-40ee-bdc7-8cfb3cf971a8"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Napiórkowski","uuid":"6AE9EEECF23A9027016CE0A5043569229D6A23680190D0C326173C1E6985FE82CE8B15504F7C20E43EC7B867AD3C2CF79197D909B3D518AC611E0C30D884583C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0273-4193","documentHash":"03e7ee2b-1337-4436-8dc2-d4e7730e5939"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdf","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Karamuz","uuid":"42510623665FE0F9C3E90EFFBE52337DCA2E7F6274643BDAB5CD13591E0EDB68962EF018F363C9A1A8E2C85E685741F5523AFC7B270A7EAEB97A679F3C4E5C7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-7226-7412","documentHash":"3bf44037-d31d-40de-9945-7be966f84232"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","name":"Adam","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"864E3E49A2309C1FB479470AD68682EA3FAB4349A58557B0478C54157BBB2B92E9A4D1252BEC5AB9362F29E198D2892DA7519ED222E344D6630D3217C0FDAF82","orcidId":"0000-0003-0923-7314","documentHash":"25196237-6284-406e-a277-91b7ddef9871"}],"objectId":"659d242340970776646e90fa","doi":"10.1007/s11600-022-00988-0","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11600-022-00988-0.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Calibration of conceptual rainfall-runoff models by selected differential evolution and particle swarm optimization variants","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The performance of conceptual catchment runoff models may highly depend on the specific choice of calibration methods made by the user. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE) are two well-known families of Evolutionary Algorithms that are widely used for calibration of hydrological and environmental models. In the present paper, five DE and five PSO optimization algorithms are compared regarding calibration of two conceptual models, namely the Swedish HBV model (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenavdelning model) and the French GR4J model (modèle du Génie Rural à 4 paramètres Journalier) of the Kamienna catchment runoff. This catchment is located in the middle part of Poland. The main goal of the study was to find out whether DE or PSO algorithms would be better suited for calibration of conceptual rainfall-runoff models. In general, four out of five DE algorithms perform better than four out of five PSO methods, at least for the calibration data. However, one DE algorithm constantly performs very poorly, while one PSO algorithm is among the best optimizers. Large differences are observed between results obtained for calibration and validation data sets. Differences between optimization algorithms are lower for the GR4J than for the HBV model, probably because GR4J has fewer parameters to optimize than HBV."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6520c2a940e3ff22d3492a99","5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdf","5e70942c878c28a0473b7920"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"71","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"2325-2338","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdf","6520c2a940e3ff22d3492a99"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e09","mniswId":"215","title":"Acta Geophysica","issn":"1895-7455","eissn":"1895-7455","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"020c90c9-42d9-4cda-b1e1-55d7af1c9363"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659d242340970776646e90fb","year":"2023","volume":"5","number":"71","documentHash":"38629159-f2e3-4dda-9b03-4fea55313b39"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Conceptual rainfall-runoff models HBV GR4J Particle swarm optimization Differential evolution"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059234605"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a92","name":"Marek","lastName":"Kubicki","uuid":"15EDA68BD9C1472732CD0317D3EF7D3BFA3AC3EE41C45BFC13F4C35F8675441ED6556EA2D104A3F7425A8B72DF4B352EA40F28B73AFFD0CC12F8E6457DB839F4","orcidId":"0000-0001-8664-4939","documentHash":"068c9f41-143a-42cf-9e59-77e068156b94"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b2f","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Sobolewski","uuid":"0AC01E8C29387148284CCDC7B7074B202EE4DD9CBC29AE3B5AF4228508B58A9153AC080DEA82886FFCA6F42BBBF58D1FD2B8A38006B48E4806C05987161E4AA0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5645-1570","documentHash":"7b71fa44-fa83-400f-8cbf-8fa6893e97aa"}],"objectId":"659bfe694097076e5904a820","doi":"10.3390/s23249627","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Simulation Analysis of Sensors with Different Geometry Used in Measurements of Atmospheric Electricity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>The atmospheric electric current, “air–earth current”, flows between the low ionosphere and Earth’s surface.

According to Wilson’s concept of the Earth’s Global Electric Circuit, in the areas of so-called fair weather, based on current measurements at the Earth’s surface, it is possible to conclude the global electrical processes in the ionosphere and higher layers. The theoretical basis for this inference is the law of continuity of electric current or the principle of conservation of electric charge. We present the results of simulations of the distribution of electric field lines for sensors with different geometries placed in a uniform electric field, representing the atmospheric electric field. The sensors are metal surfaces on which electric charges are induced or deposited. In the external measuring circuit to which the sensor is connected, an electric current [A] will flow, related to the air–earth current density [A/m2], but their relationship may be challenging to interpret. We analyze the impact of sensor geometry on the possibility of interpreting the atmospheric electric conduction and atmospheric displacement current based on the current measured in the external circuit. This present method can be used for the geometric construction of new sensors at the stage of determining the electrical characteristics of the sensor (e.g., effective collecting area).

They are obtained from the measurements of geomagnetic variation and carry information on the distribution of local and regional electric resistivity in the subsurface, which can be interpreted in terms of geology and tectonics. The underlying concept of their interpretation works properly if the so-called far-field condition is fulfilled, i.e., if certain assumptions on the geometry of utilized natural electromagnetic source fields are met. The magnetotelluric practitioner expects problems in the regions where the electromagnetic variations originate to a high extent from ionospheric currents as sources. Due to the polar (or auroral) electrojets, this skepticism towards the electromagnetic far-field methods clearly applies to the high latitudes, polar regions, and auroral zones. In the present study, the investigation focuses on the extent to which problems typical for the auroral electrojet sources occur in the geomagnetic variation data from the Argentine Islands INTERMAGNET observatory (AIA) located at the Ukrainian Antarctic Akademik Vernadsky station. Induction vectors from one month of AIA variation data measured in the normal framework of the INTERMAGNET observatory are analysed for their stability over both period and time, where a time resolution of one day allows for the detection of changes originating from the source signals instead of from subsurface resistivity distribution. The outcomes from AIA are compared to the corresponding ones of two northern hemisphere stations which belong to the International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects (IMAGE) network, located in Finland and Poland. Results show that AIA induction vectors do not exhibit the problems expected in the high latitudes; their time stability is very similar to that of stations at a comparable but opposite geomagnetic latitude of 50 degrees, which corresponds geographically to mid-latitudes in Europe. A further outcome of this study is that some slight, occasional changes in induction vectors can be attributed to increased geomagnetic activity because they are correlated to the planetary diurnal Ap index."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c31d529543c72336543da2","5e709451878c28a0473ba609"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"21","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"3-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c31d529543c72336543da2","5e709451878c28a0473ba609"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e717c9046e0fb0001cf9fb1","title":"Ukrainian Antarctic Journal","issn":"1727-7485","documentHash":"a364e9b5-e3d5-452e-9681-2cad566f6001"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a108754097071121a33af3","year":"2023","volume":"21","number":"1","documentHash":"e35a0c46-c749-441a-abd0-b9ef1f0995fb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["auroral zone,geomagnetic activity,ionospheric currents,magnetotellurics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059245244"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65a159314097071121a9f5b7","name":"Hossein","lastName":"Hamidifar","documentHash":"3c0b2e17-56a0-48a8-8b58-bd0267640474"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","name":"MICHAEL","lastName":"NONES","uuid":"B4914AC97C650667BF5D9E583192DB532C1DA42B4B9204018194B0AA7AAE1F0EDC0539AC33BF1D2055B6771BBA95B52EDA2B3B3AD73872A38326ED211B1651C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4395-2637","documentHash":"e931d442-a9f1-4ea6-a34d-11a380da3c3b"}],"objectId":"65a159314097071121a9f5b4","doi":"10.1002/rvr2.45","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/rvr2.45","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Spatiotemporal variations of riverine flood fatalities: 70 years global to regional perspective","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Floods are among the most devastating natural hazards worldwide. While rainfall is the primary trigger of floods, human activities and climate change can exacerbate the impacts of floods and lead to more significant economic and social consequences. In this research, fluvial flood fatalities in the 1951–2020 period have been studied, analyzing the information reported in the Emergency Database (EM-DAT). The EM-DAT data were classified into five categories in terms of the number of events and fatalities connected with riverine floods, considering only events that caused more than 10 fatalities. The results show that the severity of flood-related fatalities is not equally distributed worldwide, but presents specific geographical patterns. The flood fatality coefficient, which represents the ratio between the total number of fatalities and the number of flood events, calculated for different countries, identified that the Southern, Eastern, and South-Eastern regions of Asia have the deadliest floods in the world. The number of flood events has been increasing since 1951 and peaked in 2007, following a relative decline since then. Though, the resulting fatalities do not follow a statistically significant trend. An analysis of the number of flood events in different decades shows that the 2001–2010 decade saw the highest number of events, which corresponds to the largest precipitation anomaly in the world. The lethality of riverine floods decreased over time, from 412 per flood in 1951–1960 to 67 in the 2011–2020 decade. This declining trend is probably a consequence of a more resilient environment and better risk reduction strategies. Based on the presented data and using regression analysis, relationships between flood fatalities and the number of flood events with population density and gross domestic product are developed and discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"222-238","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65a159314097071121a9f5b7","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"65a159314097071121a9f5b5","title":"RIVER","issn":"2750-4867","websiteLink":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/27504867","documentHash":"de106c79-cd66-4f0e-b667-228957514a49"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a159314097071121a9f5b6","year":"2023","volume":"2","number":"4","documentHash":"459ee602-ff1c-4556-aa9e-f4e3b04aa4b4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059245758"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"654c523840e3ff4ef3f58233","name":"Hossein","lastName":"Hamidifar","uuid":"EA250DA4FE16DAE088E554EF21C8C6B4A8C997E8885681BD911A60EEBE3520AFC0B4E94AB124AC868D1F0AFEA39D94860D4FFFE215BA1B8975CCF59BEFB5ED11","documentHash":"2ac621c8-e36e-4b9a-96db-6591e38f59e4"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","name":"MICHAEL","lastName":"NONES","uuid":"B4914AC97C650667BF5D9E583192DB532C1DA42B4B9204018194B0AA7AAE1F0EDC0539AC33BF1D2055B6771BBA95B52EDA2B3B3AD73872A38326ED211B1651C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4395-2637","documentHash":"e931d442-a9f1-4ea6-a34d-11a380da3c3b"}],"objectId":"65a15aee4097071121a9ffb3","doi":"10.1080/02626667.2023.2230197","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02626667.2023.2230197","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Hydro-morphodynamic responses of rivers to the construction of hydropower dams: a case study – the Kor River, Iran","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The impact of dams on fluvial hydro-morphology in arid and semi-arid regions, such as the Middle East, has received little attention, although such fluvial corridors represent major sources of livelihood for the local population.

It aids in mitigating the detrimental effects of water scarcity, facilitates sustainable resource management, and informs policy decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehensively comprehend the dynamics and trends of drought-related phenomena. This study aims to explore the relationship between six low water quantity terms including drought, water crisis, water scarcity, water shortage, water stress, and water insecurity and some socio-economic, geographic, and demographic parameters for different regions of the world and to predict the future trend of public interest in the mentioned terms using Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM) models. Google Trend data analysis was used to examine the public interest in these terms from 2017 to 2022. The LSTM models were trained using historical data on the studied terms, and their performance was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) indicator. The Google Trend data analysis showed that public interest in water shortage and water insecurity increased significantly from 2017 to 2022. The LSTM models showed promising results for predicting future trends in the mentioned water related issues, with RMSE scores (dimensionless) ranging from 0.04 to 0.43. The most significant socio-economic, geographic and demographic parameters were found to be population, life expectancy, access to drinking water, and access to Internet while there was no correlation between precipitation and searched terms. The results suggest that LSTM models can be an effective tool for forecasting water related issues and emphasizes the importance of socio-economic, geographic and demographic parameters in the public search behaviour around the world. The study also highlights the increasing public awareness of water related issues and the need for sustainable water management practices, particularly in regions with high water shortage and insecurity. The LSTM-based prediction models in this study have practical applications in early warning systems for droughts, community education on water conservation, prioritizing vulnerable areas, assessing public perception of climate change's relation to droughts, and evaluating water policies. Further research is needed to improve the accuracy of these models incorporating the effective parameters and to develop effective strategies for managing water resources in regions facing water scarcity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

change is rapidly deteriorating the climatic signal  in Svalbard glaciers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Svalbard archipelago is particularly sensitive to climate change due to the relatively low altitude of its main ice fields and its geographical location in the higher North Atlantic, where the effect of Arctic amplification is more significant. The largest temperature increases have been observed during winter, but increasing summer temperatures, above the melting point, have led to increased glacier melt. Here, we evaluate the impact of this increased melt on the preservation of the oxygen isotope (δ18O) signal in firn records. δ18O is commonly used as a proxy for past atmospheric temperature reconstructions, and, when preserved, it is a crucial parameter to date and align ice cores. By comparing four different firn cores collected in 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2019 at the top of the Holtedahlfonna ice field (1100 m a.s.l.), we show a progressive deterioration of the isotope signal, and we link its degradation to the increased occurrence and intensity of melt events. Our findings indicate that, starting from 2015, there has been an escalation in melting and percolation resulting from changes in the overall atmospheric conditions. This has led to the deterioration of the climate signal preserved within the firn or ice. Our observations correspond with the model's calculations, demonstrating an increase in water percolation since 2014, potentially reaching deeper layers of the firn. Although the δ18O signal still reflects the interannual temperature trend, more frequent melting events may in the future affect the interpretation of the isotopic signal, compromising the use of Svalbard ice cores. Our findings highlight the impact and the speed at which Arctic amplification is affecting Svalbard's cryosphere."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"307-320","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5df6","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5df7","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5df8","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5df9","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5dfa","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5dfb","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5dfc","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5dfd","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5dfe","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5dff","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5e00","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5e01","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5e02","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5e03","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5e04","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5e05","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5e06","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5e07","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5e08","5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5e09","65a7c3cd4097071e0b8a5e0a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477849","mniswId":"4565","title":"Cryosphere","issn":"1994-0416","eissn":"1994-0424","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"b3eaeb1b-4cd1-4827-a8bd-35e8822e76d8"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059269435"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Napiórkowski","uuid":"6AE9EEECF23A9027016CE0A5043569229D6A23680190D0C326173C1E6985FE82CE8B15504F7C20E43EC7B867AD3C2CF79197D909B3D518AC611E0C30D884583C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0273-4193","documentHash":"03e7ee2b-1337-4436-8dc2-d4e7730e5939"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","name":"Adam","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"864E3E49A2309C1FB479470AD68682EA3FAB4349A58557B0478C54157BBB2B92E9A4D1252BEC5AB9362F29E198D2892DA7519ED222E344D6630D3217C0FDAF82","orcidId":"0000-0003-0923-7314","documentHash":"25196237-6284-406e-a277-91b7ddef9871"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7de3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Piotrowska","uuid":"FBAE40D7319650E11C0335FA5D6AA1095965B08F4AD4DF082E1E05FD0FF22BE67CD6CC9F2E9E395A94A0570C621B182E6FFA1D8EE667ED711144DDA75303A79C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0375-1227","documentHash":"560ab5f6-23ff-45e8-86e6-0122de212bcd"}],"objectId":"65a8eb5d40970706a44f82fa","doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2023.119766","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0020025523013518?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"To what extent evolutionary algorithms can benefit from a longer search?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In many comparison papers Evolutionary Algorithms are stopped after a pre-defined number of function calls, which is a code-independent measure of computational time.

The question how much improvement could be achieved by Evolutionary Algorithms if they were given much more time is surprisingly rarely asked. In the present study we analyze improvements obtained by thirty Evolutionary Algorithms on four different benchmark sets, including one composed of 22 real-world problems, when the allowed number of function calls is extended ten times with respect to the values defined in the comparison criteria for the specific benchmark sets. We analyze how the prolonged search would affect the ranking of algorithms, how much improvement could be obtained by Evolutionary Algorithms in general, on what kind of problems the improvement will be achieved, and which type of algorithms would benefit most from such an extended search. We show that the improvements obtained in prolonged search are higher for real-world problems than for mathematical functions, and such improvements are mainly achieved by similar kinds of adaptive algorithms proposed relatively recently.

To deal with the increasing number of flooding events hitting Europe in the last few decades, around twenty years ago the European Commission started to develop ad-hoc legislation to reduce flood risk by mapping flood hazard and risk areas, such as the Directive 2007/60/EC on the Assessment and Management of Flood Risk. This Directive looks to identify regions where flood management strategies should be prioritized. Despite this holistic approach, flaws connected to the consideration of sediment transport and morphological changes in rivers exist, leading to potential underestimations of the impact of floods affecting active watercourses or areas subjected to frequent morphological changes.\n\nResults\nBy discussing six examples related to European lowland and mountain watercourses affected by significant floods in the last 20 years, the present mini-review aims to provide additional evidence on the need for a rethinking of flood risk mapping, moving from a “clear water” perspective to a more integrated approach, where the interactions between all the fluvial components (water, sediment, biota, and humans) are adequately considered.\n\nConclusions\nThe examples reported here show the importance of considering sediment and wood in flood risk management, suggesting the need for integrating flood-related studies with other disciplines like geomorphology and ecohydrology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

variability of tropospheric winds over West Sumatra and their changes associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation, Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, Madden–Julian Oscillations and convectively coupled Kelvin waves during the extended boreal winter season are investigated based on nineteen years of observations from Equatorial Atmosphere Radar in Kototabang, Indonesia. Sub-diurnal wind variability is assessed based on the amplitude and phase of the diurnal (24 h) and semidiurnal (12 h) modes.The results show that composite diurnal variability is dominated by cloud-induced circulation and thermal tides. Although these sub-diurnal modes do not change the daily mean wind direction, they modulate velocities throughout the day. Typical diurnal evolution of the vertical wind component is consistent with changes in the latent heating profiles associated with the evolution of a cloud field from cumulus before noon to deep convection in the afternoon and stratiform clouds in the evening. El Niño Southern Oscillation and Quasi-Biennial Oscillation affect the mean tropospheric winds, throughout the troposphere and above 250 hPa, respectively, but do not affect sub-diurnal amplitudes. Eastward propagating Madden–Julian Oscillations and convectively coupled Kelvin waves impact both the mean and sub-diurnal tropospheric wind variability. Both horizontal and vertical winds show the largest variability in the lower and mid troposphere (below 400 hPa). The observed variability in the vertical wind component highlights that large-scale phenomena interact with both the local evolution and progression of a cloud field through dynamical feedback."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709445878c28a0473b9529","60c2fd3e9543c723365434fc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1521","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c2fd3e9543c723365434fc","5e709445878c28a0473b9529","659ff37740970707a13093a6","659ff37740970707a13093a7","659ff37740970707a13093a8","659ff37740970707a13093a9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724b","mniswId":"2021","title":"Atmosphere","issn":"2073-4433","eissn":"2073-4433","documentHash":"902de84c-dfa4-4b92-8c42-f089148bc7be"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659ff37740970707a13093a5","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"10","documentHash":"019b0c30-a97b-4fe5-a3a4-635810c7abe7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["diurnal cycle of tropospheric winds; diurnal precipitation variability; Equatorial Atmosphere Radar; Sumatra; atmospheric tides"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059287041"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c972","name":"Alnilam","lastName":"Fernandes","uuid":"AEFF83A493CDEA259DD6251E65F029F3B6C7C876B3EEF8C6ACB00284DF3F482FEF3E32D3AEC2926AEEABE459115780E9EDECDB0BE0B17D0861A0693C45D580FA","documentHash":"8c2180c0-b88e-4b58-8592-bfa946cdcfe9"},{"objectId":"5e70936c878c28a0473a93e2","name":"Artur","lastName":"Szkop","uuid":"8317D5091AD75A551A97A451F2A5E1291BA422C800AEFE25839E6C822DF1B70F69EB3E7AD820A50E6E4A530E15C76E9C8E3E8B341E7D4C26E9BA9467DCC649CD","documentHash":"fe189e19-d172-4b09-826b-83880ace85d4"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7c28","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Pietruczuk","uuid":"3DBB552BC61CDBB0CA395E812239D596269AF17548EA28265F75D887C65C0BE5DB10A3A2FA3543538617BA27900579EB35AF63A2699FA59BD3F0C2859526D8B2","orcidId":"0000-0001-7058-3879","documentHash":"fb35a789-7b87-4818-9f1a-3d71ef7065c8"}],"objectId":"659ff5e840970707a130c098","doi":"10.3390/atmos14091409","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/14/9/1409/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Comparison of the Performance of the GRASP and MERRA2 Models in Reproducing Tropospheric Aerosol Layers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Two approaches, based on Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties (GRASP) and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) models, are investigated for reproducing aerosol layers in the troposphere. The GRASP algorithm is supplied with synergistic LIDAR and sunphotometer measurements to obtain aerosol extinction profiles. MERRA-2 is an atmospheric reanalysis coupling model that includes an external mixture of sea salt, dust, organic carbon, black carbon, and sulfate aerosols. A data set from Racibórz observatory, obtained with LIDAR and a sunphotometer in the 2017–2020 period, is analysed with GRASP along with the closest grid point data given by MERRA-2. The models demonstrate satisfactory agreement, yet some discrepancies were observed, indicating the presence of biases. For vertically integrated profiles, the correlation coefficient (R) between aerosol optical thickness was calculated to be 0.84, indicating a strong linear relationship. The Pearson correlation coefficient calculated between profiles for the selected altitude sectors varies between 0.428 and 0.824, indicating moderate to good agreement at all altitudes. GRASP shows denser aerosol layers in the mid-troposphere, while MERRA-2 gives higher aerosol extinctions throughout the high troposphere to low stratosphere region. Moreover, GRASP does not provide vertical variability in the extinction profile near the ground, due to a lack of data in the LIDAR’s incomplete overlap range. Lastly, the aerosol layer identification and type recognition are validated with statistical analysis of air mass backward trajectories with endpoints spatially and temporally collocated with individual identified layers. These reveal potential source regions that are located within areas known to be significant sources for the different identified aerosol types."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709359878c28a0473a7c28","62c796a8752340480571c972","5e70936c878c28a0473a93e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1409","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c796a8752340480571c972","5e70936c878c28a0473a93e2","5e709359878c28a0473a7c28"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724b","mniswId":"2021","title":"Atmosphere","issn":"2073-4433","eissn":"2073-4433","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e99bbe2c-fe08-4cb7-999f-c3a55335bedc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659ff5e840970707a130c099","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"9","documentHash":"030eef37-0286-4f3e-9bbe-2d59d010376d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aerosol layer; GRASP; MERRA-2"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059287078"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65a1064a4097071121a31e62","name":"Ahmet T.","lastName":"Başokur","documentHash":"b996a7a6-16b3-4ca7-baf6-8211fe393b36"},{"objectId":"5e709451878c28a0473ba609","name":"Anne","lastName":"Neska","uuid":"92EE69D807C17CE3F32C9DC5C9D2AF7D74163341364872B00075A851B3E632D4CBAF20E3C5BB47A50F3C2D8CAA59F817F877D6416DC03F0BB574C72A247C375A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6749-2052","documentHash":"25976731-d71e-42d3-a2de-efd936ebf695"}],"objectId":"65a1064a4097071121a31e60","doi":"10.1007/s10712-023-09817-5","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10712-023-09817-5.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Guest Editorial: Special Issue on the 25th Electromagnetic Induction Workshop, Çeşme, Turkey","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709451878c28a0473ba609"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"45","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65a1064a4097071121a31e62","5e709451878c28a0473ba609"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989c","mniswId":"19171","title":"Surveys in Geophysics","issn":"0169-3298","eissn":"1573-0956","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"128173ec-4562-4bc5-a299-b6af45a4c43a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6628ccf64097073ca70f756d","year":"2024","volume":"","number":"45","doi":"","documentHash":"7dc7ccee-2be2-4f4a-bca0-73796c793942"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059287292"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65a1199f4097071121a56ba3","name":"D.V.","lastName":"Hlavatskyi","documentHash":"5c9421dd-eaac-4f0b-ae55-28beef2ac805"},{"objectId":"65a1199f4097071121a56ba2","name":"S.I.","lastName":"Cherkes","documentHash":"ef2e4f8f-3741-46a6-b111-0baf40b03f88"},{"objectId":"65a1199f4097071121a56ba1","name":"I.B.","lastName":"Poliachenko","documentHash":"4f9f4ad0-d63f-4ea6-b345-94d7d29d27f3"},{"objectId":"627dc2a975234056eb6afbc7","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Bakhmutov","uuid":"7059FD3AE9096C82FAA942B8AF10C90EE2792230DC7C6461E41A0CFFDDA266C75F06F8C0B319E5D5CA564C79CAB7D68202774C7E149D0871580D98687BCCFD05","documentHash":"c1071bf8-bbc7-40bb-b846-f91c57011563"}],"objectId":"65a1199f4097071121a56b9f","doi":"10.24028/gj.v44i6.273638","publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/geofizicheskiy/article/download/273638/269488","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Palaeomagnetism of the Vendian traps of Volyn, southwestern margin of the East European Platform, P. 2: magnetostratigraphy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present new results of palaeomagnetic studies of the Vendian (Ediacaran) rocks of the Volyn Basalt Province revealed by six boreholes on the NW Ukraine. This is a continuation of previous studies of upper part of the Volyn series described by Bakhmutov et al. [2021]. In the recent works [Shcherbakova et al., 2020; Thallner et al., 2022], the results of palaeointensity determinations of the Volyn series basalts showed the ultra-low dipole moment of Earth’s magnetic field which coincident with other palaeomagnetic data for Ediacaran indicating an extremely weak geomagnetic field. Clear stratification and correlation of the basalt and tuff layers by magnetic parameters allow us to determine the magnetic field reversals throughout the stratigraphic succession of the Volyn series of about 400 m thick. In basalts, tuffs and baked contact rocks, a high-temperature characteristic component of remanent magnetization (ChRM) with all signs of primary magnetization have been isolated. For the directions of inclination of ChRM-components at least six magnetic polarity reversals were revealed. The geochronological ages of rocks is in the range of 580—545 Ma, but the errors in the age estimation are too large for separation of individual formations within the pulses of activity or differentiation of individual eruptions. Therefore the formation time of the entire stratum remains uncertain, and the key issue for interpretation of the magnetic polarity reversal frequency is the duration of accumulation of traps. Two possible interpretations of palaeomagnetic results are considered. In the first, which takes into account different stages of magmatic activity, the time interval of accumulation can be about 10 million years. Then the average frequency of geomagnetic inversions is close to mean for the Phanerozoic. We prefer the other interpretation when the formations of the Large Igneous Provinces have been occurred over a short time interval (e.g. 0.5 Myr). Taking into account the results of palaeointensity estimations for the same samples, which shown the extremely weak geomagnetic field, the hypothesis of the «hyperactivity» of the field with a frequency of at least 12 reversals per one million years on the end of the Ediacaran gain the additional confirmation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

increasing extreme events driven by climate change, the relationship between drought and wildfire events and their impacts on society is of paramount importance, necessitating comprehensive studies to understand long-term trends. This manuscript utilizes the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) to gather data on drought and wildfire events, focusing on the number of affected people and human losses. The analysis covers the period from 1983 to 2022 and incorporates eco-hydro-socio-geographical variables such as gross domestic product (GDP), precipitation anomaly, population density, and forested area. The study reveals significant geographical disparities in the impacts of drought and wildfire. Asia stands out as the region most affected by these phenomena, with more than 72% of individuals experiencing their effects. In contrast, Europe and Oceania show negligible impacts, accounting for less than 1% collectively. When it comes to losses specifically caused by drought, Asia has the highest share at around 82%. Conversely, Oceania has the lowest share, with less than 0.1% of total losses attributed to drought. In the case of wildfires, Africa takes the lead with 84% of total losses. On the other hand, Oceania, Europe, Asia, and America collectively contribute only 16% to the total losses, which is considerably lower. Temporal analysis indicates an increasing trend in the number of people affected by both drought and wildfire, particularly after the early 2000s, potentially attributed to the improved reporting in EM-DAT. Correlation tests highlight the inverse relationship between GDP and the studied parameters, while precipitation anomaly exhibits an inverse correlation with wildfire-affected populations. Forested area significantly correlates with wildfire-related damages. These insights can inform policies and actions at various levels, from local to international, to address the challenges posed by climate-related disasters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"120","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"957-973","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","65a69cb7409707136ffde427","65a69cb7409707136ffde428"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f6a","mniswId":"14787","title":"Natural Hazards","issn":"0921-030X","eissn":"1573-0840","documentHash":"7c7de78a-32f5-4d0e-9cfa-8fcca968365d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a69cb7409707136ffde426","year":"2023","volume":"120","number":"1","documentHash":"b552a173-20df-4565-896c-f1ea9b367abe"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Drought EM-DAT GDP Human losses Wildfires"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059303549"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c337969543c72336544149","name":"Motuma ","lastName":" Regasa","uuid":"16D39B99405C260E5EE724B2712D8075C7EF73E21F92FB58256AB5B7E13D4FEBACC5DBA375FAED178428D73468842760BB9D79D3E7932142CBE5541DAFE01D9B","documentHash":"aa31f51a-8437-4915-bd61-c84c21c017ea"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","name":"MICHAEL","lastName":"NONES","uuid":"B4914AC97C650667BF5D9E583192DB532C1DA42B4B9204018194B0AA7AAE1F0EDC0539AC33BF1D2055B6771BBA95B52EDA2B3B3AD73872A38326ED211B1651C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4395-2637","documentHash":"e931d442-a9f1-4ea6-a34d-11a380da3c3b"}],"objectId":"65a8eff640970706a44ff555","doi":"10.1007/s40899-023-01011-0","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40899-023-01011-0.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Modeling the impact of historical and future land use land cover changes on the hydrological response of an Ethiopian watershed","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Land Use Land Cover (LULC) is generally considered one of the key factors influencing the hydrological processes and sediment output in arid and semi-arid watersheds. Focusing on the Ethiopian Fincha watershed, the current study applies the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to evaluate how LULC changes affect the watershed hydrological dynamics. Utilizing the available stream flow time series data acquired from 1986 to 2008, the model was calibrated and validated based on past conditions. At the same time, future scenarios were simulated by means of the Land Change Modeler (LCM) model using historical trends. To investigate the effect of LULC changes on watershed hydrology, six LULC maps have been produced to account for historical (1989, 2004, 2019) and future (2030, 2040, 2050) conditions. The results show an increase in surface runoff in the past, while a similar tendency is expected for the next three decades if no specific mitigation measures will be implemented soon. On the other hand, lateral flow and groundwater flow are generally decreasing. The present analysis shows that the ongoing LULC transformation, which involves an expansion of agricultural land, urban areas, and intermittent logging of forest cover, may be the reason for the increment in surface runoff, and the decline in groundwater and lateral flow."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","60c337969543c72336544149"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c337969543c72336544149","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f164","mniswId":"27920","title":"Sustainable Water Resources Management","issn":"2363-5037","eissn":"2363-5045","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"ad90247b-2098-4140-9df2-424faf547874"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a8eff640970706a44ff556","year":"2024","volume":"10","number":"1","documentHash":"7666aec1-4748-47c9-9b26-8239cfc6e197"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ethiopia Fincha watershed Hydrology Land use land cover Sediment yield Soil and water assessment tool"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059304097"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65c620a7409707713036e98e","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Mazur","documentHash":"8d99ba0c-4f70-445b-8c79-66e111ebb601"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a94","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Jóźwiak","uuid":"4E5E132578D4BB8C6699ABA9D9AA755BEDE5EDCF78BB9D2222333F2D3EA1F03E2F5712F4FF017D3F481FE74BE181898526F74DC8C3F49B082930F3B967FDB9D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1363-2934","documentHash":"4d028842-73fe-4207-85dc-690885a13fbc"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a91","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nowożyński","uuid":"B4EB89CB942D5A430A9FEB8EE16693BCEF80CFCB9CD8B73CD6F1F307D6D6A6CCAEB3EEC25BB267FA6C54CDDF9D4F20BE25AD181220DD49C3A71174C186744971","orcidId":"0000-0002-5225-8041","documentHash":"09ac3b93-9a89-459b-8f84-096e5bb066cc"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac905","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Oryński","uuid":"A17EA2EE114F671518354F32A8ED76AB1E3A7196F2763C307ADE9326E4BB84E23171FE6093FE73D734C78BDA024BC40ECAD077ADA22A39DF3F641AC6E3CDFCC1","orcidId":"0000-0001-5764-4876","documentHash":"61882f30-20a1-421c-8d64-9698828ead87"}],"objectId":"65c620a7409707713036e98c","doi":"10.1016/j.tecto.2024.230213","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0040195124000155?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Magnetotelluric evidence for long-lasting crustal memory in an intraplate setting – the Grójec Fault and Mid-Polish Trough in central Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Grójec Fault (GF) is of significant interest due to its orientation perpendicular to the dominant NW-SE structural grain in the transition zone from Precambrian to Phanerozoic Europe. The fault is located along the extension of the boundary between the Sarmatia and Fennoscandia segments of the East European Craton (EEC). While Late Cretaceous fault activity has been documented by studies since the 1980s, its earlier history remains poorly understood. To better understand the deep crustal structure and its link to shallow deformation, new magnetotelluric data from 39 points, along with older geomagnetic data from 22 survey points, were used to create a three-dimensional (3-D) model of the geoelectric structure. The ModEM 3-D inversion code was used to interpret the data and create a model of resistivity distribution. The magnetotelluric and auxiliary gravimetric data show a continuation of the suture between Fennoscandia and Sarmatia in the substratum of the Palaeozoic Platform, indicating the SW-ward extension of basement belonging to the EEC. The data reveal activity of the GF and coinciding suture zone during early Permian rifting and post-rift Mesozoic subsidence, manifested by transverse segmentation of the Mid-Polish Trough (MPT). This evidence, in combination with previously documented strike-slip activity of the GF during Late Cretaceous basin inversion, points to a long-lasting crustal weakness zone associated with the GF. A significant result of the modelling was the identification of a large, highly-conducting anomaly in the Earth's crust visible from a depth of 8 km and extending in the NW-SE direction beneath the axis of the MPT. The anomaly suggests fluid migration from the upper mantle causing the precipitation of conducting minerals during the rifting phase, mainly sulphides and graphite."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938d878c28a0473ac905","5e709410878c28a0473b5a94","5e709410878c28a0473b5a91"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"873","pagesFromTo":"230213","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65c620a7409707713036e98e","5e709410878c28a0473b5a94","5e709410878c28a0473b5a91","5e70938d878c28a0473ac905"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798ea","mniswId":"19321","title":"TECTONOPHYSICS","issn":"0040-1951","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"9f63cb9a-9c0e-4130-95a8-fd356130be11"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c620a7409707713036e98d","year":"2024","volume":"873","documentHash":"bcbd2c10-072f-494a-aa86-9bafaf87c16a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059390120"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65df3a4e4097070d575e00da","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kolerski","documentHash":"519c2e6f-190d-4074-857b-5bf1d5ba9a4c"},{"objectId":"65df3a4e4097070d575e00d9","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Biegowski","documentHash":"0a5221a3-31ec-4953-9a6a-74c0a087c127"},{"objectId":"65df3a4e4097070d575e00d7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Łoboda","documentHash":"96a47e92-a457-4859-93b1-d49850d8e9d4"},{"objectId":"65df3a4e4097070d575e00d6","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Cuban","documentHash":"8771f38b-2b07-4ae5-9e94-30ceaf86e445"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abd8e","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Przyborowski","uuid":"2754E03EAD5086898936AFDB02E83F74F31AA479A3A647F230576A77C356868291C406E4B4F1977EFC59E5DA0B0FD46185D3ED89EFF54B8037D1A0522F3DF534","orcidId":"0000-0003-0900-1387","documentHash":"64d0a52f-ee6e-4c33-8fa6-d63704db387b"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d787","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Robakiewicz","uuid":"6DE434FFEDD594D9BAE71BBB1AFAECC7D88A155B2D011DED06C94F025FE13DDCC2C419296BF743BFF2218CBE56346165A4584860B38D25E8C50D634FC8B1F9E8","orcidId":"0000-0002-9936-3527","documentHash":"1a48960e-f68c-454e-93ab-73bee94e1a3a"}],"objectId":"65df3a4e4097070d575e00d4","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171184","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969724013238?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The effect of groyne field on trapping macroplastic. Preliminary results from laboratory experiments","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Macroplastic, a precursor of microplastic pollution, has become a new scope of research interest. However, the physical processes of macroplastic transport and deposition in rivers are poorly understood, which makes the decisions of where to locate macroplastic trapping infrastructure difficult. In this research, we conducted a series of experiments in a laboratory channel, exploring the impact of groynes and flexible artificial vegetation on the floating macroplastic litter. The goal was to investigate the litter paths with different obstruction arrangements, which was done by implementing a particle tracking technique on video recordings from each experimental run. We found that increasing discharge correlated with the number of plastic litter floating into the recirculation zone within the groyne fields, especially if the upstream groyne had an extended length. This produced a strong mixing interface between the main flow and the groyne field, while a vegetation patch added in the same groyne field changed the paths of plastic litter by deflecting the flow. We noticed that during a moderate discharge rate, the litter pieces flowing into the groyne field with the vegetation circulated there for the longest period, and some of them got entangled between floating stems when discharge was at its lowest. This phenomenon points to the conclusion that low flow velocity paired with the presence of vegetation can be a primer for plastic deposition and consequently, its degradation. The insights from the experiment allowed us to recommend a place downstream of an extended groyne as the desirable (efficient) area for installing a plastic trapping infrastructure or conducting plastic cleaning actions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709386878c28a0473abd8e","65df3a4e4097070d575e00d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d787"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"921","pagesFromTo":"171184","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709386878c28a0473abd8e","65df3a4e4097070d575e00d6","65df3a4e4097070d575e00d7","5e7092d3878c28a04739d787","65df3a4e4097070d575e00d9","65df3a4e4097070d575e00da"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","issn":"0048-9697","documentHash":"536a2e2c-aae7-4edb-84d0-5d817a2d0285"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65df3a4e4097070d575e00d5","year":"2024","volume":"921","documentHash":"df33228c-4350-4adb-8a21-421d621b4930"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059411655"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094b2878c28a0473c1bfc","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Werner","uuid":"1F27D2B1BA8431CCEDF36918E3D757ADE4955CA5C2147C9B4FA5BB12222B01FECCAC3BAAA195B29443685106244471C827EFBD78FF7BB453D6358B3A86BB9CE4","orcidId":"0000-0002-7980-0646","documentHash":"e935c9c8-2ba9-40bd-94d5-699f7d20c09d"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b","name":"Beata","lastName":"Górka-Kostrubiec","uuid":"837CE8D75E0ECD3E327460670495F33AD004F18316960AEE744DCB63710EB639069A5F2B1240E8B20E21AC170FC616C7D7E9D246798C609ADE31FA8E049F61DF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6337-7583","documentHash":"2b3d8aa3-c2a8-4bd0-a8fa-dd1830c1e138"},{"objectId":"5e7093b3878c28a0473af6d7","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Karasiński","uuid":"B1F20B32A56D63D76A266DCCC85AC861861587CFDD64886C0B1F252726B4C42650FACAD5681FF27ACE0AED95B423BEE26F984ABED9C7C011782CF16E9C5AD358","orcidId":"0000-0001-8846-9572","documentHash":"7ec5b6a6-f95b-43f3-8604-3eb0faa8ecea"}],"objectId":"65d466d64097074f285182a2","doi":"10.1007/s11356-023-31416-5","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11356-023-31416-5.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Measuring magnetic susceptibility of particulate matter collected on filters","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The magnetic susceptibility (κ) of particulate matter (PM) is a useful tool in estimation concentration of iron-rich particles and provides useful information on the emission sources and pathways of spread of PM in the atmosphere. However, there is currently no established protocol for measuring the magnetic susceptibility of PM collected on filters used in standard monitoring of PM concentration. This paper presents a step-by-step process for collecting PM on filters in automatic samplers and measuring their κ. The procedure outlines requirements for data quality, measurement uncertainty, exposure time and conditions, and the amount of material collected on the filters. The study analyzed a 2-year dataset of magnetic susceptibility measurements by MFK-1 kappabridge (Agico, Czech Republic) for PM10 and PM2.5 collected at two locations, Warsaw and Cracow, in Poland using low-volume PM samplers. By strictly following the procedure for conditioning filters, measuring magnetic susceptibility and mass of PM, the study found that it is possible to obtain repeatable data with good measurement accuracy and acceptable errors. This makes magnetic susceptibility an additional reliable parameter for tracking of emission sources of iron-rich particles. Successful implementation of this magnetic method as a standard procedure for monitoring PM in addition to the PM mass collected on filters could be used to analyze sources of emission of Fe-particles and their contribution to the PM mass, especially in urban and industrial environments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b3878c28a0473af6d7","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b","5e7094b2878c28a0473c1bfc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"31","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"4733-4746","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b","5e7093b3878c28a0473af6d7","5e7094b2878c28a0473c1bfc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b16","mniswId":"5845","title":"Environmental Science and Pollution Research","issn":"0944-1344","eissn":"1614-7499","documentHash":"a276ab08-d4e3-4e6f-8f21-94c32ed97f96"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d466d64097074f285182a3","year":"2024","volume":"31","number":"3","documentHash":"09fcfb18-bef4-4920-8efc-9aedb4457042"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Particulate matter (PM) Magnetic susceptibility of PM Mass of PM PM collected on filter Low-volume PM sampler"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059418307"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Osuch","uuid":"A15CE4704BFC55F4D73C5551A1BF8F722C8079811C8D2926C74DE5E2098F109CCBA98FF443EA760E7212470B8FEC3F616067AD3C9D8E6C8BEC9D2B1C3908DE94","orcidId":"0000-0002-1887-3569","documentHash":"447f1351-672a-4b79-b06d-7741f68786bb"},{"objectId":"5e7093d0878c28a0473b1309","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Opała-Owczarek","uuid":"0BF5EACEBE52AAAE18A15D8E28D5F5BD9597D484947D425C2EBCF85A9DF28F5556F1C3ED9AC8F28FCD7116465950AA4662E1D8A3F3A21E243F6D6DE9E19DFA15","orcidId":"0000-0002-0583-6443","documentHash":"9a0f96c4-07d0-41ef-98f3-e99bbad22116"},{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f3b1","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Łupikasza","uuid":"627F6A7B227A8D98C912114A8A9A436667607A1B381B2782CE5749BB175C1500410E98A8CD820CBF870E8BD9C9EF9E9F4FE621BF5634B8A1EFB9FE9F566FD24F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3910-9076","documentHash":"051e6841-ce85-416c-92dd-d65217116fb2"},{"objectId":"5e70922f878c28a047391653","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Owczarek","uuid":"3E93E8D14A5F06AA85DC9262014D8F44A2F9080DA86732409F4EA4F45E74EF2B113F7C281CA2454221A25BE55647178F233F0E8A1228545E3C2395909AFA831A","orcidId":"0000-0001-7877-7731","documentHash":"e8d3fd2b-bacc-428a-afe4-88f10418e026"},{"objectId":"5e70922f878c28a0473915eb","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Migała","uuid":"E20F90AA40F11EF4A47D1B87E17DC538FC46B5D74A157A4FA21D16FB082382A6CE116C91628BFD3EC90D679565500B162DB009C01493EFB5114C3298F2C7963B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0881-8109","documentHash":"8265fc8f-f6a2-4e07-baa5-fa99fc25f765"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65ccbb814097073ccbc910c3","doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-51869-z","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-51869-z","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Linking drought indices to atmospheric circulation in Svalbard, in the Atlantic sector of the High Arctic","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Based on long-term climatological data from Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard Airport—Longyearbyen and the Polish Polar Station at Hornsund, we undertook an analysis of drought indices on Spitsbergen Island, Svalbard, for the period 1979–2019. The features and causes of spatiotemporal variability of atmospheric drought in Svalbard were identified, as expressed by the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). There were several-year periods with SPEI indicating the dominance of drought or wet conditions. The long-term variability in the annual and half-year (May–October) SPEI values showed a prevalence of droughts in the 1980s and the first decade of the twenty-first century, while wet seasons were frequent in the 1990s and in the second decade of the twenty-first century. The seasonal SPEIs were characteristic of interannual variability. In MAM and JJA, droughts were more frequent after 2000; during SON and DJF of the same period, the frequency of wet seasons increased. The most remarkable changes in the scale of the entire research period occurred in autumn when negative values of SPEI occurred more often in the first part of the period, and positive values dominated in the last 20 years. The long-term pattern of the variables in consecutive seasons between 1979 and 2019 indicates relationships between the SPEI and anomalies of precipitable water and somewhat weaker relationships with anomalies of sea level pressure. The three stations are located at distances of more than 200 km from each other in the northern (Ny-Ålesund), central (Longyearbyen) and southern parts of Svalbard (Hornsund), and the most extreme values of drought conditions depended on the atmospheric circulation which could have been modified by local conditions thus droughts developed under various circulation types depending on the station. However, some similarities were identified in the atmospheric circulation patterns favouring drought conditions at Ny-Ålesund and Hornsund, both having more maritime climates than Longyearbyen. Extremely dry seasons were favoured by anticyclonic conditions, particularly a high-pressure ridge (type Ka) centred over Svalbard, air advection from the eastern sector under an influence of cyclone and negative precipitable water anomalies. During wet seasons anomalies of precipitable water were positive and cyclonic conditions dominated. These results were corroborated by the frequency of regional circulation types during JJA and DJF with the lowest and highest values of SPEI."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922f878c28a0473915eb","5e70922f878c28a047391653"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b1309","5e7092eb878c28a04739f3b1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-21","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922f878c28a0473915eb","5e70922f878c28a047391653","5e7092eb878c28a04739f3b1","5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","5e7093d0878c28a0473b1309"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"2045-2322","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Atmospheric dynamics","Atmospheric science","Climate sciences","Environmental sciences","Hydrology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059422204"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"602ce4ca9543c7410626e4f8","name":"Marta","lastName":"Majerska","uuid":"2A924016FE505B19F9EE96E83EFBFDC70D0F5480C96355C38F3900B80157D5D871C6672FB8C58E2BE23FCF034FB0757F01F224E7C337B10F2404A6A549B89558","documentHash":"de93beb5-346e-4229-a4dd-f30619e49101"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Osuch","uuid":"A15CE4704BFC55F4D73C5551A1BF8F722C8079811C8D2926C74DE5E2098F109CCBA98FF443EA760E7212470B8FEC3F616067AD3C9D8E6C8BEC9D2B1C3908DE94","orcidId":"0000-0002-1887-3569","documentHash":"447f1351-672a-4b79-b06d-7741f68786bb"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"C0584C144462F702B3240BEAC5B59EE267B2C41FD0108E80ADE2625711EBE1965DBD3F8183578828BBA3059F994E33D86CACFD8B0B3788616E7BE27271E913B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3393-753X","documentHash":"e1b00415-43de-446c-8e75-68765156a8a8"}],"objectId":"65e99a90409707132d317de1","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171298","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969724014372?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Long-term patterns and changes of unglaciated High Arctic stream thermal regime","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Although water temperature is one of the most important factors influencing hydrochemistry and river ecology, long-term monitoring and modelling of stream thermal temporal variability are uncommon. There is sparse research regarding the thermal regimes of Arctic rivers, especially in Svalbard, a geographical hotspot affected by extreme climate change and Arctic amplification. There is a need for improvement and better understanding of the factors influencing the stream water temperature regime. To address this research gap, we present a study of the non-glaciated arctic catchment, Fuglebekken (Spitsbergen, Svalbard). We propose methods for reconstructing the thermal regime of the Arctic stream based on available in-situ data. This study evaluates different sets of input variables with hourly time steps required to explain the variability in water temperature. The study comprises two modelling approaches, a stochastic transfer function Multiple Input Single Output and a supervised machine learning technique, Gaussian Process Regression, to simulate the water temperature in the years 2005–2022.\n\nThe ground temperature at a depth of 20 cm and total solar radiation were found to be the main forcings that explain most of the water temperature variability. The outputs of both models showed similar tendencies and patterns. A diurnal warming trend of 0.5–3.5 °C per decade has been detected in stream water temperature throughout the summer season.

Results of the characterization of the particles from both surface sediments and suspended dust from desert areas in Iceland confirmed that volcanic glass is an excellent marker of Icelandic dust origin. Classification diagrams of particle chemical composition clearly distinguished the volcanic glass particles from the local surface sediments at Hornsund, Svalbard. In the same diagrams, a few particles were found in the aerosols from Hornsund which were morphologically and chemically similar to the Icelandic volcanic glass particles. Such properties, in principle, cannot be considered exclusive to volcanic glass. However, since Iceland is the largest and the most active source of long-range transported dust in the northern European high latitudes, and air mass trajectories reaching Hornsund did, actually, pass Iceland before the aerosol collection in the period under consideration, these particles likely originated in Iceland. On the other hand, the comparison with local and Icelandic sediments revealed the presence in the aerosols from Hornsund of particle types that cannot be attributed to either local or Icelandic dust. This observation highlights the possibility of extending and validating the application of the proposed geochemical criterion to different dust sources across the Arctic and the sub-Arctic, provided a consistent geochemical databank of representative dust sources from these areas is arranged."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709310878c28a0473a23c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"322","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65ef04db409707499740d13a","65ef04db409707499740d13b","5e709310878c28a0473a23c8","65ef04db409707499740d13c","65ef04db409707499740d13d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724b","mniswId":"2021","title":"Atmosphere","issn":"2073-4433","eissn":"2073-4433","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e99bbe2c-fe08-4cb7-999f-c3a55335bedc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ef04db409707499740d139","year":"2024","volume":"15","number":"3","documentHash":"dfa3586a-a31e-4937-9b2e-917d0bc57953"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Icelandic dust; aerosol particles; sediment samples; scanning electron microscopy; mineral chemistry; provenance; Arctic region"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059494869"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6628c5b84097073ca70f1d2b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Pętlicki","documentHash":"e8be2186-576f-4ae1-a0e5-645320a0ed20"},{"objectId":"5ebeda99752340254fc4195b","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Puczko","uuid":"9306E74A902E2A10F1AC7AEC17145E85D2CDC41CEE3D343495A65CFC0E2582CA410EACD7560DA4951331802F5F20B08E8ADF4E9B21098DEA1C37B76F650CF41A","documentHash":"546355e7-00d8-4a6f-a268-3fd8fd285f3a"},{"objectId":"5e709440878c28a0473b8dfc","name":"Michał","lastName":"Laska","uuid":"2EECE73A57100A055B655772DA4A795C0CFBBD357A202A51D8493EBBAD71F7A14EE5AD8620CBC6A05F6E4574490A7CAB98AD31F774C398F85A19897C03FE08D1","orcidId":"0000-0001-9843-9457","documentHash":"78f90d96-ba3f-42e8-bf66-a2f8a89320a6"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b587f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Głowacki","uuid":"ADCBCCA81F1A06B7130C3C6D09DD944575C8A72EA3ED5557187A4DA4FC6B5AA65790B81C23EED987E61140DC70B02C3B0AE8F3AE98A984E10E6E43AC6988A232","orcidId":"0000-0003-1943-0900","documentHash":"1765fc1d-e50c-4fb1-b782-9a66d6e3d4cc"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Luks","uuid":"FC0F8C1A25CDF854727B23DAF6DD04D1AD9513696FBFA8C968355CC0EFB6A3BDEB4F2A5DDD1AE5371489624E4D31807972D8B5C54FCC96768719FBBC97225A9F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2287-385X","documentHash":"3f73f8a6-7975-4c35-be1a-579f2ca67494"},{"objectId":"5e7093a8878c28a0473ae842","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Ignatiuk","uuid":"9EA1B68BFBE264C6151BE2FF4B2F409E403C92A47AB8C32FA9B833DA78AE058BAE840A649C2DFEE6EB001C8322EDCD3D4F472711D504138B350A9B5BB1A0B4D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2947-474X","documentHash":"689c4a5a-35e3-46f5-8942-d663e5a89818"},{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f1d3","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Błaszczyk","uuid":"3D0023AD6153781042ED90FDD2628342B5393F66DEC7700ECBE54A0D313E8277BF75544F9AD51B962158B0226737903EA05C0328AE511014E17DF1DA87B00E16","orcidId":"0000-0002-9702-0440","documentHash":"804b3688-e0db-4979-baf3-dd903a1f624f"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f076","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Jania","uuid":"C5EB10D76EA50D3529F3DC9C2992A8C5F7E2D849C9D7D9F935708AF0DC071EAE0E78B4CC097A628983449DFA5D74AFE7EF77423AC9F51EC4F564270E3363E0FA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8531-7394","documentHash":"4cdf6236-2013-4763-82ca-ac18ab85b8d4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"6628c5b84097073ca70f1d28","doi":"10.5194/essd-16-1847-2024","publicUri":"https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/16/1847/2024/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"High temporal resolution records of the velocity of Hansbreen, a tidewater glacier in Svalbard.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Monitoring changes in glacial dynamics is essential for understanding the environmental response to accelerated climate warming in the Arctic. However, geodetic surveys in polar regions continue to present considerable challenges because of the harsh environmental conditions and the polar night. This study records a 14-year-long time series (2006–2019) of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) surveys of the positions of 16 ablation stakes distributed across Hansbreen, a tidewater glacier in southern Svalbard. The measurements were conducted with an exceptionally high temporal resolution, from about 1 week to about 1 month, and covering altitudes ranging from 20 to 490 m a.s.l. The position of one stake was surveyed every day. The primary data products consist of the stake coordinates and velocities. Time series of annual and seasonal velocities are also provided. This dataset may be a subject of further studies of glacier dynamics in relation to the long-term and seasonal impact of climate change on ice flow in the region. It also offers unique material for tuning numerical models of glacier dynamics and for validating satellite-derived products such as velocity and digital elevation models.

Furthermore, the Allan factor curves of the extremes suggest that the sequences of extremes are fractal for timescales up to the mean inter-extreme time. Our main findings are that the variation of the nonlinearity parameter in model M1 (leading to the increase of the distribution tail length) can cause a significant variation of the extreme characteristics and an increase of the clustering while the variation of the nonlinearity parameter in model M2 (with fixed distribution) has a little effect on extremes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba083"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"183","pagesFromTo":"114927","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba083","6638bffb4097076e57a89e6c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775bc","mniswId":"3450","title":"CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS","issn":"0960-0779","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"a49c9d43-dc1f-43ca-ad2a-793ff9d429ac"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6638c22d4097076e57a8af9b","year":"2024","volume":"","number":"183","doi":"","documentHash":"f449b753-7186-4cbc-a520-5f06552d777a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Nonlinear Langevin equationTime seriesRun theoryClustering of extremes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059585994"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b4621","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Rudziński","uuid":"961F1D1124C7A6EE5547DCF0BA71246B84C544674F664FFB9BCD28552206D586EA78801AAEE81E2CE810AE31B51A5D62634DE5956B6F789EEEEFB590163D028A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2748-4167","documentHash":"6c723c64-3a72-4e29-83d4-a0e99517c798"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac919","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Kokowski","uuid":"D7594DC2D9655749CB0669CAEE5315A8B84BFD1B0C7FC25829C6AB004D41CF560E289FE55209C3B2041F8C909F85BE1CD48F910D2B20D8104FBFD2FB1500C15D","documentHash":"e6e03a23-e6e5-401d-ba29-3307a5a74f4e"}],"objectId":"6638af114097076e57a728eb","doi":"10.1007/s00024-023-03315-w","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00024-023-03315-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Analysis of the Epicenter Location Accuracy for the Local Seismic Network Operated in the Mining Area Towards the Automation of Location Procedures","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Legnica-Głogów Copper District (LGCD) is one of the most active seismic regions in Europe. Several thousand seismic events induced by underground copper mines are recorded there each year, with the strongest reaching magnitudes above 4. Seismicity in LGCD is monitored by the LUMINEOS surface seismic network and the mine's underground networks. While the horizontal location uncertainty of the LUMINEOS network is about 300–600 m, the declared epicenter uncertainty of dense mine networks is less than 50 m. It gives us a unique opportunity to test the location accuracy of seismic events recorded by the LUMINEOS network determined with various algorithms and automatic procedure. In our work, we compared the location accuracies of traveltime-based algorithms LocSAT and NonLinLoc as well as waveform-based algorithm BackTrackBB. The iterative, Geiger-type LocSAT algorithm is used in routine daily processing for the LUMINEOS. Its downside is the need to use the S wave onset times, which in the case of the LUMINEOS network are very uncertain. As an alternative, we tested the probabilistic NonLinLoc algorithm, and the waveform based BackTrackBB algorithm. The BackTrackBB algorithm is known to work well with local, high noise seismic networks. We aimed to find out if it could be used routinely with the LUMINEOS data. In addition, we conducted a comparative analysis of the location uncertainty of these algorithms to determine the effectiveness of this parameter in assessing accuracy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938d878c28a0473ac919","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4621"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"180","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"2561-2575","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938d878c28a0473ac919","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4621"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c285145479476","mniswId":"16867","title":"PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS","issn":"0033-4553","eissn":"1420-9136","documentHash":"77efb86d-ba22-4a9a-b5dd-a0b69acd57ae"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6638af114097076e57a728ec","year":"2023","volume":"180","number":"7","documentHash":"329f1688-9154-453c-ab2c-029f29f3ef12"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Mining induced seismicity location accuracy location uncertainty source location"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059589081"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6638ab094097076e57a6fede","name":"Vladimir","lastName":"Mikhalenko","documentHash":"d1eabec6-1519-413b-b85c-7f63075aeeec"},{"objectId":"6638ab094097076e57a6fedd","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kozachek","documentHash":"f00077a4-f61a-4935-b348-66430380c17d"},{"objectId":"6638ab094097076e57a6fedc","name":"Alexey","lastName":"Ekaykin","documentHash":"420d604e-3412-4e63-ae45-c37c29ac7e09"},{"objectId":"6638ab094097076e57a6fedb","name":"Ekaterina","lastName":"Kornilova","documentHash":"aecdbeb7-2028-43df-aa63-e0b90d3c629c"},{"objectId":"6638ab094097076e57a6feda","name":"Victoria","lastName":"Khomiakova","documentHash":"dcbc18d4-92c3-4d9b-a8d2-a486a5112e31"},{"objectId":"62c8e82875234048057213ee","name":"Ekaterina","lastName":"Rets","uuid":"FFCF7AA0169572444E9A6024793B5E736B46B4EA7279910A7437D97C9E1D34F2B11FAB7ADADFB87492B031C0750278EB5FF8B7A17856C31A93879AF792DADCDE","documentHash":"e52b5a13-03c6-4da1-ba9b-6fc29e232c30"}],"objectId":"6638ab094097076e57a6fed8","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172201","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969724023441?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"How and when glacial runoff is important: Tracing dynamics of meltwater and rainfall contribution to river runoff from headwaters to lowland in the Caucasus Mountains","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"As glacier degradation is intensifying worldwide, understanding how and when glacial runoff is important becomes imperative for economic planning and societal adaptation in response to climate change. This research highlights a probable emergence of new low-flow periods, ranging from one to several weeks, with an anticipated 50–90 % reduction in runoff even in major rivers originating in glacierized mountains by the mid to late 21th century. While the predicted decline in annual and monthly runoff appears moderate for most glaciated regions globally, the emergence of new deglaciation-induced summer low flow periods could create critical “bottle necks” constraining effective water resources management.\n\nIn this study, a nested catchment approach (7.6–2259 km2) in conjunction with an isotopic tracer method (D, 18O), was employed to quantify the seasonal dynamics of snow and glacial meltwater and rainfall contribution to runoff across various scales of river catchments for the underreported Caucasus Mountains. Although the contribution of meltwater was predictably dominant in the headwaters (75–100 %), it still constituted a substantial 50–60 % of river runoff in the lower reaches most of the time from June to September. While the relative capacity for rainwater storage was found to significantly increase with watershed scale, during weeks devoid of noteworthy rainfall, the runoff in river basins with a mere 7 % glaciation basically entirely consists of what is formed in the glacierized headwaters. The glacial runoff was prevalent in the melt component from late July/early August to mid-September: not less than 30–60 % to the total runoff in the headwaters and 30–40 % in the lower reaches.\n\nAn approach is proposed to account for the spatial heterogeneity of stable water isotopic content within snow cover and glacier ice. Sources of uncertainties and soundness of assumptions typically used for isotopic hydrograph separation are discussed with particular consideration given to the study objectives."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c8e82875234048057213ee"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"927","pagesFromTo":"172201","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c8e82875234048057213ee","6638ab094097076e57a6feda","6638ab094097076e57a6fedb","6638ab094097076e57a6fedc","6638ab094097076e57a6fedd","6638ab094097076e57a6fede"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","issn":"0048-9697","documentHash":"536a2e2c-aae7-4edb-84d0-5d817a2d0285"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6638ab094097076e57a6fed9","year":"2024","volume":"927","documentHash":"4c1cd901-e4da-477a-a27c-9c8916fe0c49"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059589197"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba04a","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Czuba","uuid":"3225CC1B7D0D3ABB26A538FEB44AC3F72F40427CDE497F5F961D5963BE41E91CC6CFFD862C16949DC824ED367B2F15BD9C9566B5B71791760C8A6A00C7D1D3DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3387-9336","documentHash":"0103c954-e11f-4c0c-b147-dd2af233b2a1"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b875d","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Janik","uuid":"EE02BD7EB3B5C00771B1C3CFAB36AE04859683CFAFE1C88F73DF3A8938A90E701BA090D8456BDE22DC1520959498EE2F3AB06BD3F63662033AD1DAA20AC11428","orcidId":"0000-0002-5915-9740","documentHash":"4f253406-a100-4d3d-803b-e6715062f991"}],"objectId":"6638a5c54097076e57a6a885","doi":"10.24425/ppr.2024.149208","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/130679/2024-PPR-05.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"In Memoriam Professor Aleksander Guterch (1936–2023) an outstanding Polish geophysicist and polar researcher","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b875d","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"45","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"81-83","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709439878c28a0473b875d","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479306","mniswId":"16309","title":"Polish Polar Research","issn":"0138-0338","eissn":"2081-8262","documentHash":"b0fa52be-02f9-4991-9f80-9f288f73b726"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6638a5c54097076e57a6a886","year":"2024","documentHash":"16d870c4-2261-4b64-9271-0a38be2e91ca"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059589390"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6636827840970750edb052f1","name":"Anna","lastName":"Krztoń-Maziopa","documentHash":"138bc6f0-22ae-4110-bbcd-6b560d1d8f40"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b78fc","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Mrokowska","uuid":"636A3DA215291C1A0EA508E0E58EB0F691CFAD76743086AB5B5EFE99C0F4E04721F2A9A94FF6280DA2B9FD763F37A8656FF39E02ACCEBEE7158E85350635DCEB","orcidId":"0000-0002-3135-7315","documentHash":"7312b744-ebc7-41f4-960c-40ab6a6faddd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"6636827840970750edb052ee","doi":"10.1016/j.dib.2024.110101","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S235234092400074X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Laboratory data on dynamics of microplastic particles sinking in seawater with dispersed xanthan gum and kappa-carrageenan and rheological properties of these dispersions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a dataset comprising measurements of the sinking dynamics of microplastics settling in artificial seawater (AS) and in dispersions of polymers in seawater: xanthan gum, kappa-carrageenan, and their mixtures in two concentrations: 0.5 g/L and 1 g/L.

Among the several factors that affect the flood extent, the effect of fluvial dynamics is not clearly recognized so far. Fluvial dynamics play an important role in shaping the patterns and magnitudes of water flow and sediment transport in riverine environments, that consequently affect flood extent. By conducting a scoping review, this paper aims to show how the river's hydrological processes and channel morphology impact floods and flood mapping. To do that, previous studies dealing with flood modeling have been explored to provide a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between fluvial dynamics and flood mapping outcomes. The results showed that morphodynamic variations and sediment transport impact flooding differently depending on local morphological conditions. Some studies indicate that these processes can increase the likelihood of flooding, potentially posing greater risks to nearby areas. Conversely, other research suggests that these morphodynamic variations may help reduce flood occurrences, signaling a nuanced relationship between river morphology and flood dynamics. Additionally, it was found that while bed-load movements significantly influence the synchronization of peak water surface elevation and peak flow times, suspended sediment concentration has minimal impact on the timing and shape of the hydrograph. The results emphasize the crucial role of integrating fluvial hydro-morphodynamics into flood mapping to enhance flood management in riverine environments, contributing to both increased resilience and broader sustainable development goals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","654c523840e3ff4ef3f58233","5e7093f7878c28a0473b414b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"253","pagesFromTo":"104775","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["654c523840e3ff4ef3f58233","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","5e7093f7878c28a0473b414b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779e2","mniswId":"5279","title":"EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS","issn":"0012-8252","documentHash":"12f28f4b-0a7c-4b61-8151-b4641dd4a10b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6639f1474097077c1aa4860a","year":"2024","volume":"253","documentHash":"efab3361-d36c-4cf1-b9ae-8aa8fef87cad"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059592959"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c337969543c72336544149","name":"Motuma ","lastName":" Regasa","uuid":"16D39B99405C260E5EE724B2712D8075C7EF73E21F92FB58256AB5B7E13D4FEBACC5DBA375FAED178428D73468842760BB9D79D3E7932142CBE5541DAFE01D9B","documentHash":"aa31f51a-8437-4915-bd61-c84c21c017ea"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","name":"MICHAEL","lastName":"NONES","uuid":"B4914AC97C650667BF5D9E583192DB532C1DA42B4B9204018194B0AA7AAE1F0EDC0539AC33BF1D2055B6771BBA95B52EDA2B3B3AD73872A38326ED211B1651C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4395-2637","documentHash":"e931d442-a9f1-4ea6-a34d-11a380da3c3b"}],"objectId":"663dd6cb40970729b3fe4507","doi":"10.3389/fenvs.2023.1146346","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1146346/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"SWAT model-based quantification of the impact of land use land cover change on sediment yield in the Fincha watershed, Ethiopia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In recent years, Ethiopia is facing problems due to soil erosion, mainly because of the conversion of natural vegetation into cultivated land to answer to increasing human pressure. Such changes in coverage are fostering soil erosion, which is also affecting dam reservoirs, because of the increasing sediment yield entering the lake. The present study focuses on the Ethiopian Fincha watershed and takes advantage of the potentiality of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, to investigate how land use land cover changes impact soil erosion and the consequent sediment yield entering the Fincha Dam. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated using time series data of stream flow and sediment covering the period 1986-2008, and its performance was evaluated by looking at the coefficient of determination, Nash-Sutcliffe simulation efficiency, and per cent bias. Once validated, the SWAT model was applied to derive sediment yield for the future 30 years, based on forecasted land use land cover conditions. The results show that the mean annual soil loss rate increased from 32.51 t ha−1 in 1989 to 34.05 t ha−1 in 2004, reaching 41.20 t ha−1 in 2019. For the future, a higher erosion risk should be expected, with the annual soil loss rate forecasted to be 46.20 t ha−1 in 2030, 51.19 t ha−1 in 2040, and 53.98 t ha−1 in 2050. This soil erosion means that sediments transported to the Fincha Dam, located at the watershed outlet, increased significantly in the last 30 years (from 1.44 in 1989 to 2.75 mil t in 2019) and will have the same trend in the future (3.08–4.42 mil t in 2020 and 2050, respectively), therefore highly affecting the Fincha reservoir services in terms of reduction of water volume for irrigation and hydroelectric power generation. By providing possible medium/long-term scenarios, the present work can help land planners and decision-makers in developing future land management strategies based on actual projections, eventually aiming to reduce soil erosion at the watershed scale and guarantee the sustainable development of the Fincha region and its key hydraulic infrastructures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

Rock coasts constitute fully erosional environments, yet long-term rates and trends of coastal cliff retreat remain poorly understood. This study adds to the limited number of studies that use cosmogenic isotopes to reconstruct millennial-scale cliff erosion. Cosmogenic 10Be concentrations were measured in 16 rock samples collected across an active 31 m wide granitic Jangsa shore platform in eastern Korea. A geometry-based inverse numerical model was used to simulate 10Be concentrations for various cliff retreat modes, relative sea level curves, and platform downwearing models. The model results were combined with measured concentrations to find the most likely scenario for coastal evolution. Our findings reveal that the shore platform has widened through time and is entirely formed during the Holocene, unlike the previous cosmogenic study in western Korea that attributed the formation of shore platforms to former interglacial periods. The results suggest acceleration in cliff retreat rate from 1.4 mm yr−1 at 7.4 kyr BP to 7.0 mm yr−1 at present. Accelerating cliff erosion may pose a threat to coastal communities, particularly in the context of observed and predicted anthropogenic sea level rise."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61bd55b87523404d4a8fb735"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"472","pagesFromTo":"107291","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663a1d374097077c1aac6e9b","663a1d374097077c1aac6e9c","663a1d374097077c1aac6e9d","61bd55b87523404d4a8fb735","663a1d374097077c1aac6e9e","663a1d374097077c1aac6e9f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d6d","mniswId":"13916","title":"Marine Geology","issn":"0025-3227","eissn":"1872-6151","documentHash":"3e96b51b-b9f9-436d-9424-8bc89e9766e8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"663a1d374097077c1aac6e9a","year":"2024","volume":"472","documentHash":"74eea98e-859e-48e5-b27f-6d03f4ff06d7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059600341"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6645d68c40970708a82eb233","name":"Martin","lastName":"Chadima","documentHash":"d6f60576-00f9-45b9-a7ac-94a4c424cce9"},{"objectId":"602e0dbc9543c7410626eb4b","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Staneczek","uuid":"CEBBC0295A65C3A61B55829F740D12C076D44CCEA72B0CA196E9FADD7230FA917310D4197E88AFDF47FC597301280ACF3A32384CA8AA266BE70D94F04130A189","documentHash":"d010cfe5-d140-43a7-96b0-d66311e8f924"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7f5a","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Junosza-Szaniawski","uuid":"C48CEF41F4571E421C4629F6911AA79132E22A0C242EE059CBA8858B1370E709ACD1C5A3E95904F86634C86639A05322E3E9455F368E8B1466147EF44831E1E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-4957-8837","documentHash":"f8041c94-1d98-41d4-83e9-b7c84463e375"},{"objectId":"5e7092e8878c28a04739f0e0","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Marynowski","uuid":"1A46A9E911DEC094412B8E638F930720895668E9AD696403C7F7ADB1E1BB673B4DB2665D110A90C1118D48A731657F3797D70721374E85CFE56BF149EF2BFAA2","orcidId":"0000-0002-9044-4398","documentHash":"3d779590-09f8-4172-ab81-bb234f20e29c"}],"objectId":"6645d68c40970708a82eb230","doi":"10.1016/j.tecto.2024.230338","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0040195124001409?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Multi-stage tectonic evolution of the Tatra Mts recorded in the para- and ferromagnetic fabrics","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Tatra Mts form the highest part of the Carpathian mountain chain; however, their tectonic and thermal evolution is still debatable. Previous magnetic fabric studies have primarily focused on the crystalline basement and its autochthonous cover. We investigate the magnetic fabrics of Cretaceous marly limestones from a Mesozoic nappe unit and post-thrusting Oligocene shales and mudstones to unravel the most recent tectonic evolution of the Tatra massif. In addition to standard petromagnetic measurements such as the acquisition of the Isothermal Remanent Magnetization or temperature-dependent susceptibility analyses, we investigated the paleotemperature of the Tatra region because high temperatures are known to significantly affect the magnetic mineralogy. The most common minerals in the studied units are paramagnetic phyllosilicates which govern the in-phase Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility. The ferromagnetic fraction is represented by fine-grained magnetite with a minor contribution of hematite. Measured and counted vitrinite reflectances document an eastward increase in maturity, which is also reflected in the magnetite–hematite grain size ratios. Because the paleotemperatures recorded in the Cretaceous rocks follow the same increasing trend as the post-thrusting shales, it appears that both units were affected by a single major thermal event linked presumably to the Late Oligocene/Early Miocene burial. We propose that magnetic fabrics carried by phyllosilicates document the impact of crucial tectonic phases such as Miocene uplift and Cretaceous thrusting, whereas the out-of-phase Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility and Anisotropy of Anhysteretic Remanent Magnetization fabrics most likely record the stress orientation during major burial episodes. Finally, the conspicuous vertical ferromagnetic lineation present in some Cretaceous sites documents the transpression-controlled tectonic regime in the Oligocene–Early Miocene."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602e0dbc9543c7410626eb4b","5e7092e8878c28a04739f0e0"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709431878c28a0473b7f5a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"880","pagesFromTo":"1-19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602e0dbc9543c7410626eb4b","5e709431878c28a0473b7f5a","6645d68c40970708a82eb233","5e7092e8878c28a04739f0e0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798ea","mniswId":"19321","title":"TECTONOPHYSICS","issn":"0040-1951","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"9f63cb9a-9c0e-4130-95a8-fd356130be11"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6645d68c40970708a82eb231","year":"2024","volume":"880","documentHash":"5a656e06-0a96-4ab2-a14c-93c6dcca764e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059600351"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663a1e704097077c1aac9d4c","name":"Eirik","lastName":"Malnes","documentHash":"1bcfd468-cdff-4aea-ae99-23301ea0ff3c"},{"objectId":"663a1e704097077c1aac9d4b","name":"A.

The near-daily (1.57 d mean temporal resolution) maps were used to calculate sea ice coverage for the entire fjord and its parts, namely the main basin and three major bays: Burgerbukta, Brepollen and Samarinvågen. The average length of the sea ice season was 158 d (range: 105–246 d). Drift ice first arrived from the southwest between October and March, and the fast-ice onset was on average 24 d later. The fast ice typically disappeared in June, around 20 d after the last day with drift ice. The average sea ice coverage over the sea ice season was 41 % (range: 23 %–56 %), but it was lower in the main basin (27 %) compared to in the bays (63 %). Of the bays, Samarinvågen had the highest sea ice coverage (69 %), likely due to its narrow opening and its location in southern Hornsund protecting it from the incoming wind-generated waves. Seasonally, the highest sea ice coverage was observed in April for the entire fjord and the bays and in March for the main basin. The 2014/15, 2019/20 and 2021/22 seasons were characterised by the highest sea ice coverage, and these were also the seasons with the largest number of negative air temperature days in October–December. The 2019/20 season was characterised by the lowest mean daily and monthly air temperatures. We observed a remarkable interannual variability in the sea ice coverage, but on a nine-season scale we did not record any gradual trend of decreasing sea ice coverage. These high-resolution data can be used to, e.g. better understand the spatiotemporal trends in the sea ice distribution in Hornsund, facilitate comparison between Svalbard fjords, and improve modelling of nearshore wind wave transformation and coastal erosion."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61bd55b87523404d4a8fb735"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"895-910","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61bd55b87523404d4a8fb735","663a1e704097077c1aac9d4b","663a1e704097077c1aac9d4c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477849","mniswId":"4565","title":"Cryosphere","issn":"1994-0416","eissn":"1994-0424","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"b3eaeb1b-4cd1-4827-a8bd-35e8822e76d8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"663a1ef64097077c1aacb509","year":"2024","volume":"2","number":"18","doi":"","documentHash":"661f16c5-cd3e-437d-86b5-6943578c0d92"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059601113"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb66c","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Litvinov","documentHash":"bc903e3c-768c-4f32-ae7b-11c4e0e6ee16"},{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb66b","name":"Yurii","lastName":"Otruba","documentHash":"a373e1cb-d775-4831-b8c8-70bd773203f1"},{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb66a","name":"Oleh","lastName":"Romanyuk","documentHash":"7f333f34-40ac-49e1-9d12-bf00e15f34c2"},{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb669","name":"Yevhenii","lastName":"Brillinh","documentHash":"47f45c36-146e-4228-88ea-058300517599"},{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb668","name":"Yevheniy","lastName":"Nakalov","documentHash":"9d318445-5416-4b7c-8eef-f6935aacdaca"},{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb667","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Romenets","documentHash":"44c2f76b-f830-4982-85b9-38a2bd919074"},{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb666","name":"Viktor","lastName":"Tarasov","documentHash":"0a5a5824-6680-49e9-ae52-d233be0cb0af"},{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb665","name":"Valentyn","lastName":"Maksymchuk","documentHash":"bc14415f-eb97-4999-b43a-7ccffd8199f7"},{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb664","name":"Mykhailo","lastName":"Orlyuk","documentHash":"d8aab64f-4dc8-4854-bf6e-94d0ad83dee0"},{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb663","name":"Viktor","lastName":"Shpyra","documentHash":"4cc29bd7-6b77-4695-bea4-7dae5d12c0b8"},{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb662","name":"Olexandr","lastName":"Mytrokhyn","documentHash":"9a7c7d05-0e3e-4d07-9d9f-d0e87670c16c"},{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb661","name":"Mariya","lastName":"Bakarzhiyeva","documentHash":"f9e6ed9e-8e9a-45d5-ab89-3137207b1324"},{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb660","name":"Tamara","lastName":"Yegorova","documentHash":"8874a980-6da8-437b-894c-286375642281"},{"objectId":"627dc2a975234056eb6afbc7","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Bakhmutov","uuid":"7059FD3AE9096C82FAA942B8AF10C90EE2792230DC7C6461E41A0CFFDDA266C75F06F8C0B319E5D5CA564C79CAB7D68202774C7E149D0871580D98687BCCFD05","documentHash":"c1071bf8-bbc7-40bb-b846-f91c57011563"}],"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb65e","doi":"10.1007/s11600-023-01190-6","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11600-023-01190-6.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Magnetic field map of the Wilhelm Archipelago shelf zone, West Antarctica","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Antarctic Digital Magnetic Anomaly Project is an international research effort to construct a magnetic map of the continent based on ground, satellite, marine, and aeromagnetic surveys. This paper reports the magnetic mapping of the shelf zone in the SE part of the Wilhelm Archipelago, West Antarctica, based on magnetic surveys conducted with Zodiac boats. A spectacular feature of this area is the strong magnetic anomaly of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) batholith, which was the product of subduction-related Mesozoic–Cenozoic arc magmatism on the former margin of Western Gondwana. We constructed and analyzed a detailed magnetic map of magnetic field anomalies using field observations of rock exposures on the islands and magnetic properties of rocks from laboratory data. The oldest volcanic rocks of Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous age relate to N-NE trending bands of negative magnetic field. The largest feature in the study area is an Upper Cretaceous/Paleogene granodiorite complex that produces a positive magnetic anomaly. Many smaller anomalies are also present over gabbroid bodies of Cretaceous age. Two-dimensional magnetic modeling shows that heterogeneities in the upper crust may have magnetic susceptibilities in the range of 0.005–0.13 SI. Magnetic field anomalies also delineate an orthogonal system of tectonic faults, including the main NE fault along the Penola Strait (sub-parallel to the AP coastline) and four intersecting faults. These fault systems may be associated with different stages of continental margin evolution along the Antarctic Peninsula."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["627dc2a975234056eb6afbc7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"72","pagesFromTo":"1693-1712","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["627dc2a975234056eb6afbc7","663dc85340970729b3fcb660","663dc85340970729b3fcb661","663dc85340970729b3fcb662","663dc85340970729b3fcb663","663dc85340970729b3fcb664","663dc85340970729b3fcb665","663dc85340970729b3fcb666","663dc85340970729b3fcb667","663dc85340970729b3fcb668","663dc85340970729b3fcb669","663dc85340970729b3fcb66a","663dc85340970729b3fcb66b","663dc85340970729b3fcb66c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e09","mniswId":"215","title":"Acta Geophysica","issn":"1895-7455","eissn":"1895-7455","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"020c90c9-42d9-4cda-b1e1-55d7af1c9363"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb65f","year":"2024","volume":"72","documentHash":"e3b5f6e2-e175-48f0-8d3a-92afd8a93c1c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Antarctic Peninsula Wilhelm Archipelago Geophysical survey Magnetic anomalies Crustal studies"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059604151"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c2fcd59543c72336543405","name":"Tesfaye ","lastName":"Senbeta","uuid":"4DD156EBF189A2DF2A17EBB3495718A700D0E06FBB0E0C93A59FA4BFCD6FB7840A21808EB09BABE5A076D4B4349F7ACA50CFD044395891204F38955479EB3D98","documentHash":"1e75a733-8758-4a2f-bb2c-a2d21b410521"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Napiórkowski","uuid":"6AE9EEECF23A9027016CE0A5043569229D6A23680190D0C326173C1E6985FE82CE8B15504F7C20E43EC7B867AD3C2CF79197D909B3D518AC611E0C30D884583C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0273-4193","documentHash":"03e7ee2b-1337-4436-8dc2-d4e7730e5939"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdf","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Karamuz","uuid":"42510623665FE0F9C3E90EFFBE52337DCA2E7F6274643BDAB5CD13591E0EDB68962EF018F363C9A1A8E2C85E685741F5523AFC7B270A7EAEB97A679F3C4E5C7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-7226-7412","documentHash":"3bf44037-d31d-40de-9945-7be966f84232"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af53a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kochanek","uuid":"C58488034FF37B76FD4EE222820FDCF292BACD4A7253416E1B866FBD655E60B2674E031CBD51914F5FC6482D4F4E519CA58E659EAFD9B3F0523C8BE896366892","orcidId":"0000-0001-6631-7383","documentHash":"5f2f6dd5-d225-4c99-988f-874a7d18d004"}],"objectId":"663de40940970729b3ff7b3e","doi":"10.5194/piahs-385-155-2024","publicUri":"https://piahs.copernicus.org/articles/385/155/2024/piahs-385-155-2024.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Modelling human impacts on surface and  subsurface hydrological drought","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The scientists tend to assume that climatic factors are the only drivers in the development of drought.

The present study focuses on a piedmont reach of the Italian Po River and combines Landsat satellite information with hydrological records to investigate changes in sandbars exposure and riparian vegetation coverage, considering the summer period of 1984–2022. Satellite data were handled via Google Earth Engine, looking at common indexes such as the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, which was used to identify temporal variations in wetted channel area, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, considered as a proxy of vegetation coverage variations. Changes in the river hydrology were analysed by looking at the annual minimum water levels, the discharge duration curve, the stage–discharge relationship and the yearly annual water volume. Results suggest that a process of oversimplification is affecting this reach of the Po River, showing how climate change can affect piedmont European watercourses. Indeed, after an initial period where bars tended to be barer and somehow stable over time, in the most recent decade a different trend appeared, with vegetation able to colonize the exposed sandbars more. Using the Po River as an exemplary case study, this work suggests that prolonged dry periods, which are more common in recent decades, might impact large and medium rivers located in temperate climates, favouring the development of vegetation on exposed sandbars, eventually resulting in a less dynamic active channel."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"49","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1632-1652","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","663dda2340970729b3fe8ef3","663dda2340970729b3fe8ef4","663dda2340970729b3fe8ef5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779da","mniswId":"5270","title":"Earth Surface Processes and Landforms","issn":"0197-9337","eissn":"1096-9837","documentHash":"9a9bc84a-ecba-4912-b108-2dc9b40c7f69"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"663dda2340970729b3fe8ef2","year":"2024","volume":"49","number":"5","documentHash":"e24e31ec-8fe2-4d82-9abb-77a3babe740f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059607518"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663dcac740970729b3fce5fb","name":"Ievhen I.","lastName":"Nasiedkin","documentHash":"a39f0c86-3048-4c65-ab13-fffae4c43f47"},{"objectId":"663dcac740970729b3fce5fa","name":"Anastasia V.","lastName":"Sachko","documentHash":"c06c42e2-7822-48b7-aff9-44e711451eda"},{"objectId":"663dcac740970729b3fce5f9","name":"Iryna V.","lastName":"Tsiupa","documentHash":"9fb9eab4-e820-41eb-83cd-ad92446cbfb8"},{"objectId":"6520c2a940e3ff22d3492aea","name":"Kseniia","lastName":"Bondar","uuid":"B4934580E7201C8791EDACE0CD65875D7337A590F63B53A2E17FA46F7A1632CB5D4C4BA90CA145FCDC33C70DD609CE9CE53C0B620EAA9958497DF217016BDDC8","documentHash":"19b3dac3-f483-4398-8c7b-0006767ed244"}],"objectId":"663dcac740970729b3fce5f8","doi":"10.1007/s11600-024-01297-4","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11600-024-01297-4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Pre-war situation with soil pollution in the city of Zaporizhzhia: metallurgical industry center in Ukraine—characterized by magnetic, geochemical and microscopy methods","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Metallurgical industries incorporated into the living environment of the city cause significant enrichment of the topsoil with harmful substances including small size particulate matter, which contains heavy metals and magnetic iron oxides.

Magnetic susceptibility, saturation remanence and anhysteretic ratio of soil samples show strong relationship with heavy metals contents and pollution load index.

A modification to the Gauss-Newton (GN) method is developed to address these issues. The standard GN system for multisource multireceiver FWI is reformulated into an equivalent matrix equation form, with the solution becoming a diagonal matrix rather than a vector as in the standard system. The search direction is transformed from a vector to a matrix by relaxing the diagonality constraint, effectively adding a degree of freedom to the subsurface offset axis. The relaxed system can be explicitly solved with only the inversion of two small matrices that deblur the data residual matrix along the source and receiver dimensions, which simplifies the inversion of the Hessian matrix. When used to solve the extended-source FWI objective function, the extended GN (EGN) method integrates the benefits of model and source extension. The EGN method effectively combines the computational effectiveness of the reduced FWI method with the robustness characteristics of extended formulations and offers a promising solution for addressing the challenges of FWI. It bridges the gap between these extended formulations and the reduced FWI method, enhancing inversion robustness while maintaining computational efficiency. The robustness and stability of the EGN algorithm for waveform inversion are demonstrated numerically."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["626c9f287523406b88d07165"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"89","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"R261-R274","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["626c9f287523406b88d07165"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e1e","mniswId":"7141","title":"GEOPHYSICS","issn":"0016-8033","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"db5aaaff-2c91-48bc-9aac-f0e0378295ca"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66430c3e40970763f21eeefb","year":"2024","volume":"89","number":"3","documentHash":"9e0f6dc1-83f6-4ae9-90a6-821fc46a907c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["optimization full-waveform inversion imaging"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059607646"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6643451340970763f2225deb","name":"Hossein S.","lastName":"Aghamiry","documentHash":"b0e01ee3-1604-4c15-a073-30ed043aaa67"},{"objectId":"6643451340970763f2225dea","name":"Stéphane","lastName":"Operto","documentHash":"365ec5e6-9406-4725-b17c-90dba1bcc724"},{"objectId":"6643451340970763f2225de9","name":"Gaoshan","lastName":"Guo","documentHash":"32d73bd5-f750-4233-b073-fc50455a9b09"},{"objectId":"626c9f287523406b88d07165","name":"Ali","lastName":"Gholami","uuid":"2ECFC5AEAA28B4DAD17F4C5C0367B433AF78932977245DE38DB09A380B3BFA2863C72FB1FB8D83DF61D772FF31E66FC0BF8B853605CF814E843959FE40EB305B","documentHash":"244d54a5-c672-476b-ae86-a8fdf8a92e8d"}],"objectId":"6643451340970763f2225de7","doi":"10.1190/geo2023-0055.1","publicUri":"https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/geo2023-0055.1","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Time-domain extended-source full-waveform inversion: Algorithm and practical workflow","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Extended-source full-waveform inversion (ES-FWI) first computes wavefields with data-driven source extensions such that the simulated data in inaccurate velocity models match the observed counterpart sufficiently well to prevent cycle skipping. Then, the source extensions are minimized to update the model parameters toward the true medium. This two-step workflow is iterated until data and sources are matched. It has been recently indicated that the source extensions are the least-squares solutions of the scattered data-fitting problem. As a result, the source extensions are computed by propagating backward in time the deconvolved data residuals by the damped data-domain Hessian of the scattered data-fitting problem. Estimating these weighted data residuals is the main computational bottleneck of time-domain ES-FWI. To mitigate this burden, we approximate the inverse data-domain Hessian by mono- and multidimensional matching filters with two simulations per source. We implement time-domain ES-FWI with the alternating-direction method of multipliers and total-variation regularization. Moreover, we apply ES-FWI with a multiscale approach involving frequency continuation and layer stripping, with the latter being implemented with an offset-time-dependent weighting operator. In this framework, we further regularize the inversions while mitigating their computational burden by matching the grid interval to the frequency bandwidth. Finally, the overall workflow combines ES-FWI and classical FWI during the early and late stages of the multiscale approach, respectively. We illustrate that the sensitivity of ES-FWI to the accuracy of the approximated inverse data-domain Hessian depends on the complexity of the targeted model, the data anatomy, and the accuracy of the starting model. In the case of the 2004 BP salt model, we determine that the layer stripping is necessary when the inverse data-domain Hessian is approximated by a 2D Gabor matching filter and the starting model is crude, whereas this feature is not necessary with the Marmousi II model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["626c9f287523406b88d07165"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"89","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"R73-R94","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6643451340970763f2225de9","6643451340970763f2225dea","626c9f287523406b88d07165","6643451340970763f2225deb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e1e","mniswId":"7141","title":"GEOPHYSICS","issn":"0016-8033","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"db5aaaff-2c91-48bc-9aac-f0e0378295ca"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6643451340970763f2225de8","year":"2024","volume":"89","number":"2","documentHash":"a6c54a89-17c0-4c91-b5be-1f1100c87d63"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059607698"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663dd86740970729b3fe68b8","name":"Megersa Kebede","lastName":"Leta","documentHash":"b13d1ab8-f46b-4b60-b6b8-2152d79828bc"},{"objectId":"663dd86740970729b3fe68b7","name":"Dereje","lastName":"Adeba","documentHash":"a0015bda-0549-4533-9bdc-25fb78daccb6"},{"objectId":"663dd86740970729b3fe68b6","name":"Julla","lastName":"Kabeto","documentHash":"950c6a50-f666-445e-8e9c-3db41cc1ffc3"},{"objectId":"60c337969543c72336544149","name":"Motuma ","lastName":" Regasa","uuid":"16D39B99405C260E5EE724B2712D8075C7EF73E21F92FB58256AB5B7E13D4FEBACC5DBA375FAED178428D73468842760BB9D79D3E7932142CBE5541DAFE01D9B","documentHash":"aa31f51a-8437-4915-bd61-c84c21c017ea"}],"objectId":"663dd86740970729b3fe68b5","doi":"10.3390/w14121838","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/12/1838/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Groundwater Potential Assessment Using GIS and Remote Sensing Techniques: Case Study of West Arsi Zone, Ethiopia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Groundwater is a crucial source of water supply due to its continuous availability, reasonable natural quality, and being easily diverted directly to the poor community more cheaply and quickly. The West Arsi Zone residents remain surface water dependent due to traditional exploration of groundwater, which is a tedious approach in terms of resources and time. This study uses remote sensing data and geographic information system techniques to evaluate the groundwater potential of the study area. This technique is a fast, accurate, and feasible technique. Groundwater potential and recharge zone influencing parameters were derived from Operational Land Imager 8, digital elevation models, soil data, lithological data, and rainfall data. Borehole data were used for results validation. With spatial analysis tools, the parameters affecting groundwater potential (LULC, soil, lithology, rainfall, drainage density, lineament density, slope, and elevation) were mapped and organized. The weight of the parameters according to percent of influence on groundwater potential and recharge was determined by Analytical Hierarchy Process according to their relative influence. For weights allocated to each parameter, the consistency ratio obtained was 0.033, which is less than 0.1, showing the weight allocated to each parameter is acceptable. In the weighted overlay analysis, from a percent influence point of view, slope, land use/cover, and lithology are equally important and account for 24% each, while the soil group has the lowest percent of influence, which accounts only 2% according to this study. The generated groundwater potential map has four ranks, 2, 3, 4, and 5, in which its classes are Low, Moderate, High, and Very High, respectively, based on its groundwater potential availability rank and class. The area coverage is 9825.84 ha (0.79%), 440,726.49 ha (35.46%), 761,438.61 ha (61.27%), and 30,748.68 ha (2.47%) of the study area, respectively. Accordingly, the western part of district is expected to have very high groundwater potential. High groundwater potential is concentrated in the central and western parts whereas moderate groundwater potential distribution is dominant in the eastern part of the area. The validation result of 87.61% confirms the very good agreement among the groundwater record data and groundwater potential classes delineated."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c337969543c72336544149"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"1838","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663dd86740970729b3fe68b6","663dd86740970729b3fe68b7","60c337969543c72336544149","663dd86740970729b3fe68b8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a9a","mniswId":"20224","title":"Water","issn":"2073-4441","eissn":"2073-4441","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"786ef469-6890-4f82-8160-9f545c27c509"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b95e6940970710ec6f3c46","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"12","documentHash":"39318e1e-5229-40b4-b1a1-5080bfaa0091"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["GIS; remote sensing; groundwater potential assessment; analytical hierarchy processes; weight overlay analysis; West Arsi Zone"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059607886"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663ddb6940970729b3feb5aa","name":"Veysi","lastName":"Kartal","documentHash":"f79133f2-cb93-4513-bd5b-99b81bd6cd82"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","name":"MICHAEL","lastName":"NONES","uuid":"B4914AC97C650667BF5D9E583192DB532C1DA42B4B9204018194B0AA7AAE1F0EDC0539AC33BF1D2055B6771BBA95B52EDA2B3B3AD73872A38326ED211B1651C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4395-2637","documentHash":"e931d442-a9f1-4ea6-a34d-11a380da3c3b"}],"objectId":"663ddb6940970729b3feb5a8","doi":"10.1007/s12665-024-11587-1","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12665-024-11587-1.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Assessment of meteorological, hydrological and groundwater drought in the Konya closed basin, Türkiye","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Water scarcity, and drought in particular, is a major challenge worldwide, causing direct and indirect negative effects on ecological systems and water resources, as well as social and economic aspects of life. Climate change and increasing human pressure are contributing to increasing the likelihood of droughts, impacting regions which were not used to be dry. To address this challenge properly, studies should be performed at a multi-scale level, addressing hydrological and hydrogeological drought. Focusing on the Konya Closed Basin in Türkiye, data derived from nineteen stations were used to analyze drought conditions, looking at multiple meteorological—Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Z Score Index (ZSI), China Z Index (CZI), Modified China Z Index (MCZI)—hydrological—Streamflow Drought Index (SDI), Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI)—and hydrogeological—Standardized Groundwater Level Index (SGI)—assessment indices for different time scales (1, 3, 6,12, 24, 36 and 48 months). The results show that extreme drought (ED) conditions computed by SPI at 1 month (1.9–2.5%) were higher than that of all indices for all stations. Moderate drought occurred at least according to the ZSI-1. It was determined that the percentage of SPI and CZI had greater Extremely, Severely and Moderately Dry events (10.7–13.4% for CZI; 10.7–14.2% for SPI) than those of ZSI and MCZI. On the other part, MCZI has shown fewer total drought events (6.2–10%). Since 2008, extremely dry conditions in the Konya Closed Basin are generally caused by groundwater drought, which is higher than meteorological and hydrological droughts. The results reported in this work might help in better planning drought-resilient strategies in the basin, which will be paramount in light of climate change."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"83","issue":"9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663ddb6940970729b3feb5aa","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477af7","mniswId":"5805","title":"Environmental Earth Sciences","issn":"1866-6280","eissn":"1866-6299","websiteLink":"https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/12665","documentHash":"be821361-558c-4964-bc07-b40bda43ee2f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"663ddb6940970729b3feb5a9","year":"2024","volume":"83","number":"9","documentHash":"13a4fb1d-e64f-46d7-801a-500fca94dd4b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Drought Drought indexes Türkiye Water scarcity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059608335"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6644843c40970771f7186f02","name":"Eero","lastName":"Rinne","documentHash":"c4d954a6-8e0d-4f11-ba2b-6ae674612c7f"},{"objectId":"6644843c40970771f7186f01","name":"Jean-Charles","lastName":"Gallet","documentHash":"c27be672-6548-4921-909c-c142a44477e9"},{"objectId":"6644843c40970771f7186f00","name":"Mari Anne","lastName":"Anne","documentHash":"3c526915-8687-4f5c-a31a-2fc19d1fc5b3"},{"objectId":"6644843c40970771f7186eff","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Salzano","documentHash":"3a0dc803-9061-4a1e-bf0b-693b218d883e"},{"objectId":"6644843c40970771f7186efe","name":"Robert","lastName":"Ricker","documentHash":"f4d45f5d-6c22-4129-92a4-28e5bfb07859"},{"objectId":"6644843c40970771f7186efd","name":"Hannah","lastName":"Vickers","documentHash":"3f5d4af0-738f-4241-9da2-ce419eb6b9d0"},{"objectId":"6644843c40970771f7186efc","name":"Eirik","lastName":"Malnes","documentHash":"db59c4c8-914a-41ee-b2aa-5b370d707f57"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Luks","uuid":"FC0F8C1A25CDF854727B23DAF6DD04D1AD9513696FBFA8C968355CC0EFB6A3BDEB4F2A5DDD1AE5371489624E4D31807972D8B5C54FCC96768719FBBC97225A9F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2287-385X","documentHash":"3f73f8a6-7975-4c35-be1a-579f2ca67494"}],"objectId":"6644843c40970771f7186efb","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.10257050","publicUri":"https://zenodo.org/records/10257050","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"A holistic approach to snow observations and models in Svalbard (Snow 23)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"14-15","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6644843c40970771f7186efc","6644843c40970771f7186efd","6644843c40970771f7186efe","6644843c40970771f7186eff","6644843c40970771f7186f00","5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f","6644843c40970771f7186f01","6644843c40970771f7186f02"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6644825e40970771f7181ac4","title":"SESS REPORT 2023 -

It involves solving a wave propagation problem to estimate model parameters that accurately reproduce the data. Recent trends in FWI have seen a renewed interest in extended methodologies, among which source extension methods leveraging reconstructed wavefields to solve penalty or augmented Lagrangian (AL) formulations have emerged as robust algorithms, even for inaccurate initial models. Despite their demonstrated robustness on synthetic data, challenges remain, such as the lack of a clear physical interpretation and reliance on difficult-to-compute least-squares (LS) wavefields. Moreover, the literature lacks a general and through comparison of these source extension methods with each other and with the standard FWI. This paper is divided into three critical parts. In the first, a novel formulation of these methods is explored within a unified Lagrangian framework. This novel perspective permits the introduction of alternative algorithms that use LS multipliers instead of wavefields. These multiplier-oriented variants appear as regularizations of the standard FWI, are suitable to the time domain, offer tangible physical interpretations, and foster enhanced convergence efficiency. The second part of the paper delves into understanding the underlying mechanisms of these techniques. This is achieved by solving the associated non-linear equations using iterative linearization and inverse scattering methods. The paper provides insight into the role and significance of Lagrange multipliers in enhancing the linearization of the equations. It explains how different methods estimate multipliers or make approximations to increase computing efficiency. Additionally, it presents a new physical understanding of the Lagrange multiplier used in the AL method, highlighting how important it is for improving algorithm performance when compared to penalty methods. In the final section, the paper presents numerical examples that compare different methods within a unified iterative algorithm, utilizing benchmark Marmousi and 2004 BP salt models."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["626c9f287523406b88d07165","6619ee2940e3ff2524a6ff0f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"238","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"109-131","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["626c9f287523406b88d07165","6619ee2940e3ff2524a6ff0f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e1b","mniswId":"7138","title":"GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL","issn":"0956-540X","eissn":"1365-246X","documentHash":"c997c760-a0fe-4c68-8bae-cecdf9eec58d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6643489340970763f2229eff","year":"2024","volume":"238","number":"1","documentHash":"ec75391a-6888-4e58-8b64-b92442f8ccc1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Inverse theory, Numerical approximations and analysis, Seismic tomography, Waveform inversion"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059615191"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6644850140970771f718a4da","name":"Jean-Charles","lastName":"Gallet","documentHash":"88640b7e-eb18-4891-83c3-6c17fdc01f17"},{"objectId":"6644850140970771f718a4d9","name":"Eirik","lastName":"Malnes","documentHash":"a9e6c060-4f39-4223-9d06-2043e3c02ef3"},{"objectId":"6644850140970771f718a4d8","name":"Rosamaria","lastName":"Salvatori","documentHash":"d3014845-a65e-400d-bad9-db9ad98efbc2"},{"objectId":"6644850140970771f718a4d7","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Salzano","documentHash":"fa44dce0-76a3-438b-bf9c-fcdeb9ac3fec"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Luks","uuid":"FC0F8C1A25CDF854727B23DAF6DD04D1AD9513696FBFA8C968355CC0EFB6A3BDEB4F2A5DDD1AE5371489624E4D31807972D8B5C54FCC96768719FBBC97225A9F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2287-385X","documentHash":"3f73f8a6-7975-4c35-be1a-579f2ca67494"}],"objectId":"6644850140970771f718a4d6","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.10260051","publicUri":"https://zenodo.org/records/10260051","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Terrestrial photography applications on the snow cover: developing a data service for monitoring extreme events in Svalbard (PASSES 3)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"16-17","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6644850140970771f718a4d7","6644850140970771f718a4d8","5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f","6644850140970771f718a4d9","6644850140970771f718a4da"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6644825e40970771f7181ac4","title":"SESS REPORT 2023 -

In this context, we design and implement a purely earthquake-based passive seismic survey at the Gerolekas bauxite mining site in Greece. It is a very difficult exploration setting, characterized by rough topography, limited accessibility, and a very complex geotectonic regime. We gather a passive seismic data set consisting of four months of continuous recordings (May to August 2018) from 129 stand-alone 3C seismological stations. We then analyze this data set and extract 848 microearthquakes that will serve as sources for the application of local earthquake tomography (LET) and transient-source seismic interferometry (TSI) by autocorrelation. We apply LET to estimate the 3D P- and S-wave velocity models of the subsurface below the study area and TSI by autocorrelation to retrieve the zero-offset virtual reflection responses below each of the recording stations. The velocity models provide a relatively coarse image of a previously completely unexplored part of the mining concession, whereas the higher-resolution virtual reflection imaging illuminates in detail the different interfaces. We also reprocess three lines of legacy active seismic data that were shot in 2003, using the LET P-wave velocity model for depth migration, and confirm the improvement of seismic imaging. Finally, we evaluate the obtained results using well data and jointly interpret them, extracting useful information on the expected target depths and indicating that earthquake-based passive seismic techniques can be an innovative and environmentally friendly option for mineral exploration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"89","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"WB35-WB56","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66434c0040970763f222d4ca","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","66434c0040970763f222d4cb","66434c0040970763f222d4cc","66434c0040970763f222d4cd","66434c0040970763f222d4ce"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e1e","mniswId":"7141","title":"GEOPHYSICS","issn":"0016-8033","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"db5aaaff-2c91-48bc-9aac-f0e0378295ca"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66434c0040970763f222d4c9","year":"2024","volume":"89","number":"1","documentHash":"e0607d97-ae7c-4a24-b4ee-fdf990b21c23"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["passive seismic earthquake tomography interferometry depth migration"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059615452"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667163d44097074551617e59","name":"Ramona","lastName":"Schneider","documentHash":"53da8432-fbc9-47de-a56e-3fe6e1038a6d"},{"objectId":"667163d44097074551617e58","name":"Daniele","lastName":"Sechi","documentHash":"d48a1487-3ae2-42bd-9ec0-d0632c0ae7e7"},{"objectId":"667163d44097074551617e57","name":"Yunus","lastName":"Baykal","documentHash":"c3cc7c75-e71d-4a29-a10c-1b1b85d32d78"},{"objectId":"667163d44097074551617e56","name":"Martin","lastName":"Chadima","documentHash":"08bd4f0c-5441-4ef9-a731-415a9840d065"},{"objectId":"667163d44097074551617e55","name":"Balázs","lastName":"Bradák","documentHash":"8b13cfde-84b3-451a-b4c9-44ce45f7a33f"},{"objectId":"667163d44097074551617e54","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Stevens","documentHash":"4800d3fc-c73d-4f36-b654-edcdbbff965e"},{"objectId":"5f782a31085dcb410a25e93a","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Niezabitowska-Śliwka","uuid":"D754F46BBAF95B873C362829BCB6AD49CD22BF0173B63D68F2A7D9A6B85F21F6A848A460A9B4714CBBA223E141AB86EE97AD90D2A424B74BCA2DABA9757CD2F3","documentHash":"0388b770-6f07-4be9-8f1f-d6dc7716f702"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"667163d44097074551617e51","doi":"10.1002/jqs.3620","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jqs.3620","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Mineral magnetism and palaeoenvironment recorded in loess in southern England","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Extensive research has focused on the loess deposits in southern England, aiming to unravel their stratigraphic and palaeoenvironmental significance. However, no systematic mineral magnetic study on these deposits has yet been undertaken. Here we address this by investigating the magnetic mineral composition and alignment of loess at two sites in southern England, Lowland Point (LP) on the Lizard Peninsula of Cornwall, and Pegwell Bay (PB) in eastern Kent on the Isle of Thanet. A set of rock magnetic analyses was conducted to understand mineral magnetism within the studied sections. In addition, the primary depositional origin of the magnetic fabrics as well as their overprinting caused by various possible post-depositional processes were examined through anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS). The magnetic mineral composition is similar at both sites, derived from both sedimentary (aeolian) and post-depositional processes. The AMS results show magnetic foliation that varies between the two sites, aligning with the bedding plane, indicating deposition from gravitational dust fall at the PB site, and a stronger wind transport energy at the LP site. Although the magnetic lineation of bulk AMS is relatively weak, there is a noticeable tendency towards alignment in most samples, with flow directions from the SE indicated at both sections if a strong wind is assumed at LP, although with a possible SW direction if a weaker wind is assumed. These observations may imply the preservation of palaeowind directions during dust transport, with a substantial southerly component, which contradicts previous assertions of dominant northerly or northeasterly winds. Indeed, a possible dominant southeasterly wind direction between 25 and 18 ka would suggest a limited influence of katabatic, westerly or polar northeasterly winds during dust transport, and rather may imply the effect of low-pressure systems passing through the English Channel during that period."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"667163d44097074551617e5a","name":"Department of Architecture, Design and

historical buildings constructed between c.1280 AD and 1630 AD in northern Poland.

In total, 28 representative specimens from 16 bricks gave successful archaeointensity determination with category B of results quality. For 25 of them the corrections for anisotropy of thermoremanent magnetization and cooling rate were introduced. A large number of specimens classified as category C (48%) is due to a high value of relative additivity check error d(AC) caused most probably by the presence of multi-domain magnetite. The curvature parameter k exceeds the limit value in 11 specimens. However, in the same sample specimens with k higher than 0.270 have provided very similar values of archaeointensity than those with k below this limit. Corrected data are convergent with the Central European master curve of archaeointensity. The corrections of raw data reduce their dispersion at specimen/sample level in most of sites."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934a878c28a0473a6a38","5e709431878c28a0473b7ebc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b2878c28a0473c1bfc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"72","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"2149-2162","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70934a878c28a0473a6a28","5e70934a878c28a0473a6a38","5e709431878c28a0473b7ebc","5e7094b2878c28a0473c1bfc","667046844097073d001851da","5e709453878c28a0473ba882","5e7092c0878c28a04739bf60"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e09","mniswId":"215","title":"Acta Geophysica","issn":"1895-7455","eissn":"1895-7455","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"020c90c9-42d9-4cda-b1e1-55d7af1c9363"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"663dc85340970729b3fcb65f","year":"2024","volume":"72","documentHash":"e3b5f6e2-e175-48f0-8d3a-92afd8a93c1c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059648724"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6694fa16fdbe830e8642f4bc","name":"Franziska D.

Despite magnetic anomalies in craters being well-documented, their relationship with the magnetic mineral composition of the target and impactites is not always straightforward. Furthermore, the influence of impact shock and post-impact events in the magnetism of natural craters remains elusive. In the Ries crater, Germany, the negative magnetic anomalies are attributed to a reverse polarity remanent magnetization in the impact-melt bearing lithologies. We report new chemical, rock-, and mineral-magnetic data from the shocked basement and impactites, from surface samples, NR73 and SUBO-18 boreholes, and explore how temperature and hydrothermalism may influence the magnetic mineralogy in the crater. We identified shocked, pure magnetite in the basement, and low-cation substituted magnetite in the impactites as the main magnetic carriers. The shocked basement is demagnetized but remains largely unaltered by post-impact hydrothermalism, while the impactites show weak magnetization and are extensively altered by neutral-to-reducing post-impact hydrothermalism. We suggest that the magnetic mineralogy of the demagnetized uplifted basement may contribute significantly to the magnetic anomaly variation, in line with recent findings from the Chicxulub peak-ring."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3d37"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"59","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1577-1609","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6694fa16fdbe830e8642f4ba","6694fa16fdbe830e8642f4bb","5e709328878c28a0473a3d37","6694fa16fdbe830e8642f4bc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e4f","mniswId":"14279","title":"METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE","issn":"1086-9379","eissn":"1945-5100","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"a376e74c-0de4-4909-936c-448ca48d26ae"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6694fa16fdbe830e8642f4b9","year":"2024","volume":"59","number":"7","documentHash":"4b3e3393-d87e-4938-ae43-f4ccfc12271a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059735843"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6694f047fdbe830e86423d0e","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Różycki","documentHash":"6b6b4eb6-bad8-4f98-8f04-dcd486b8878d"},{"objectId":"6694f047fdbe830e86423d0d","name":"Luybov","lastName":"Babiy","documentHash":"5d41f030-fada-48d8-a25c-ecf4ad100235"},{"objectId":"6694f047fdbe830e86423d0c","name":"Borys","lastName":"Chetverikov","documentHash":"5aeaa4f2-f748-4e2e-975c-cc23c896f8a1"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac905","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Oryński","uuid":"A17EA2EE114F671518354F32A8ED76AB1E3A7196F2763C307ADE9326E4BB84E23171FE6093FE73D734C78BDA024BC40ECAD077ADA22A39DF3F641AC6E3CDFCC1","orcidId":"0000-0001-5764-4876","documentHash":"61882f30-20a1-421c-8d64-9698828ead87"}],"objectId":"6694f047fdbe830e86423d0a","doi":"10.3390/rs16132330","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/13/2330/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Methods for Designating Protective Zones of Historical and Cultural Purpose Using Non-Invasive Methods—Two Case Studies for Ukraine and Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Technologies and scientific progress are of major importance in monitoring cultural heritage (CH).

The base of the cooperation is a high-quality, broadband seismic network covering the very centre of Europe: the Eastern Alpine and Western Carpathian Mountain ranges, the Bohemian Massif, and the sedimentary Molasse and Pannonian Basins. In this overview, we focus on the implementation and achieved field goals of PACASE, such as seismic station configuration, general network organization, data availability and access to the dataset. With selected seismological examples, we demonstrate the good usability of the records of earthquake detection, and a first publication attests to the structural imaging capability of the PACASE data.

For instance, the lower seismicity (hence the paucity of data) and the absence of well-defined active fault systems complicate accurately determining seismic source parameters. Northeastern Brazil is a stable continental region exhibiting moderate-size events recorded with significant seismic intensities and provoking the collapse of poorly constructed buildings in the last century. Thus, assessing the seismic hazard is critical for seismic risk mitigation. The seismic hazard depends on three components: source, path, and site, and here, we present the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis of the source component for NE Brazil. Spatial aggregation of earthquake sources outlined four areal seismic zones. A goodness-of-fit test rejected the Gutenberg-Richter model of magnitude frequency distribution in one of the studied seismic zones. For this reason, we estimated the magnitude probability distribution function in that zone using a nonparametric adaptive kernel estimator. In other zones the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude frequency model was applied. In either way of the magnitude probability distribution modelling we considered the upper bound for magnitude equal to 6.6 mR, based on the upper bound of a 95 % confidence interval for the standard normal distribution of palaeoearthquake sizes. Our findings suggests that potentially damaging events are likely to occur, and we cannot neglect chances for the occurrence of earthquakes exceeding 5.2 mR. The calculated mean return periods indicate significantly shorter intervals between consecutive large events than palaeoseismic records."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940d878c28a0473b5881"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"e30716","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66ebdbb8fdbe835f939e88ea","5e70940d878c28a0473b5881","66ebdbb8fdbe835f939e88eb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c2a4","mniswId":"7504","title":"Heliyon","issn":"2405-8440","eissn":"2405-8440","documentHash":"70f70987-7e3b-4241-9b3b-c4bb0901a1ce"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66ebdbb8fdbe835f939e88e9","year":"2024","volume":"10","number":"9","documentHash":"f968fe8f-7823-45e0-91a0-89936c11150c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Seismic hazard Statistical seismology Stable continental region"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059756503"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66ec250efdbe835f93a2d84b","name":"Shinae","lastName":"Lee","documentHash":"9f61ad7b-a4cd-4cb5-a8a1-9ecc2d1fa2d1"},{"objectId":"66ec250efdbe835f93a2d84a","name":"Keewook","lastName":"Yi","documentHash":"e0a09453-1ba4-4df5-993c-77483a150dbf"},{"objectId":"66ec250efdbe835f93a2d849","name":"Martin J.","lastName":"Whitehouse","documentHash":"a4cb4419-18c0-476e-8a71-c18ac10fc1a9"},{"objectId":"66ec250efdbe835f93a2d848","name":"Simon A.","lastName":"Wilde","documentHash":"e6a8ea74-1f87-494e-833f-035e445e5c0a"},{"objectId":"60c34e099543c72336544466","name":"Tanmay","lastName":"Keluskar","uuid":"8AE5F1A2536D8C83680A7A14859615C480FDD13C39E58AB3896FFFB65B57737D91CF2280411726DBB2C6345A04D756E3981AA0C93C9717DD15E46F83FCA5E946","documentHash":"b4835427-df6a-4e6d-815b-bd16f755e348"},{"objectId":"5f5b4028752340073806a9b5","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Dunkley","uuid":"940993469313C143C462EBEBE867F79D6863EFBDE1331E198532EF8D68AC43FB8904B76E77D6AA9CE7E4FEEA534C939BACA51E20A70301995B30B64FB435B839","documentHash":"79aab392-a25b-460c-9588-595aadb97e78"},{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kusiak","uuid":"3052A19F570F1180C90FE5ED9510A53FCEA3A401B154BB701C443A248D410748C9CFEB65CF60BA418E2ECBD9AAFA204B99C32FF77545357BEC09625DF52F2ECD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2042-8621","documentHash":"10e63152-d296-4f9a-9487-cad0a39065f2"}],"objectId":"66ec250efdbe835f93a2d846","doi":"10.1016/j.precamres.2024.107504","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0301926824002171?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The significance of Paleoarchean granitoids from the Saglek Block, Labrador, Canada","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Saglek Block in the Nain Province of northeast Canada is part of the North Atlantic Craton. It comprises Archean gneisses that record magmatic and metamorphic ages between ca. 3.9 and 2.5 Ga. In this study, a grey banded gneiss from Maidmonts Island records an age of 3.72 Ga, which is equated with Uivak I gneisses reported from across the Saglek Block, and contains 3.8 Ga xenocrysts. These rocks were deformed and metamorphosed prior to the intrusion of augen gneiss protoliths on both Maidmonts and Mentzel islands that record U-Pb zircon ages of 3.33 Ga. These rocks are composed of ferroan calc-alkaline granite and granodiorite and were likely generated by partial melting of pre-existing quartzo-feldspathic crust, as attested by the presence of ca. 3.8 Ga xenocrysts. Such augen gneiss was previously classified as ca. 3.6 Ga ‘Uivak II gneiss’, a term we argue should now be abandoned. The final magmatic events recorded on Maidmonts and Mentzel islands took place in the Neoproterozoic with the emplacement of granitic stocks at ca. 2.72 Ga, and sills and dykes at ca. 2.57 Ga. This sequence of magmatic events from the Eoarchean to Neoarchean is very similar to that recorded in the Itsaq Gneiss Complex of southwest Greenland, where, based on the Hf signature, it has been suggested that a change in tectonic environment resulted from the initiation of subduction at ca. 3.2 Ga. Although Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotopic signatures from the ca. 3.33 Ga gneisses have been interpreted in the literature as due to partial melting of Hadean mafic crust, alternatively, they can be generated by partial melting of Eoarchean continental crust in a continental arc setting. We argue this is more consistent with the non-TTG geochemistry of the augen gneisses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c34e099543c72336544466","5f5b4028752340073806a9b5","5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"410","pagesFromTo":"107504","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c34e099543c72336544466","5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6","5f5b4028752340073806a9b5","66ec250efdbe835f93a2d848","66ec250efdbe835f93a2d849","66ec250efdbe835f93a2d84a","66ec250efdbe835f93a2d84b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479360","mniswId":"16452","title":"Precambrian Research","issn":"0301-9268","eissn":"1872-7433","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/precambrian-research/","documentHash":"7b24d2a2-a7cc-493a-8060-37a19f823abc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66ec250efdbe835f93a2d847","year":"2024","volume":"410","documentHash":"8622ac35-db30-4229-a212-61b1d561cf19"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["LabradorZirconU-Pb geochronologyArcheanUivak Gneiss"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059756537"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b","name":"Beata","lastName":"Górka-Kostrubiec","uuid":"837CE8D75E0ECD3E327460670495F33AD004F18316960AEE744DCB63710EB639069A5F2B1240E8B20E21AC170FC616C7D7E9D246798C609ADE31FA8E049F61DF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6337-7583","documentHash":"2b3d8aa3-c2a8-4bd0-a8fa-dd1830c1e138"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3d37","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dudzisz","uuid":"CB8A56D218873215B0E6A697AEF6BDB67E77A2E5004D09D5FE340B63B5E950B6C9AC075B91A33D58B125890908C1F1302B868364040EFD8E73C894FB75E36692","orcidId":"0000-0002-2503-451X","documentHash":"4b3ca7e2-cc85-4331-9dd3-51c0a79c35b6"}],"objectId":"66ea9624fdbe836650ad2512","doi":"10.1016/j.apr.2024.102237","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1309104224002022?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Magnetic properties and load of potentially toxic heavy metals carried by the coarse and fine fractions of indoor dust","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The granulometric fractions of indoor dust, categorized as coarse (grain size of 1.00–0.071 mm) and fine (grain size <0.071 mm), were investigated to discern variations in their magnetic properties and contents of potentially toxic heavy metals. Monthly dust samples were gathered from January 2021 to December 2022 from a private apartment situated on the outskirts of a large urban agglomeration (Warsaw, Poland). To assess indoor dust, several magnetic parameters, including mass-specific magnetic susceptibility, were employed. Portable X-ray fluorescence measurements were utilized to evaluate the enrichment of granulometric fractions in harmful heavy metals. The study reveals a comparable composition of magnetic minerals irrespective of grain size (magnetite and metallic iron), with variations observed in the domain state of magnetic particles (contribution of single-domain (SD) grains to multi-domain (MD)). Seasonal fluctuations were predominantly noted in the distribution of the fine fraction's mass during the warm season (May–July). A notable increase was observed in the fine fraction's mass contribution to the total dust mass compared to the winter season (December and February). The fine fraction was highly enriched in toxic metals, including Pb, Cr, Cu, Mn, Fe, and Sr. Pollution Load index is 6–8 for the fine fraction and 2–8 for the coarse fraction. The increase in the fine fraction mass induces linear changes in magnetic susceptibility, likely associated with the rise in anthropogenic magnetic particles. This finding holds significant implications for human health, as fine particles laden with toxic heavy metals can enter the human respiratory tract causing adverse health effects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3d37","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"102237","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b","5e709328878c28a0473a3d37"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477250","mniswId":"2029","title":"Atmospheric Pollution Research","eissn":"1309-1042","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"77b229b6-5210-4b95-bf75-c6c48cdcdd97"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66ea9624fdbe836650ad2513","year":"2024","volume":"15","number":"9","documentHash":"e909fb64-23b4-4be7-bae3-3fd078a76e1d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059756629"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66ec1eb8fdbe835f93a2ab82","name":"Simon A.","lastName":"Wilde","documentHash":"4b3459d8-2400-4a39-be6a-86135075f69a"},{"objectId":"66ec1eb8fdbe835f93a2ab81","name":"Martin J.","lastName":"Whitehouse","documentHash":"6e2662a2-dcec-4cfb-8d08-e9e43a6e81a3"},{"objectId":"60c34e209543c7233654446b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Król","uuid":"F4CCDC504FCB9988A35A2DC262A795C3DEA9736446D61ABB46DF7E9A2334F5DEBE16EEE8D2D50E35415FE15A6047E93CA0819AB82CE697F4C27085E81ECD5E94","documentHash":"2be8b182-8b34-4168-aa9a-02405d831f37"},{"objectId":"5f5b4028752340073806a9b5","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Dunkley","uuid":"940993469313C143C462EBEBE867F79D6863EFBDE1331E198532EF8D68AC43FB8904B76E77D6AA9CE7E4FEEA534C939BACA51E20A70301995B30B64FB435B839","documentHash":"79aab392-a25b-460c-9588-595aadb97e78"},{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kusiak","uuid":"3052A19F570F1180C90FE5ED9510A53FCEA3A401B154BB701C443A248D410748C9CFEB65CF60BA418E2ECBD9AAFA204B99C32FF77545357BEC09625DF52F2ECD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2042-8621","documentHash":"10e63152-d296-4f9a-9487-cad0a39065f2"}],"objectId":"66ec1eb8fdbe835f93a2ab7f","doi":"10.1016/j.precamres.2024.107416","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0301926824001293?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Eoarchean low δ18O zircon indicates emergent land at 3.73 Ga","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The question as to whether there was emergent land in the Eoarchean (4.0–3.6 Ga) is fundamental not only for understanding Earth’s evolution but also for life itself. Magmatic rocks with isotopically light oxygen can indicate interaction of magmas or their sources with surface water (e.g. meteoric water). Consequently, the presence of such rocks in the geological record of the early Earth can provide an indicator for the emergence of land. Zircon from two Eoarchean orthogneisses in the Tula Mountains, Napier Complex, East Antarctica, show such light isotopic signatures. A ca. 3.75 Ga trondhjemitic gneiss and a ca. 3.55 Ga dioritic gneiss, both with high Y-HREE-Nb-Ta that can be ascribed to the melting of shallow sources at < 1.0 GPa, contain zircon with exceptionally low δ18O values of 1.0–2.7 ‰ (normalized to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water). The lowest δ18O value in zircon previously reported from Paleoarchean orthogneisses is 3.7 ‰ at 3.56 Ga. We show that although the generation of such isotopically light signatures can be achieved through mixing with seawater during a hydrothermal event, the proportion of oxygen from seawater would have to be exceptionally high. In contrast, only a small and more realistic proportion of water with much lighter δ18O, such as that characteristic of meteoric water would be required. These new results, therefore, are consistent with the presence of shallow magmatic or hydrothermal systems involving meteoric water at 3.73 Ga, providing the earliest known evidence for the emergence of land on Earth."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c34e209543c7233654446b","5f5b4028752340073806a9b5","5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"408","pagesFromTo":"107416","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c34e209543c7233654446b","5e7093c1878c28a0473b02c6","66ec1eb8fdbe835f93a2ab81","5f5b4028752340073806a9b5","66ec1eb8fdbe835f93a2ab82"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479360","mniswId":"16452","title":"Precambrian Research","issn":"0301-9268","eissn":"1872-7433","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/precambrian-research/","documentHash":"7b24d2a2-a7cc-493a-8060-37a19f823abc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66ec1eb8fdbe835f93a2ab80","year":"2024","volume":"408","documentHash":"7940406a-2224-4900-aaf2-b38aad07d6d5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Emergent landEarly ArcheanOxygen isotopesZirconEast AntarcticaNapier Complex"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059756676"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66ec1443fdbe835f93a1dc52","name":"R.

Previously, the load has only been modelled by assuming fair weather (FW) conditions, neglecting cloud. As stratiform clouds cover ∼30 % of the Earth's surface, load resistance has been added to represent them, considered to provide semi fair weather (semi-FW) conditions. This increases the GEC timescale by 9 % for stratocumulus, or 33 % for stratus at a lower level. Including mutual capacitance between the outer charged layer and an electrode representing stratocumulus clouds increases the timescale by 35 %, to 8.6 min. These modelled results - the first including the semi-FW aspects - are demonstrated to be consistent with experimentally determined timescales of the real GEC, of between 7 and 12 min, derived from volcanic lightning variations associated with the May 2011 Grímsvötn eruption in Iceland. Accounting for semi-FW circumstances improves the modelled representation of the natural global circuit.

Negative and positive trends were found for the 95th and 5th percentile, respectively, in the O3 data. A weak positive correlation (statistically significant) of 0.33 was calculated between O3 and the temperature averaged from sunrise to sunset during the photoactive part of the year (April–September). Recently, O3 maxima have become less sensitive to temperature changes, reducing the incidence of photochemical smog.

For many winter and spring seasons between 1995 and 2023, the type of photochemical regime could not be accurately determined, making it difficult to build an effective O3 mitigation policy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8c06","5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","5e70940b878c28a0473b5566"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"960","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8c06","5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","5e70940b878c28a0473b5566"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724b","mniswId":"2021","title":"Atmosphere","issn":"2073-4433","eissn":"2073-4433","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e99bbe2c-fe08-4cb7-999f-c3a55335bedc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66ec04b3fdbe835f93a110a9","year":"2024","volume":"15","number":"8","documentHash":"f3a21f23-d20f-464c-9d6b-328fa0e89b9a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["surface ozone; nitrogen oxides; temperature effects; photochemical regimes; trends"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059756946"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"624f9e287523402df09e3128","name":"Nicole","lastName":"Hanselmann","uuid":"A465F7CC1E41E58B641D95DDC749FF2FCF52712840A3BC929F8EC0B1925FEE6C4BBFF8B0D5CBB0FF1F16A50C522CC86B3C04D69EF3FDDDC281FB7F0C6388E13B","documentHash":"a9baacac-31e4-46fb-94df-6bac94a449b8"},{"objectId":"61d3bf387523401fc1107870","name":"Abhishek Bamby","lastName":"Alphonse","uuid":"8572D6B741E7B872E124803CCED875BCC58676B065C012ED8A4AE7B84C9A98DE6E3D81B81FB69DA92BA479EF547E33D8BAE0ADD01AA5B140DDEF0707F3497D5F","documentHash":"4ec7c75f-0e0b-4ab9-b2fb-0f0829c788b7"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Osuch","uuid":"A15CE4704BFC55F4D73C5551A1BF8F722C8079811C8D2926C74DE5E2098F109CCBA98FF443EA760E7212470B8FEC3F616067AD3C9D8E6C8BEC9D2B1C3908DE94","orcidId":"0000-0002-1887-3569","documentHash":"447f1351-672a-4b79-b06d-7741f68786bb"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"C0584C144462F702B3240BEAC5B59EE267B2C41FD0108E80ADE2625711EBE1965DBD3F8183578828BBA3059F994E33D86CACFD8B0B3788616E7BE27271E913B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3393-753X","documentHash":"e1b00415-43de-446c-8e75-68765156a8a8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66f27690fdbe832f68fe5db9","doi":"10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101979","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2214581824003288?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Evaluating potential evapotranspiration methods in a rapidly warming Arctic region, SW Spitsbergen (1983–2023)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Study regions\nHornsund, SW Spitsbergen, Svalbard – area representing atlantic sector of High Arctic\n\nStudy focus\nSvalbard's warming climate significantly alters its hydrological conditions.

Using a daily timescale, PET methods tend to show more similar patterns of changes than using monthly timescales. The changes in PET estimates differ between the models, hence classifying PET methods should consider their sensitivity to meteorological changes. PET estimates were compared with pan measurements at a daily time scale in 2022–2023. The Penman method produced the best results in relation to pan measurements. In other cases, despite a relatively high linear correlation, calibration to local conditions is needed to scale the outcomes and limit biases.

Worldwide, droughts are becoming a very frequent phenomenon, also in regions historically not affected by them, such as Poland. To tackle this phenomenon and investigate its drivers, multiple approaches are being developed, based both on in-situ data and satellite-based observations, also thanks to recent advancements in numerical modelling and spatio-temporal resolution of satellite data. Focusing on the Vistula River basin in Poland, the present research uses selected drought indexes to infer spatio-temporal changes of drought over the last few decades. The opportunity to use the freely-available satellite information, processed with Google Earth Engine, allows for deriving trends at the watershed scale, providing spatially-distributed medium to long-term changes. The present analysis shows that, nowadays, drought is a major concern also for a country that used to be wetter in the past."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"281-291","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"66ed215cfdbe83567c6947bb","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-56093-4","title":"Advances in Hydraulic Research: 40th International School of Hydraulics","year":2024,"isbn":"9783031560927","issn":"2190-5193","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-56093-4.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"2a9534b6-df0e-4fb0-a07f-3f4f85aed07e","publisher":{"objectId":"5ec0043fad49b31cced7e7c2","name":"Springer Nature Switzerland","documentHash":"b2d929ad-51ec-453a-8fd6-c14e269d9e24"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059776563"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66ebcb83fdbe835f939d3832","name":"Dušan","lastName":"Bilčík","documentHash":"f800a790-73f8-4bdc-acf0-ee18383bc7f3"},{"objectId":"66ebcb83fdbe835f939d3831","name":"Radek","lastName":"Klanica","documentHash":"3512c5a5-0963-4e2c-87a2-c7e24f1ac778"},{"objectId":"66ebcb83fdbe835f939d3830","name":"Dušan","lastName":"Majcin","documentHash":"71f07afb-c7ad-4c10-985e-16027090d1f2"},{"objectId":"66ebcb83fdbe835f939d382f","name":"Jozef","lastName":"Madzin","documentHash":"f7a84da9-8a4b-4b02-804e-2deda6fddd10"},{"objectId":"66ebcb83fdbe835f939d382e","name":"Ján","lastName":"Vozár","documentHash":"3fcb0c7c-3a1d-4516-97ef-7855bacbf264"},{"objectId":"66ebcb83fdbe835f939d382d","name":"Lenka","lastName":"Ondrášová","documentHash":"3ef74131-a6c1-4928-ab0d-0af8a6e2ddac"},{"objectId":"66ebcb83fdbe835f939d382c","name":"Vladimír","lastName":"Bezák","documentHash":"95bc1d5c-95bb-46be-953b-3121ae30f29e"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac905","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Oryński","uuid":"A17EA2EE114F671518354F32A8ED76AB1E3A7196F2763C307ADE9326E4BB84E23171FE6093FE73D734C78BDA024BC40ECAD077ADA22A39DF3F641AC6E3CDFCC1","orcidId":"0000-0001-5764-4876","documentHash":"61882f30-20a1-421c-8d64-9698828ead87"}],"objectId":"66ebcb83fdbe835f939d382b","doi":"10.1007/s11600-023-01239-6","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11600-023-01239-6.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Traces of collisional and transtensional processes between the Carpathia and the European platform in the geoelectric image (NE Slovakia and SE Poland)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present the latest magnetotelluric models on profiles in the northeastern part of Slovakia and the southeastern part of Poland.

In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal variations and influencing factors associated with sedimentation in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China, focusing on the flood control storage (FCS) by using measured data from 2003 to 2022. The Sediment Budget Model (SBM) and the Section Topography Method (STM) were used to quantify sedimentation, and Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed to identify key factors affecting sedimentation. Results indicated that sedimentation in the FCS experienced two stages, it initially declined from 2011 to 2016, followed by a gradual increase since then. Sedimentation in the FCS resulted confined to the permanent backwater area, and it displayed a segmented distribution pattern. Although the sedimentation rate showed a decreasing trend since 2013, the heavy flood events in the tributary of the Jialing River could be the major sedimentation risk in the TGR in the future. Sedimentation in the FCS mainly occurred when the flood retention capacity was used during the wet season, and the increase in streamflow and flood retention amount could significantly stimulate sedimentation in the FCS. The current findings not only facilitate the understanding of sedimentation characteristics in the FCS of the TGR, but also benefit sustainable and effective sediment management strategies for other large reservoirs worldwide."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"243","pagesFromTo":"108214","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66fe8debfdbe8364a4052c37","66fe8debfdbe8364a4052c38","66fe8debfdbe8364a4052c39","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","66fe8debfdbe8364a4052c3a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477569","mniswId":"3336","title":"CATENA","issn":"0341-8162","eissn":"1872-6887","documentHash":"3113991c-d094-4765-8d86-d17e29bbe75d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fe8debfdbe8364a4052c36","year":"2024","volume":"243","documentHash":"1b3e4883-64ec-4d00-b5e2-deb109517157"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059776888"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66fe8c38fdbe8364a4050dcc","name":"Yali E.","lastName":"Woyessa","documentHash":"fddc7383-527f-463f-ad54-b99060d61214"},{"objectId":"60c2fcd59543c72336543405","name":"Tesfaye ","lastName":"Senbeta","uuid":"4DD156EBF189A2DF2A17EBB3495718A700D0E06FBB0E0C93A59FA4BFCD6FB7840A21808EB09BABE5A076D4B4349F7ACA50CFD044395891204F38955479EB3D98","documentHash":"1e75a733-8758-4a2f-bb2c-a2d21b410521"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Napiórkowski","uuid":"6AE9EEECF23A9027016CE0A5043569229D6A23680190D0C326173C1E6985FE82CE8B15504F7C20E43EC7B867AD3C2CF79197D909B3D518AC611E0C30D884583C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0273-4193","documentHash":"03e7ee2b-1337-4436-8dc2-d4e7730e5939"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdf","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Karamuz","uuid":"42510623665FE0F9C3E90EFFBE52337DCA2E7F6274643BDAB5CD13591E0EDB68962EF018F363C9A1A8E2C85E685741F5523AFC7B270A7EAEB97A679F3C4E5C7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-7226-7412","documentHash":"3bf44037-d31d-40de-9945-7be966f84232"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af53a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kochanek","uuid":"C58488034FF37B76FD4EE222820FDCF292BACD4A7253416E1B866FBD655E60B2674E031CBD51914F5FC6482D4F4E519CA58E659EAFD9B3F0523C8BE896366892","orcidId":"0000-0001-6631-7383","documentHash":"5f2f6dd5-d225-4c99-988f-874a7d18d004"}],"objectId":"66fe8c38fdbe8364a4050dcb","doi":"10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101812","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2214581824001605?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Impacts of water regulation through a reservoir on drought dynamics and propagation in the Pilica River watershed","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Study region\nThe Pilica River watershed, located in central Poland, is the largest left tributary of the Vistula River basin.\nStudy focus\nThe study aims to assess the impact of human activities on drought dynamics by considering the specific role of the Sulejów Reservoir. Identifying factors contributing to drought development is essential for decision-makers to implement appropriate management measures. The temporal overlap method is used to distinguish between climate and human-driven droughts. The changes in drought propagation are assessed using the time shift method at various accumulation time scales. To assess the spatial distribution of drought, we applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate soil moisture and streamflow response at a spatial scale.\nNew hydrological insights for the region\nThe findings highlight that about 75% of meteorological droughts lead to soil moisture droughts, and about 70% result in hydrological droughts. The results show the contribution of human activities to soil moisture drought (∼25%) and hydrological drought (∼10%), indicating that not all droughts are driven by meteorological factors alone. The key finding suggests a shorter and longer time scale of around 3 and 12 months for soil moisture drought and hydrological drought propagation analysis, respectively. Moreover, the decrease in the duration and severity of drought during 2005–2019 compared to 1997–2004 suggests that the magnitude of the reservoir impact depends on its purpose and operational strategies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fcd59543c72336543405","5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","5e7093b2878c28a0473af53a","5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"53","pagesFromTo":"101812","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c2fcd59543c72336543405","5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdf","5e7093b2878c28a0473af53a","66fe8c38fdbe8364a4050dcc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c885","mniswId":"11386","title":"Journal of Hydrology-Regional Studies","issn":"2214-5818","eissn":"2214-5818","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"a5ad764b-4019-4727-9944-ba272dad9785"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"665d93954097073627d90f42","year":"2024","volume":"53","documentHash":"900751f7-f87d-4804-953d-6abd26dea972"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Human activitiesMeteorological droughtSoil moisture droughtHydrological droughtReservoir operationDrought propagation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059777065"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66fe9347fdbe8364a4057a12","name":"Shuguang","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"e94ef4b5-89b2-4aee-be64-0e67771f951f"},{"objectId":"66fe9347fdbe8364a4057a11","name":"Wentao","lastName":"Xu","documentHash":"25a38c6e-ebc5-4a19-b03e-b78aab568a6a"},{"objectId":"66fe9347fdbe8364a4057a10","name":"Haoyu","lastName":"Han","documentHash":"3aa0ae15-5d51-482b-be5d-50bc0c52cd5f"},{"objectId":"63915a397523402e0617100c","name":"Yiwei","lastName":"Guo","uuid":"ECE17E64F6CB231D071C221D9232D4C729A0B6846E69701DCF13FE1E74E6AE9220D0D4D001148DE4FE9C991ACDA2F2118D974C9EF12C79CA21FB42ED57B0BC0B","documentHash":"e293daa0-f130-4272-b296-607159c7899d"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","name":"MICHAEL","lastName":"NONES","uuid":"B4914AC97C650667BF5D9E583192DB532C1DA42B4B9204018194B0AA7AAE1F0EDC0539AC33BF1D2055B6771BBA95B52EDA2B3B3AD73872A38326ED211B1651C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4395-2637","documentHash":"e931d442-a9f1-4ea6-a34d-11a380da3c3b"}],"objectId":"66fe9347fdbe8364a4057a0f","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-56093-4_13","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-56093-4_13","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Information Entropy Theory-Based Optimizing of Gauge Networks for Hydrological Modelling—A Case Study in the Loess Plateau, China","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Runoff prediction based on error analysis is paramount in flood monitoring and early warning, as well as in flood management. Precipitations are one of the most important input parameters in developing hydrological models to simulate runoff, and they can be represented accurately with a low-cost and well-designed rain gauge network. This study aims to use information entropy to optimize the rain gauge network of the Chabagou Watershed (CW) located in the Loess Plateau, China, as this area is largely affected by extreme precipitation and flood events. There are 13 rain gauges in the CW, and the optimal network is examined by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate the runoff. The results are (i) the gauge network composed of 10 stations performs similarly to the network formed by 13 stations; (ii) the performance of the SWAT model with different rain gauge distribution is stable, but the performance increases with the increase of rain gauge number. In summary, the information entropy-based optimization strategy helps to improve the performance of the gauge network, eventually helping in developing reliable regional hydrological models to be used in flood management."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","63915a397523402e0617100c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"167-181","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63915a397523402e0617100c","66fe9347fdbe8364a4057a10","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","66fe9347fdbe8364a4057a11","66fe9347fdbe8364a4057a12"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"66ed215cfdbe83567c6947bb","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-56093-4","title":"Advances in Hydraulic Research: 40th International School of Hydraulics","year":2024,"isbn":"9783031560927","issn":"2190-5193","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-56093-4.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"2a9534b6-df0e-4fb0-a07f-3f4f85aed07e","publisher":{"objectId":"5ec0043fad49b31cced7e7c2","name":"Springer Nature Switzerland","documentHash":"b2d929ad-51ec-453a-8fd6-c14e269d9e24"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059777373"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66fe8f03fdbe8364a405387c","name":"Sema","lastName":"Ariman","documentHash":"dcdb292d-971b-4f9f-ad5d-106db7854039"},{"objectId":"66fe8f03fdbe8364a405387b","name":"Emre","lastName":"Topcu","documentHash":"7e318d1c-54a4-415b-a2f0-781d92cca3f1"},{"objectId":"66fe8f03fdbe8364a405387a","name":"Veysi","lastName":"Kartal","documentHash":"57fc6a26-8ab3-4758-bbab-847ef4976e9c"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","name":"MICHAEL","lastName":"NONES","uuid":"B4914AC97C650667BF5D9E583192DB532C1DA42B4B9204018194B0AA7AAE1F0EDC0539AC33BF1D2055B6771BBA95B52EDA2B3B3AD73872A38326ED211B1651C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4395-2637","documentHash":"e931d442-a9f1-4ea6-a34d-11a380da3c3b"}],"objectId":"66fe8f03fdbe8364a4053878","doi":"10.1002/hyp.15244","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.15244","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Comparison of different techniques in determining groundwater levels trends in Türkiye","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Groundwater represents one of the largest resources of freshwater in the world.

Although several studies are available in relation to GWL trend analysis via ITA, Mann-Kendall and Sen slope in the literature, there are few IPTA studies conducted. The focus of the study was seven wells across Türkiye over the period 1987–2022. Results demonstrate that there was a downward trend in GWL in all stations annually, regardless of the method. At monthly scale, a decrease was noted, especially in June, August, and September, while seasonally, decreases were seen in autumn and winter. Moreover, it was evident the results of the Sen slope and ITA were compatible, while the IPTA was a useful tool in detecting GWL trends. Identifying and understanding GWL trends is highly valuable in informing groundwater resource managers of critical areas of overuse and other factors affecting groundwater, resulting in preventive interventions to overcome such problems and protect this critical resource."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"38","issue":"8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66fe8f03fdbe8364a405387a","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","66fe8f03fdbe8364a405387b","66fe8f03fdbe8364a405387c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f81","mniswId":"7814","title":"HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES","issn":"0885-6087","documentHash":"395d2d98-3c09-480e-affe-11e439c6dbb0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fe8f03fdbe8364a4053879","year":"2024","volume":"38","number":"8","documentHash":"d8243ddc-7638-45dc-b0be-ce020f4cee2a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059777378"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdd","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Czerwińska","uuid":"D9B7449C9FB28D64D4086462631A03FB2A3E2F0E328F40594AE4A5626B3B9A2D0D1C62129980E7CD3017A0BFAD04A2F6B2D32262D5D18C7E241BBDBFCF24A0A4","orcidId":"0000-0001-8583-5792","documentHash":"30e613a7-a6c2-4eb1-a467-a4eb17faba0d"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Krzyścin","uuid":"6AD82B7788E5B235D0100D0DD2F05BC12ADF71BABA36528B207E410E3E98418CE51603E68A8F27C444B4A2F3FA4B89F000E7F6CE90621B70778345877C60C011","orcidId":"0000-0002-3138-3951","documentHash":"81041a42-caf6-4771-9710-7828de8dacfb"}],"objectId":"66ec0739fdbe835f93a12933","doi":"10.3390/atmos15010080","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/15/1/80/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Signs of Slowing Recovery of Antarctic Ozone Hole in Recent Late Winter–Early Spring Seasons (2020–2023)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Every year since the early 1980s, the ozone hole has appeared in late winter/spring over Antarctica. The ozone hole is expected to disappear due to the observed decrease in the concentration of ozone-depleting substances in the stratosphere, which is enforced by the 1987 Montreal Protocol and its subsequent amendments. However, large ozone holes have appeared four years in a row (2020–2023), which may be a signal that Antarctic ozone repair has stopped. Statistical analyses of ozone hole metrics (hole area, minimum total column ozone, ozone mass deficit, and ozone mass deficit per unit area of the hole) are presented to determine how adding the data from these years changes the ozone recovery pattern. Statistically significant trends in the hole metrics were revealed for the short period (2000–2019) but not for the longer period (2000–2023). The modeled time series of metrics from multiple regressions with standard chemical and dynamic explanatory variables indicate that the recovery has slowed since around 2010. Moreover, a sequence of extreme events (wildfires in Australia in the summer of 2019/2020 and the eruption of the Hunga Tonga volcano in January 2022) may have caused additional ozone losses in Antarctica that masked the repair of polar ozone for a while."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"80","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724b","mniswId":"2021","title":"Atmosphere","issn":"2073-4433","eissn":"2073-4433","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e99bbe2c-fe08-4cb7-999f-c3a55335bedc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65bd4a85409707795692d0cc","year":"2024","volume":"15","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"adf90ad2-33ac-422a-985f-828f16b17161"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["atmospheric ozone; ozone hole; ozone recovery; Antarctica; statistical models"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059783887"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdd","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Czerwińska","uuid":"D9B7449C9FB28D64D4086462631A03FB2A3E2F0E328F40594AE4A5626B3B9A2D0D1C62129980E7CD3017A0BFAD04A2F6B2D32262D5D18C7E241BBDBFCF24A0A4","orcidId":"0000-0001-8583-5792","documentHash":"30e613a7-a6c2-4eb1-a467-a4eb17faba0d"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Krzyścin","uuid":"6AD82B7788E5B235D0100D0DD2F05BC12ADF71BABA36528B207E410E3E98418CE51603E68A8F27C444B4A2F3FA4B89F000E7F6CE90621B70778345877C60C011","orcidId":"0000-0002-3138-3951","documentHash":"81041a42-caf6-4771-9710-7828de8dacfb"}],"objectId":"66ec08b4fdbe835f93a13707","doi":"10.1007/s43630-023-00532-z","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43630-023-00532-z.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Measurements of biologically effective solar radiation using erythemal weighted broadband meters","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we describe conversion factors (CF) for the calculation of biologically effective irradiances (BEI) from erythemal irradiance for three effects: photosynthesis of previtamin D3, psoriasis healing, and inactivation of the SARS-Cov-2 virions. CFs were empirically derived from measurements of spectral solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation during all sky conditions at four mid-latitude sites in the Northern Hemisphere, namely Aosta, Belsk, Reading, and San Diego. These CFs were found to depend on solar zenith angle (SZA) and total column ozone, but are largely independent (within ± 5% for SZA < 60°) of local conditions such as surface albedo, visibility and other local atmospheric patterns. The values of these empirical CFs are consistent with analytical CFs derived with radiative transfer calculations (model FastRT) for clear-sky and overcast conditions. To validate these analytical CFs, one-hour radiant exposures for the three biological effects were calculated from erythemal measurements at Reading between 2012 and 2021 and compared with similar exposures calculated directly from the spectral UV measurements. The two datasets agreed within 10% for SZA < 65°, demonstrating the utility of the conversion method. These results suggest that the proposed analytical CFs can be used with confidence to estimate radiant exposures for the three biological effects from measurements of the UV Index at any northern mid-latitude site."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"479-492","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdd","5e709410878c28a0473b5a96"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479240","mniswId":"16040","title":"PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","issn":"1474-905X","eissn":"1474-9092","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"2fe10a90-1b87-49d7-9d6c-58f6fc8008cb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66ec08b4fdbe835f93a13708","year":"2024","volume":"23","number":"3","documentHash":"b3f7200f-5021-421a-b12d-d122f6da519f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["UV radiation Erythema Vitamin D Psoriasis COVID-19"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059784007"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4db8","name":"Jan","lastName":"Wiszniowski","uuid":"AEA52C3ABBD181EF951F64E380EB7030C5137B70E7D297A700A611560C090BBC1E8841F333851F96FDB8F32827E54E7B4CF224F45D338393BA7F6EE1C2609640","orcidId":"0000-0001-7236-7002","documentHash":"7f416212-1e43-4f3d-872a-f40b46e4b772"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b4621","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Rudziński","uuid":"961F1D1124C7A6EE5547DCF0BA71246B84C544674F664FFB9BCD28552206D586EA78801AAEE81E2CE810AE31B51A5D62634DE5956B6F789EEEEFB590163D028A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2748-4167","documentHash":"6c723c64-3a72-4e29-83d4-a0e99517c798"}],"objectId":"66ed2fb5fdbe83567c6c9323","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.10423417","publicUri":"https://opn.gov.pl/pliki-do-pobrania/otworz/7063b0fc-b6d1-41fd-bd40-6ff416f01232.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Stacja Sejsmologiczna Instytutu Geofizyki PAN w Jaskini Koziarnia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper describes the history of the seismic station located in Ojców National Park.

To provide a clearer depiction of its cross-island orogenic architecture, we apply ambient noise tomography across an east–west linear seismic array in central Taiwan, constructing the first high-resolution 2-D shear velocity model of the upper crust in the region. We observe robust fundamental- and higher-mode Rayleigh waves, with the latter being mainly present in the western Coastal Plain. We develop a multimode double-beamforming method to determine local phase velocities across the array between 2- and 5-s periods. For each location, we jointly invert all available fundamental- and higher-mode phase velocities using a Bayesian-based inversion method to obtain a 1-D model. All 1-D models are then combined to form a final 2-D model from the surface to ∼10 km depth. Our newly developed 2-D model clearly delineates major structural boundaries and fault geometries across central Taiwan, thereby corroborating the previously proposed pro-wedge and retro-wedge models while offering insight into regional seismic hazards."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6669082840e3ff2524b72ec5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"239","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"467-477","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f6970efdbe831edeb0f0d4","66f6970efdbe831edeb0f0d5","66f6970efdbe831edeb0f0d6","66f6970efdbe831edeb0f0d7","6669082840e3ff2524b72ec5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e1b","mniswId":"7138","title":"GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL","issn":"0956-540X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c851e9ec-e6fe-42cb-a670-f1f47a5e1f28"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f6970efdbe831edeb0f0d3","year":"2024","volume":"239","number":"1","documentHash":"589fa1a9-8473-4643-9bd2-7f1f5099e227"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Crustal imaging, Seismic interferometry, Seismic noise, Seismic tomography, Surface waves and free oscillations, Crustal structure"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059794323"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66cdac3ffdbe8324384a6a3e","name":"Christian","lastName":"Hübscher","documentHash":"bafeff52-2910-413a-931e-df0c83f84ff3"},{"objectId":"66cdac3ffdbe8324384a6a3d","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Ponikowska","documentHash":"9bf7ba87-b786-4e9a-95b7-67ed7af57cd8"},{"objectId":"66cdac3ffdbe8324384a6a3c","name":"Sergiy","lastName":"Stovba","documentHash":"9320a4a9-0938-483d-8fc8-45df119dba85"},{"objectId":"66cdac3ffdbe8324384a6a3b","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Mazur","documentHash":"79346ae2-df70-4e2d-a3b6-05e58ebbacfe"},{"objectId":"6619ee2940e3ff2524a6ff14","name":"Quang","lastName":"Nguyen","uuid":"40863097D873BC6F6A58EB906B12FA7C7D201FB8EE40C9CE71931A273EBC7F7F36F6D16B0E0AE790F008E8598EA52E3E3B551D750A0746EEA8A15A9995D8B403","documentHash":"87a0b6f0-0eab-4914-a85d-8791612f89ff"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","name":"Michał","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":"E022BA94789D74D23E41FED253EBD1E58BB96F3392CDEC6D0E204CD5AD5BB297E9ACB8770CC1CF4EBC30E32E3D816EE170453CA93CA7EA60A329F728C6E29B7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7190-3683","documentHash":"350c51a6-178b-45f0-ba79-d8fde881460e"}],"objectId":"66cdac3ffdbe8324384a6a39","doi":"10.5194/se-15-1029-2024","publicUri":"https://se.copernicus.org/articles/15/1029/2024/se-15-1029-2024.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Post-Caledonian tectonic evolution of the Precambrian and Paleozoic platform boundary zone offshore Poland based  on the new and vintage multi-channel reflection seismic data","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The structure of the post-Caledonian sedimentary cover in the transition from the Precambrian to the Paleozoic platforms in the Polish sector of the Baltic Sea is a matter of ongoing debate due to the sparsity of quality seismic data and insufficient well data.

Here we show an optimal seismic data-processing workflow for the selected new BalTec seismic profiles offshore Poland, as well as legacy PGI97 regional seismic data. Due to the acquisition in a shallow-water environment, the processing strategy focused on suppressing multiple reflections and guided waves through a cascaded application of modern multiple elimination approaches. We illustrate the potential of the new and re-processed data for focusing seismic interpretation on the area of the Koszalin Fault. In light of the available data, the Koszalin Fault was the main structure controlling Mesozoic subsidence and Late Cretaceous–Paleocene inversion of the eastern portion of the Mid-Polish Trough offshore Poland. The inversion changed its character from thin- to thick-skinned towards the north, away from the Polish coast. The Koszalin Fault reactivated older structural grain inherited from the time of Devonian continental rifting at the margin of Laurussia. The fault runs obliquely to the Caledonian Deformation Front, the feature that remained inactive since its formation at the Silurian–Devonian transition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","6619ee2940e3ff2524a6ff14"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1029-1046","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6619ee2940e3ff2524a6ff14","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","66cdac3ffdbe8324384a6a3b","66cdac3ffdbe8324384a6a3c","66cdac3ffdbe8324384a6a3d","66cdac3ffdbe8324384a6a3e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454797b7","mniswId":"18696","title":"Solid Earth","issn":"1869-9510","eissn":"1869-9529","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"44ff9b0d-218c-40f5-abf2-0181019fb93e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66cdac3ffdbe8324384a6a3a","year":"2024","volume":"15","number":"8","documentHash":"5d7eec05-3877-4c97-91db-2067fa073939"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059800048"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c337969543c72336544149","name":"Motuma ","lastName":" Regasa","uuid":"16D39B99405C260E5EE724B2712D8075C7EF73E21F92FB58256AB5B7E13D4FEBACC5DBA375FAED178428D73468842760BB9D79D3E7932142CBE5541DAFE01D9B","documentHash":"aa31f51a-8437-4915-bd61-c84c21c017ea"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","name":"MICHAEL","lastName":"NONES","uuid":"B4914AC97C650667BF5D9E583192DB532C1DA42B4B9204018194B0AA7AAE1F0EDC0539AC33BF1D2055B6771BBA95B52EDA2B3B3AD73872A38326ED211B1651C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4395-2637","documentHash":"e931d442-a9f1-4ea6-a34d-11a380da3c3b"}],"objectId":"66fe90eefdbe8364a4054c45","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-56093-4_24","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-56093-4_24","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Evaluating Management Practices to Reduce Sediment Yield in the Fincha Watershed, Ethiopia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ethiopia is experiencing severe environmental issues such as land degradation, which significantly lowers the country’s productivity, with consequent poverty and food insecurity. Based on a predicted Land Use/Land Cover map for the future decade, the study used the well-known Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to evaluate the rate of soil erosion and identify hotspots characterized by a high risk of soil loss, to eventually apply different management practices. Four Best Management Practices (BMPs), namely Contour, Filter strip, Soil/Stone bund, and Terracing were modelled, and their effects were investigated by comparison with a baseline scenario. The mean annual sediment yield expected in 2030 across the Fincha watershed was 46.20 tons per hectare. After applying Contour, Filter Strip, Soil/Stone Bund, and Terracing, the annual sediment yield is expected to reach 11.78, 18.6, 12.90, and 11.17 tons per hectare, respectively, meaning that these BMPs have an efficacy of 74.50%, 59.75%, 72.09%, and 75.82%, respectively. With Terracing being the most and Filter strips the least effective BMP, the simulations proved that BMPs can help in reducing soil loss at the watershed scale."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56","60c337969543c72336544149"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"305-315","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c337969543c72336544149","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d56"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"66ed215cfdbe83567c6947bb","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-56093-4","title":"Advances in Hydraulic Research: 40th International School of Hydraulics","year":2024,"isbn":"9783031560927","issn":"2190-5193","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-56093-4.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"2a9534b6-df0e-4fb0-a07f-3f4f85aed07e","publisher":{"objectId":"5ec0043fad49b31cced7e7c2","name":"Springer Nature Switzerland","documentHash":"b2d929ad-51ec-453a-8fd6-c14e269d9e24"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059800682"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdd","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Czerwińska","uuid":"D9B7449C9FB28D64D4086462631A03FB2A3E2F0E328F40594AE4A5626B3B9A2D0D1C62129980E7CD3017A0BFAD04A2F6B2D32262D5D18C7E241BBDBFCF24A0A4","orcidId":"0000-0001-8583-5792","documentHash":"30e613a7-a6c2-4eb1-a467-a4eb17faba0d"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Krzyścin","uuid":"6AD82B7788E5B235D0100D0DD2F05BC12ADF71BABA36528B207E410E3E98418CE51603E68A8F27C444B4A2F3FA4B89F000E7F6CE90621B70778345877C60C011","orcidId":"0000-0002-3138-3951","documentHash":"81041a42-caf6-4771-9710-7828de8dacfb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67163fcdfdbe8302c760d6c9","doi":"10.3390/rs16203797","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16203797","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Modeling of Biologically Effective Daily Radiant Exposures over Europe from Space Using SEVIRI Measurements and MERRA-2 Reanalysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ultraviolet solar radiation at the Earth’s surface significantly impacts both human health and ecosystems. A biologically effective daily radiant exposure (BEDRE) model is proposed for various biological processes with an analytical formula for its action spectrum. The following processes are considered: erythema formation, previtamin D3 synthesis, psoriasis clearance, and inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 virions. The BEDRE model is constructed by multiplying the synthetic BEDRE value under cloudless conditions by a cloud modification factor (CMF) parameterizing the attenuation of radiation via clouds. The CMF is an empirical function of the solar zenith angle (SZA) at midday and the daily clearness index from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) measurements on board the second-generation Meteosat satellites. Total column ozone, from MERRA-2 reanalysis, is used in calculations of clear-sky BEDRE values. The proposed model was trained and validated using data from several European ground-based spectrophotometers and biometers for the periods 2014–2023 and 2004–2013, respectively. The model provides reliable estimates of BEDRE for all biological processes considered. Under snow-free conditions and SZA < 45° at midday, bias and standard deviation of observation-model differences are approximately ±5% and 15%, respectively. The BEDRE model can be used as an initial validation tool for ground-based UV data."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a96","5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"3797","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdd","5e709410878c28a0473b5a96"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","doi":"10.3390/rs","issn":"2072-4292","eissn":"2072-4292","documentHash":"4455816a-4488-4bca-b561-a29136e7efc7"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059803960"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"670e58a1fdbe8318b371f6b0","name":"Luciano","lastName":"Telesca","documentHash":"2755255f-b019-42aa-bc12-73ba792cbbdd"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba083","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Czechowski","uuid":"976B2A0264185DF857CD5C01AD98E8D626E20E3C1122C6110C5874505B167AC0199768138BC6DF21BA366BD4F6C2B552D9B0D854F3A9DFA1F70C5743B7FD5E91","orcidId":"0000-0002-7806-6726","documentHash":"735452b6-a66f-4d24-93aa-6bea71dd143d"}],"objectId":"670e58a1fdbe8318b371f6ae","doi":"10.3390/math12203197","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/12/20/3197/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Information–Theoretic Analysis of Visibility Graph Properties of Extremes in Time Series Generated by a Nonlinear Langevin Equation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, we examined how the nonlinearity 𝛼\n of the Langevin equation influences the behavior of extremes in a generated time series.

The aim of the study was to determine the effect of pedogenesis on soil properties, mineral and geochemical composition, as well as operationally defined forms of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in Technosols developed on former mine dumps of the Miedziana Góra and Miedzianka former mining areas in south-central Poland. The studied Technosols were weakly developed soils with a simple soil profile comprising (1) C horizons in the subsoil and (2) O and A (or AC) horizons in the topsoil. The pHH2O of soils was 5.5–8.1. High soil pHH2O values were due to occurrence of carbonates (up to 25 %). The highest content of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) was found in O horizons as well as in A and AC horizons including buried A horizon. Soil magnetic susceptibility (χ) was 6.0–171.3 × 10–8 m3 kg−1. In each profile, the highest χ values were typical of A horizons including the buried A horizon. The most common minerals present in all profiles were quartz, kaolinite and mica. There were also admixtures of carbonates (dolomite, calcite), feldspars (orthoclase and albite), jarosite, goethite and traces of Fe sulphides. SEM-EDS analyses showed that soil substrate was subject to transformations of sulphides into Fe oxides. Moreover, pedogenic Cu carbonates were found in pores and on coarse materials. Technosols were enriched in Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Zn, U and Th. The most mobile trace elements in the studied Technosols were Cd, Cu and Zn. Topsoil horizons of the studied soils contained a considerable share of Pb, Cu, Zn and Ni bound with soil organic matter. Arsenic was mostly bound with Fe oxides. First indicators of pedogenesis in the studied Technosols are (1) accumulation of soil organic matter in the topsoil followed by the decrease of soil pH and leaching of carbonates, (2) mineral transformations in the soil substrate (alteration of sulphides into Fe oxides and jarosite; origin of pedogenic Cu carbonates due to crystallization from soil solutions), (3) increase of magnetic susceptibility in the topsoil which may be an effect of atmospheric dust fall out or pedogenic transformation of Fe oxides into the phases with higher magnetic susceptibility and (4) the effect of soil properties, mineral composition and soil organic matter on geochemical forms of potentially toxic trace elements. The novelty value of the study lies in the identification of pedogenic Cu carbonates and the potential effect of soil-forming processes on the increase of topsoil magnetic susceptibility."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"245","pagesFromTo":"108293","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66eaa51efdbe836650af567c","66eaa51efdbe836650af567d","66eaa51efdbe836650af567e","66eaa51efdbe836650af567f","66eaa51efdbe836650af5680","66eaa51efdbe836650af5681","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b","66eaa51efdbe836650af5682","66eaa51efdbe836650af5683"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477569","mniswId":"3336","title":"CATENA","issn":"0341-8162","eissn":"1872-6887","documentHash":"3113991c-d094-4765-8d86-d17e29bbe75d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66c32a6efdbe8314fa3f1a69","year":"2024","volume":"245","documentHash":"1a4d3549-2753-4a9b-b1a8-e4a250160bee"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059822057"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094e7878c28a0473c6935","name":"Agata","lastName":"Goździk","uuid":"774A4CDBCDF6EBB376800A3FBFCC930394AE977968AE754F2BCC37930CF797D04317353729CECA125ACF18ACADC7A96050BAE3F21D8E136DADE488F3094F707B","orcidId":"0000-0002-9474-9500","documentHash":"148c7398-8145-46be-a8fe-ff7c5c51f816"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba04c","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kalinowska","uuid":"890025F10DDB379DAD3AFB6288FA32C35FE12161DDACEB03B40B8B1DD1000CF2D4620D22104AC56D5A2CBE570EB2BDB1C6DD431ECA15E14674F688B3B4953853","orcidId":"0000-0002-6376-2235","documentHash":"d3f95bcd-203c-4cc7-af1e-4155e699fbd2"}],"objectId":"66ed21f1fdbe83567c6949d5","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-56093-4_16","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-56093-4_16","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Photo-Monitoring of Vegetation in Warszawicki Channel—Citizen Science Project Results","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article discusses the significance of vegetation in rivers and channels, focusing on the case of the Warszawicki channel located in central Poland.

This study aims to prioritize structural flood control options using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. Four MCDM methods, namely analytic hierarchy process, technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution, multi-criteria optimization and compromise solution, and Fuzzy-VIKOR are employed to assess and rank the flood control options based on multiple criteria. Field surveys, interviews with local authorities and experts, and on-site assessments of existing flood control structures constituted the primary data collection methods. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of reservoir dams, retention basins, and levees as viable solutions. Conversely, flood control gates and the no-project options were assigned lower priorities. The findings highlight the importance of considering multiple MCDM methods to account for variations in rankings. The study provides valuable insights into the decision-making process for prioritizing flood control options in the study area.

Evidence from a two month ocean glider deployment in early 2019 in the southeast Indian Ocean suggests the impact of mesoscale dynamics on upper-ocean stratification likely affects ocean–atmosphere interaction at MJO scales. Until mid-February, local surface fluxes consistent with a convectively suppressed MJO phase drove near-surface ocean evolution. With the advection of a fresh-core eddy to the glider location in late February, ocean dynamics then becomes an additional driver of this evolution by modulating local stratification and generating a barrier layer of ≈12 m thickness for 10 days. One-dimensional modelling experiments based on the ocean and atmospheric conditions experienced during our sampling period show that the ocean subsurface structure within the eddy induce changes in SST of physical significance for ocean-atmosphere interaction. Moreover, results also suggest that the presence of a thick eddy-induced barrier layer during the MJO suppressed phase modulates the magnitude of temperature anomalies forced by surface fluxes during the following enhanced MJO phase. As eddies are abundant in this area, their dynamics must be considered to correctly represent SST variability for MJO modelling."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709445878c28a0473b9529"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"216","pagesFromTo":"105396","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66ec0e14fdbe835f93a1ab75","66ec0e14fdbe835f93a1ab76","66ec0e14fdbe835f93a1ab77","66ec0e14fdbe835f93a1ab78","5e709445878c28a0473b9529"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477902","mniswId":"4906","title":"DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY","issn":"0967-0645","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"7af0a1d2-01b7-42fb-a4b4-4b5a5137da9d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66ec0e14fdbe835f93a1ab74","year":"2024","volume":"216","documentHash":"f50e4049-1a5a-4c7b-b3e8-301348f6da6d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059825049"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66ec2261fdbe835f93a2bc03","name":"Eleftheria","lastName":"Papadimitriou","documentHash":"0c715a09-3575-4ce4-a621-d36a5a5ca96b"},{"objectId":"66ec2261fdbe835f93a2bc02","name":"Christos","lastName":"Kourouklas","documentHash":"0f1f32bf-3980-43fd-b8bf-9bdb5b81405f"},{"objectId":"66ec2261fdbe835f93a2bc01","name":"Vasileios","lastName":"Karakostas","documentHash":"8080999f-1af1-47f2-8d02-032581846b11"},{"objectId":"66ec2261fdbe835f93a2bc00","name":"Pavlos","lastName":"Bonatis","documentHash":"0b77a137-983a-44ac-843c-252c9de66ab6"},{"objectId":"630830287523404ea24555cf","name":"Anastasios","lastName":"Kostoglou","uuid":"643576C755596C7D6B78E02A9ED6F75F5D105DABF580A3AFAC1C9CE669D7179C99E52F2990420A9F0D4CE6E1E7317B74C3CA7E6F2D2F0465F900330A6EE52146","documentHash":"ad7521d1-8d8c-4197-b6dc-8bc627bab001"}],"objectId":"66ec2261fdbe835f93a2bbfc","doi":"10.26443/seismica.v3i1.1145","publicUri":"https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/download/1145/1447","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Spatiotemporal characteristics and earthquake statistics of the 2020 and 2022 adjacent earthquake sequences in North Aegean Sea (Greece)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The two moderate earthquakes that occurred close and to the north of the North Aegean Trough (NAT) on 26 September 2020 (Mw5.3) and 16 January 2022 (Mw5.4), both followed by aftershock activity, are examined. Seismic activity along the NAT and its parallel branches is continuous and remarkable, with numerous strong instrumental (M≥6.0) earthquakes. Yet, the frequency of moderate (5.0≤M<6.0) earthquakes outside these major fault branches is rather rare and therefore their investigation provides the optimal means to decipher the seismotectonic properties of the broader area. The temporal and spatial proximity of the two seismic excitations from late September of 2020 through early 2022, intrigues for exhaustive investigation of seismic activity with the employment of earthquake relocation techniques, moment tensor solutions and statistical analysis. Our research revealed that this seismic activity purely falls inside the Mainshock – Aftershock type, with fast aftershock decay rates and moderate productivity.

The current study investigates the future effect of four management practices on reducing sediment yield in the Fincha sub-watershed, Ethiopia, by developing a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model over the next three decades (2019–2050). Four best management practices (BMPs) largely applied in the region were considered here. It was found that filter strips can decrease the sediment yield by 65.64 and 58.77, soil or stone bund by 76.37 and 73.07, contour farming by 79.79 and 75.86, and terracing by 84.9% and 76.32% for the years 2019 and 2050, respectively. The impact of these BMPs on various hydrological processes also was evaluated using SWAT. It was found that BMPs are effective in reducing surface runoff and water yield and in increasing groundwater and lateral flows, while they have a reduced effect on evapotranspiration, lateral flow and water yield. The findings presented here point out that all the simulated management practices significantly lower surface runoff and consequently sediment yield across the watershed, but they are not effective enough to reduce soil erosion below a critical threshold that assures crop production. Therefore, to achieve tolerable soil loss, additional soil and land management strategies, such as biological measures and a combination of BMPs are needed and should be considered in future investigations. In summary, the current study offers evidence for managing river basins in semi-arid regions, and can help in ensuring sustainable management of natural resources."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

lithospheric model across Ukrainian Shield from the Carpathians to the Dnieper-Donets Basin and its tectonic interpretation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The SW-NE directed wide-angle reflection-refraction (WARR) SHIELD’21 profile crosses entire width of Ukraine. It targeted the structure of the crust and uppermost mantle in the southwestern part of the East European Craton (EEC), between Carpathians and Voronezh Massif, across Ukrainian Shield and Dnieper-Donets Basin. The ∼660 km-long profile is an extension of the RomUkrSeis profile in Romania and Ukraine. SHIELD’21 experiment, using TEXAN and DATA-CUBE short-period seismic stations, provided high-quality seismic sections from 10 shot points. This allowed construction of a ray-tracing P-wave velocity model, supplemented by Vp/Vs ratio, for the upper part of the lithosphere in the Sarmatia segment of the EEC and constraining geodynamic processes that led to the formation of the Ukrainian Shield and its margins since Archean times.\nThe velocity distribution in the crystalline crust indicates a rather uniform structure, with velocity changing from 6.0 km/s near the surface to 6.8 km/s at the Moho. The entire section shows the lack of a high-velocity lower crust (Vp > 6.8 km/s), presumably resulting from delamination of the primitive mafic lower crust during early evolution of a juvenile continental crust. The seismic boundaries in the upper crust reflect a Paleoproterozoic extensional detachment system below the SW flank of Dnieper-Donets rift basin, initiated in the Devonian. At larger depths, a wide dome of the lower crust with velocities of 6.5–6.8 km/s in the SW-central segment of the profile, probably represents an enormous Palaeoproterozoic(?) granitoid batholith. In the southwesternmost part of the profile, the crystalline crust shows exclusively low velocities. The prominent Moho is undulating and varies in depth between 32 and 50 km. It is underlain by high-velocity bodies (Vp: 8.36–8.40 km/s), against the background of 8.16–8.25 km/s in the mantle. The velocity model corresponds with the anomalies of potential fields and zones of high electric conductivity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b875d","5e709439878c28a0473b875e","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a0473912de"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"892","pagesFromTo":"230540","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["672caba8fdbe836e2141d1df","5e709439878c28a0473b875d","672caba8fdbe836e2141d1e0","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04a","5e709439878c28a0473b875e","672caba8fdbe836e2141d1e1","5e70922e878c28a0473912de","672caba8fdbe836e2141d1e2","672caba8fdbe836e2141d1e3","672caba8fdbe836e2141d1e4","672caba8fdbe836e2141d1e5","672caba8fdbe836e2141d1e6","672caba8fdbe836e2141d1e7","672caba8fdbe836e2141d1e8","672caba8fdbe836e2141d1e9","672caba8fdbe836e2141d1ea","672caba8fdbe836e2141d1eb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798ea","mniswId":"19321","title":"TECTONOPHYSICS","issn":"0040-1951","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"9f63cb9a-9c0e-4130-95a8-fd356130be11"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"672caba8fdbe836e2141d1de","year":"2024","volume":"892","documentHash":"9f7d2e1e-c469-4269-8519-d02c5381feb7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059892658"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6745d65afdbe832eab96895c","name":"Artur","lastName":"Pędziwiatr","documentHash":"59ecb0f2-6437-4f5a-bd2c-9a211190743e"},{"objectId":"6745d65afdbe832eab96895b","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kwasowski","documentHash":"9b6d47f0-9e5f-41d4-b76e-abe6efce2f26"},{"objectId":"6745d65afdbe832eab96895a","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Uzarowicz","documentHash":"87b97157-8904-4430-b582-7e2308c909de"},{"objectId":"6745d65afdbe832eab968959","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Tarnawczyk","documentHash":"be45991e-8ccc-49d6-a836-e1f5cb493b08"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b","name":"Beata","lastName":"Górka-Kostrubiec","uuid":"837CE8D75E0ECD3E327460670495F33AD004F18316960AEE744DCB63710EB639069A5F2B1240E8B20E21AC170FC616C7D7E9D246798C609ADE31FA8E049F61DF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6337-7583","documentHash":"2b3d8aa3-c2a8-4bd0-a8fa-dd1830c1e138"}],"objectId":"6745d65afdbe832eab968958","doi":"10.1016/j.catena.2024.108521","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0341816224007185?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Soil-forming factors controlling Technosol formation in historical mining and metallurgical sites in the high-alpine environment of the Tatra Mountains, southern Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Tatra Mountains are a unique Central European alpine ecosystem where the non-anthropogenic soil cover and soil-forming processes are well recognized. However, the Technosols in the area’s high-mountain environment have not been studied in detail to date. Therefore the aim of this study was to identify the most important soil-forming factors controlling the properties of Technosols developed in historical mining and metallurgical sites in the Tatra Mountains of southern Poland active from the 15th Century until the end of the 19th. The present paper is one of the first attempts to study the genetic aspects of high-mountain Technosols in the temperate climatic zone. The study involved determining soil morphology and classification, soil properties, magnetic susceptibility, mineral composition, optical microscopic observations and total concentration of major elements. The studied Technosols were poorly developed soils with simple soil morphology (mainly A horizon in the topsoil and C horizons in the subsoil). There was a high content of rock fragments. The research has shown that the properties of Technosols in the Tatra Mountains were primarily determined by past human activities like mining and metallurgy as well as the type of anthropogenic parent material, which included mining wastes and metallurgical slags and determined soil properties together with mineral and chemical composition. Soil formation was significantly influenced by vegetation which was conditioned by the relief and climatic conditions dependent on altitudinal zonation. Vegetation and plant-derived soil organic matter shaped topsoil properties. The lengthy soil-forming process acting since a few centuries in some Technosols led to the formation of Bw horizons."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"247","pagesFromTo":"108521","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6745d65afdbe832eab968959","6745d65afdbe832eab96895a","6745d65afdbe832eab96895b","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04b","6745d65afdbe832eab96895c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477569","mniswId":"3336","title":"CATENA","issn":"0341-8162","eissn":"1872-6887","documentHash":"3113991c-d094-4765-8d86-d17e29bbe75d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673f5eb8fdbe834f4e14dd50","year":"2024","volume":"247","documentHash":"22565870-02d2-405e-b42e-ca769cdbd772"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Technogenic soilsAlpine environmentSoil-forming factorsSoil genesisHistorical miningHistorical smelting"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059954747"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6745c9b8fdbe832eab95a48a","name":"Moritz F.","lastName":"Lehmann","documentHash":"285181ac-6ab0-4055-8a49-bfb35bef20bc"},{"objectId":"6745c9b8fdbe832eab95a489","name":"Fabio","lastName":"Lepori","documentHash":"05c61682-218c-4e33-a734-d43ba3b0f711"},{"objectId":"6745c9b8fdbe832eab95a488","name":"Kai‐Uwe","lastName":"Hinrichs","documentHash":"ed179c9c-aed9-4f71-8f7e-f95c37eaa7af"},{"objectId":"6745c9b8fdbe832eab95a487","name":"Nathalie","lastName":"Dubois","documentHash":"1069c959-679a-4f7f-bde0-1bb0f75299f5"},{"objectId":"6745c9b8fdbe832eab95a486","name":"Hendrik","lastName":"Vogel","documentHash":"9d27d2b9-9ab3-4ecc-bcc7-b3a9d87f4446"},{"objectId":"6745c9b8fdbe832eab95a485","name":"Lars","lastName":"Wörmer","documentHash":"bc9eb70b-ca01-4ba5-bae5-f401cb8a398a"},{"objectId":"6745c9b8fdbe832eab95a484","name":"Anja S.","lastName":"Studer","documentHash":"a2270d7d-5a0c-48ad-9290-af5899e14edf"},{"objectId":"60de971e9543c72336544649","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Bartosiewicz","uuid":"6038882D53BF8705F7CC73DC0B96D4E94A813F14440B999810EE9A26FF707CA592D37BB5E44D8F3AA399B31C5B3C54C0151658B91A9647C5AD96000BECBE9DD8","documentHash":"1e8cf486-5b86-4b01-8673-5c324044e85f"}],"objectId":"6745c9b8fdbe832eab95a482","doi":"10.1002/lno.12627","publicUri":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/lno.12627","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"First lacustrine application of the diatom-bound nitrogen isotope paleo-proxy reveals coupling of denitrification and N2 fixation in a hyper-eutrophic lake","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Past changes in the input/output, and internal cycling, of bioavailable nitrogen (N) in marine and lacustrine environments can be reconstructed by analyzing the N isotopic composition (δ15N) of organic matter in the sedimentary record. To verify, and eliminate, potential biases of bulk sedimentary δ15N (δ15Nbulk) signatures by diagenetic alteration and external N inputs, we applied, for the first time, the diatom-bound N isotope (δ15Ndb) paleo-proxy to lake sediments. By comparing δ15Nbulk and δ15Ndb in a sedimentary record from eutrophic Lake Lugano (Switzerland), we demonstrate that changing redox conditions influence the degree of N-isotopic alteration of the bulk sediment, emphasizing the need for caution when interpreting δ15Nbulk in paleolimnological studies. Furthermore, in combining δ15Ndb measurements with X-ray fluorescence scanning and state-of-the-art molecular biomarker analyses, we reconstruct nutrient cycling and paleoenvironmental conditions in the lake over the past ~ 125 yr. Coeval with the period of severe eutrophication in Lake Lugano in the 1960s, our proxy data indicate that export production, δ15Ndb, and the concentration of heterocyst glycolipids (a biomarker for N2-fixing cyanobacteria) increased simultaneously. Together, these data suggest that the rise in δ15Ndb is likely the result of enhanced water-column denitrification in response to increased phytoplankton productivity. We hypothesize that greater export production during eutrophication led to anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion as a result of enhanced organic matter remineralization, raising water-column denitrification. Enhanced N loss and remobilization of phosphorous (P) from the sediments under anoxic conditions lowered the N : P ratio in the lake, fostering cyanobacterial N2 fixation in surface waters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

rapidly changing climate in the High Arctic is posing significant challenges to its ecosystem. To better understand the changes, this study uses Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology equipped with a thermal camera to investigate ground and water temperatures in the catchments of southwest Spitsbergen. This approach provides high-resolution, real-time data, offering a detailed understanding of surface temperatures in this remote and harsh environment. Integrating UAV technology with in-situ measurements enables data collection at high spatial and temporal scales, facilitating a thorough analysis of temperature trends and patterns. The research introduces a new processing workflow using open-source packages to create thermal orthomosaics, enhancing the analysis’s accuracy and efficiency. The final developed orthomosaics examine spatial variations in Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Water Surface Temperature (WST) and explore factors influencing them. Additionally, the study investigates thermal patterns in Arctic hydrological systems, such as channels and ponds, allowing for the identification and characterization of flow paths, including groundwater intrusions and surface water mixing, within the catchments. This multidimensional approach aims to provide valuable insights into the complex interactions between cryo-, hydro-, and meteorological dynamics in the High Arctic."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","624f9e287523402df09e3128","5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","61d3bf387523401fc1107870"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"61","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61d3bf387523401fc1107870","5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","624f9e287523402df09e3128"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e46","mniswId":"7228","title":"GIScience & Remote Sensing","issn":"1548-1603","eissn":"1943-7226","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"b0abaf85-e955-4815-b069-c7899f68ebf6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674edf68fdbe832d4f43ef44","year":"2024","volume":"61","number":"1","documentHash":"f0f7bcd7-44fe-4857-a5d5-d9063ff4bbea"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["UAV thermal infrared Arctic Svalbard LST WST"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059992290"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6752bfa0fdbe83525b8fb71a","name":"Iryna V.","lastName":"Tsiupa","documentHash":"ab4f0917-61d8-4595-b7c7-20c1adc1b98a"},{"objectId":"6520c2a940e3ff22d3492aea","name":"Kseniia","lastName":"Bondar","uuid":"B4934580E7201C8791EDACE0CD65875D7337A590F63B53A2E17FA46F7A1632CB5D4C4BA90CA145FCDC33C70DD609CE9CE53C0B620EAA9958497DF217016BDDC8","documentHash":"19b3dac3-f483-4398-8c7b-0006767ed244"}],"objectId":"6752bfa0fdbe83525b8fb718","doi":"10.1007/s10661-024-13194-w","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10661-024-13194-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Long- and short-term pollution effect in megapolis assessed from magnetic and geochemical measurements on soils, tree trunk bark, and air filters","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study identifies factors influencing spatial and temporal variations in magnetic susceptibility and heavy metal content in soils and airborne particulate matter within the Kyiv megapolis, Ukraine, and highlights how source apportionment differs in the long and short run. Topsoil magnetic susceptibility anomalies of > 70 × 10−8 m3kg−1 are observed around old factories. The tree bark magnetic susceptibility map provides a record of industry general low emissions for the last 2–3 decades. The patterns of both spatial distributions confirm that factory emissions dominate the composition of particulate falling on the ground in urban area, with exclusion of streets with heavy traffic. Enhanced concentrations of Cu, Ni, and Zn have been found in urban soils, showing a positive correlation with magnetic susceptibility. Re-suspended road dust dominates temporal variation of particulate matter magnetic susceptibility collected on air filters. The air at busy streets is cleaner in winter, when the street dust gets immobilized by snow cover or freezing. Industries in Kyiv pose no significant effect on air quality; the concentrations of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb are at normal urban level with the exception of the near vicinity to factories. Air in streets with heavy traffic is enriched with Fe and Mn. Principal component analysis reveals different pattern of air pollution for the busy streets and yard areas. Yards are less affected by road dust; thus, contribution of industrial emissions can be distinguished. The results provide context for further quantification of any alterations in ecological state of Kyiv megapolis that may have arisen from socio-economic shocks and direct threats connected to the current war."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6520c2a940e3ff22d3492aea"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"196","issue":"11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6520c2a940e3ff22d3492aea","6752bfa0fdbe83525b8fb71a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b0b","mniswId":"5832","title":"Environmental Monitoring and Assessment","issn":"0167-6369","eissn":"1573-2959","documentHash":"5638a9db-ba18-46d2-a59e-9fa77e068298"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6752bfa0fdbe83525b8fb719","year":"2024","volume":"196","number":"11","documentHash":"f532688d-14cf-45c4-88bb-00f1fa130144"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Magnetic susceptibility Heavy metals Soil Tree trunk bark Air filter Megapolis Kyiv"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060019564"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6565a8224097075e9e4d33f1","name":"Kacper","lastName":"Wojtysiak","documentHash":"6f13db8d-c3b7-46b8-a146-d7f297117ca4"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8d47","name":"Michał","lastName":"Ciepły","uuid":"55334A43A043EB11373AB34E853CA70D5C89C138F89319B047E92DCDF7E6391DAA52D285FC218700A4BA842A407F91161B137ACF390346183AA8F7706CA887DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-6656-9211","documentHash":"ae9317d8-6d1f-400d-bf87-a0639be9389d"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Luks","uuid":"FC0F8C1A25CDF854727B23DAF6DD04D1AD9513696FBFA8C968355CC0EFB6A3BDEB4F2A5DDD1AE5371489624E4D31807972D8B5C54FCC96768719FBBC97225A9F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2287-385X","documentHash":"3f73f8a6-7975-4c35-be1a-579f2ca67494"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af532","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Moskalik","uuid":"7089D643B2594CC57D59DE2700FC187DBB9C4D62E0328B409B12232373FF164ED96D4B648D07CC92EF366549051735987A73E346A7B7CAB38ED8A2FACEA2C173","orcidId":"0000-0002-0615-9528","documentHash":"312a8722-20f8-4f71-88a9-6b2d058d4efe"},{"objectId":"5e7093a8878c28a0473ae842","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Ignatiuk","uuid":"9EA1B68BFBE264C6151BE2FF4B2F409E403C92A47AB8C32FA9B833DA78AE058BAE840A649C2DFEE6EB001C8322EDCD3D4F472711D504138B350A9B5BB1A0B4D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2947-474X","documentHash":"689c4a5a-35e3-46f5-8942-d663e5a89818"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f076","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Jania","uuid":"C5EB10D76EA50D3529F3DC9C2992A8C5F7E2D849C9D7D9F935708AF0DC071EAE0E78B4CC097A628983449DFA5D74AFE7EF77423AC9F51EC4F564270E3363E0FA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8531-7394","documentHash":"4cdf6236-2013-4763-82ca-ac18ab85b8d4"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399421","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Głowacki","uuid":"2B61E3B0977F44ADF5940784DA33545E985A4674A2BE5C1A00602A9709904D6473265D9598959D628CA1FF81ACCF6380FF9FA95FBF4F462A70D671446FDC50E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-5164-0206","documentHash":"fda11004-7277-4981-810d-055b8dabc3a0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6565a8224097075e9e4d33e9","doi":"10.1017/jog.2023.69","publicUri":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0022143023000692","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Seasonal changes in submarine melting mechanisms controlling frontal ablation of Hansbreen, Svalbard","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We describe the annual pattern of frontal ablation driven by submarine melting mechanisms at the Hansbreen terminus: these are reflected in the intensity and spatial distribution of calving events. Analysis of time-lapse images of the Hansbreen front in conjunction with oceanographic and meteorological data shows that calving intensity is driven primarily by seawater temperature. Regression analysis also highlights the importance of air temperature, which we take to be a proxy for surface ablation and subglacial discharge. This, combined with seasonal changes in ice cliff tortuosity and the increasing significance of wave motion outside the ablation season, enabled us to determine seasonal changes in the mechanisms of ice cliff undercutting by submarine melting. While submarine melting controlled by estuarine circulation primarily drives frontal ablation in summer, wave-driven melting at the waterline is more important outside the ablation season. During winter, ice cliff undercutting by melting is suspended by low seawater temperature, negligible subglacial water discharge and sea-ice cover. The most intense frontal ablation, recorded in summer, was related to higher sea temperature and vigorous estuarine circulation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6565a8224097075e9e4d33f1","5e70929e878c28a047399421","5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f","5e7093b2878c28a0473af532"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e7878c28a04739f076","5e70943f878c28a0473b8d47","5e7093a8878c28a0473ae842"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"69","issue":"278","pagesFromTo":"1886 -

Street dust was collected from 149 sampling points distributed among Area 1 (central districts, left bank of the Vistula River, mostly traffic-related pollution) and Area 2&3 (suburb area, mostly residential, right bank of the river). Street dust was investigated before (“all”) and after separating into 5 size-dependent samples: (1–0.8 mm) “0.8”, (0.8–0.6 mm) “0.6”, (0.6–0.4 mm) “0.4”, (0.4–0.2 mm) “0.2”, and (below 0.2 mm) “ < 0.2”. ΣPAH mean concentration was 3.21 mg/kg for Area 1 and 0.89 mg/kg for Area 2&3. ∑BaPTPE values calculated collectively for Area 1&2&3 were observed to be 318.3, 83.5, 131.1, 81.4, 164.3, and 339.7 ng/g for “all”, “0.6”, “0.4”, “0.2”, and “ < 0.2”, respectively. Significant differences in ∑BaPTPE values were observed between fractions and specific areas. The cancer risk levels for children and adults, for all particulate size fractions, were comparable for dermal contact and by ingestion and ranged from 10−5 to 10−4, whereas the cancer risk levels via inhalation always ranged from 10−10 to 10−8. Therefore, inhalation of resuspended street dust is almost negligible compared to other pathways. Environmental implication. Street dust pollution in cities is one of the most important issues in the world and it negatively affects the quality of the environment and people's health. This study contributed to filling the gap in knowledge about the characteristics of PAH contaminants in the subject of the grain size of street dust from Poland and assessing the potential health risks. Therefore, our work has provided new significant information on PAH pollution, methods of measuring PAHs content and assessing the risk to human health, which may be useful to the scientific community, policymakers, and the general public."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8bde"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"47","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8bde","677d278ffdbe833088adafd4","677d278ffdbe833088adafd5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aff","mniswId":"5815","title":"ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH","issn":"0269-4042","eissn":"1573-2983","documentHash":"7a93f80b-6e15-40a4-9106-fdd9f93083fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677d278ffdbe833088adafd3","year":"2024","volume":"47","number":"1","documentHash":"f29b4014-32a5-42a7-a491-564b2b40f472"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Street dust PAH Carcinogenic health risk Particle size distribution Urban air pollution"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060254133"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6717529bfdbe83553de42667","name":"Jonathan","lastName":"Chambers","documentHash":"d3a39ae5-ae42-43e9-8ecc-6b5a7714c89e"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c990","name":"Artur","lastName":"Marciniak","uuid":"5218C630BD00E1D15FDE8DD95D286784DA876E0E8000313F823180BBF748D7DC9F0A8023A1F90AFE9C5AD5782E365D07C763275DF0F9E05D63FA3DF6DD9BDA9E","documentHash":"64902d05-2f25-441a-b4b1-d9cdb1529f5c"},{"objectId":"5e70941b878c28a0473b64e7","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Cader-Marciniak","uuid":"7A38BACB7C777A9FADAF1B8A68B4970B5BA80DDBD4CCF0EBE9C16D0471F10548EAD4DB87DA7AD4FF6805807ADD408A3D47A34577732E4889FC06FDF221763A72","orcidId":"0000-0001-5236-3223","documentHash":"425a380d-bd74-46b6-a645-c4e63c705d45"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Majdański","uuid":"89D7E80830B607723CEFEDCFBDA5FC52ECA8EFD548784730711C4D8752516F3FD892A2BCEDA865B4737074B27716938ACD71EC45855B87BECB169C65C89CD172","orcidId":"0000-0002-8909-4407","documentHash":"0b6165bd-7e9b-4ab0-9954-9e96b9ceabf6"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac905","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Oryński","uuid":"A17EA2EE114F671518354F32A8ED76AB1E3A7196F2763C307ADE9326E4BB84E23171FE6093FE73D734C78BDA024BC40ECAD077ADA22A39DF3F641AC6E3CDFCC1","orcidId":"0000-0001-5764-4876","documentHash":"61882f30-20a1-421c-8d64-9698828ead87"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7d90","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"36354621FD3ACABEE60EEF462A8EA98A21FDBDDFE2F41C0FA82706A86249123537A7CC0F53EE799E15B10290A6D93F9F3038B4C42D65A799F028B12302C313D1","orcidId":"0000-0002-9835-1479","documentHash":"2d1bde9c-ae82-4bd4-bc05-64dd88fbf446"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f402","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Stan-Kłeczek","uuid":"C379F73F845B4CA18EDB428D0D8BB33F9C0FAD008A657170887C5B1972687F8B88AE9383D48CBD027AF79973FD380859CB3EF8187B5D644AA90EFE10627494BC","orcidId":"0000-0003-0757-5926","documentHash":"54b9d6d2-534d-430a-bcfd-d9c9e80c9864"}],"objectId":"6717529bfdbe83553de42661","doi":"10.1016/j.enggeo.2024.107761","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013795224003612","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Four years of landslide observation with anthropogenic loading as an additional trigger - Analysis of seasonal and annual variability of physical parameters","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Determining the structure and evolution of landslides is crucial for geophysical hazard assessment.

Our combined seismic and electrical methods techniques reveal the landslide's susceptibility to environmental factors on both annual and seasonal scales. Additional analysis, including data clustering and remote sensing, identifies three distinct landslide zones with varying vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic influences.

The available scientific literature and key national and regional policies were reviewed. In addition, a desk-research analysis of 22 CE strategic documents of European regions was performed. Applying the aforementioned methods and expert interviews, a set of key 93 indicators was selected within the province’s dominant industries, such as agri-food, industrial processing, mobility and transport, construction and energy. Also, focus was paid to the socio-innovation area. The proposed framework for tracking CE development allows adequate capture of CE’s effects at the regional level.

However, the water level variability in Lake Titicaca (LTWL) still needs to be understood. The fluctuations of LTWL during the 1921–2018 period are investigated using continuous wavelet techniques on high- and low-pass filters of monthly time series, ERA-20C reanalysis, sea surface temperature (SST), and water level. We also built multiple linear regression (MLR) models based on SST indices to identify the main drivers of the LTWL variability. LTWL features annual (12 months), biennial (22–28 months), interannual (80–108 months), decadal (12.75–14.06 years), interdecadal (24.83–26.50 years), and multidecadal (30–65 years) signals. The high- and low-frequency components of the LTWL are triggered by the humidity transport from the lowland toward the Lake Titicaca basin, although different forcings could cause it. The biennial band is associated with SST anomalies over the southeastern tropical Atlantic Ocean that strengthen the Bolivian High-Nordeste Low system. The interannual band is associated with the southern South Atlantic SST anomalies, which modulate the position of the Bolivian High. According to the MLR models, the decadal and interdecadal components of the LTWL can be explained by the linear combination of the decadal and interdecadal variability of the Pacific and Atlantic SST anomalies (r > 0.83, p < 0.05). In contrast, the multidecadal component of the LTWL is driven by the multidecadal component of the North Atlantic SST anomalies (AMO) and the southern South Atlantic SST anomalies. Moreover, the monthly time series of LTWL exhibits four breakpoints. The signs of the first four trends follow the change of phases of the multidecadal component of LTWL, while the fifth trend is zero attributable to the diminished amplitude of the interdecadal component of LTWL."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["66b6d0a8ece3986804420aec"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"5","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67850b24fdbe833b31831305","67850b24fdbe833b31831306","66b6d0a8ece3986804420aec"]},"journal":{"objectId":"64f04bf6cf9a7471b0ea3b2a","mniswId":"30513","title":"Frontiers in Climate","eissn":"2624-9553","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"a08203d3-2c82-40b8-b445-3172c9afacf5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67850b24fdbe833b31831304","year":"2024","volume":"5","documentHash":"595a9582-c84b-43ab-bd95-0d2321bcb889"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060396259"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba083","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Czechowski","uuid":"976B2A0264185DF857CD5C01AD98E8D626E20E3C1122C6110C5874505B167AC0199768138BC6DF21BA366BD4F6C2B552D9B0D854F3A9DFA1F70C5743B7FD5E91","orcidId":"0000-0002-7806-6726","documentHash":"735452b6-a66f-4d24-93aa-6bea71dd143d"}],"objectId":"67851460fdbe833b3183d032","publicUri":"https://ptgeof.pl/?page_id=2631","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"ROMAN TEISSEYRE (1929-2022) Pamięci wielkiego uczonego i niezwykłego człowieka","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba083"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"69","issue":"1-2","pagesFromTo":"75-80","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba083"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a36a","mniswId":"25757","title":"Przegląd Geofizyczny","issn":"0033-2135","eissn":"2544-1655","documentHash":"8710e4b3-8c6d-4b5b-a4a6-e155be9acb44"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67851460fdbe833b3183d033","year":"2024","volume":"69","number":"1-2","documentHash":"26f30c4e-a3ed-479c-92c4-81583f04f908"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060399623"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6545baba40e3ff4ef3f3fee4","name":"Eslam","lastName":"Roshdy Mohamed Mohamed","uuid":"9DCF6C3B957CF29B38CAA5D193F90A7504F09744FAADB74D09E7D97FEE6948B7BA12394FE5199A7792623FDF6B3F8D0FAB27E75EACF735C54944565996FE8931","documentHash":"5002f826-c5eb-47f8-99c0-b1efa5ccc44a"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c990","name":"Artur","lastName":"Marciniak","uuid":"5218C630BD00E1D15FDE8DD95D286784DA876E0E8000313F823180BBF748D7DC9F0A8023A1F90AFE9C5AD5782E365D07C763275DF0F9E05D63FA3DF6DD9BDA9E","documentHash":"64902d05-2f25-441a-b4b1-d9cdb1529f5c"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7f5a","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Junosza-Szaniawski","uuid":"C48CEF41F4571E421C4629F6911AA79132E22A0C242EE059CBA8858B1370E709ACD1C5A3E95904F86634C86639A05322E3E9455F368E8B1466147EF44831E1E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-4957-8837","documentHash":"f8041c94-1d98-41d4-83e9-b7c84463e375"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Majdański","uuid":"89D7E80830B607723CEFEDCFBDA5FC52ECA8EFD548784730711C4D8752516F3FD892A2BCEDA865B4737074B27716938ACD71EC45855B87BECB169C65C89CD172","orcidId":"0000-0002-8909-4407","documentHash":"0b6165bd-7e9b-4ab0-9954-9e96b9ceabf6"}],"objectId":"677e5dbefdbe8372a5edae60","doi":"10.3390/app15020511","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/2/511/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"The First Seismic Imaging of the Holy Cross Fault in the Łysogóry Region, Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Holy Cross Mountains represent an isolated outcrop of Palaeozoic rocks located in the Trans-European Suture Zone, which is the boundary between the Precambrian East European Craton and Phanerozoic mobile belts of South-Western Europe.

Precise data processing, including static corrections and noise attenuation, significantly enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and seismic resolution. Furthermore, the paper discusses various fault imaging techniques with their shortcomings. The data reveal a complex network of intersecting fault strands, confirming general thrust fault geometry of the fault system, that align with the region’s tectonic evolution.

In this study, we analyzed the variations in PG recorded in Ica city, Peru, during the period from March 2018 to December 2022. Our analysis involved a detailed comparison of PG with various meteorological parameters such as rainfall, wind speed and direction, dust storms, dust devils and fog to establish the characteristic PG curve under fair weather conditions (referred to as the standard curve). We identified a significant threshold of 3.5 m/s for strong winds, which helps prevent the influence of sea breeze and dust lifting on PG. Our results showed the impact of 'Paracas' dust storms on PG, which aligns with patterns observed in other arid regions worldwide. Subsequently, we calculated monthly, seasonal, and annual averages of the standard curve which showed a response likely associated with local convective processes on the PG diurnal variation. Furthermore, the seasonal variation of PG reveals higher values during June, July, and August compared to December, January, and February. These differences are attributed to seasonal changes in aerosol concentrations, potentially influenced by biomass-burning activities in Peru. Additionally, we performed a wavelet transform analysis of PG hourly values. We found the periodicities of 1 day, ∼188 days, and 360 days which are related to the diurnal, semiannual and annual periods. During the months between January and March 2018 was found an intense period of ∼45-day likely associated with one of the strongest Madden-Julian Oscillation events.

For instance, information about geologic structure orientation can be incorporated into local anisotropic regularization methods as a valuable tool to stabilize the solution of inverse problems and produce geologically plausible solutions. We introduce a new variational method that uses the alternating direction method of multipliers within an alternating minimization scheme to jointly estimate orientation and model parameters in 2D and 3D inverse problems. Specifically, our approach adaptively integrates recovered information about structural orientation, enhancing the effectiveness of anisotropic Tikhonov regularization in recovering geophysical parameters. The paper also discusses the automatic tuning of algorithmic parameters to maximize the new method’s performance. Our algorithm is tested across diverse 2D and 3D examples, including structure-oriented denoising and trace interpolation. The results indicate that the algorithm is robust in solving the considered large and challenging problems, alongside efficiently estimating the associated tilt field in 2D cases and the dip, strike, and tilt fields in 3D cases. Synthetic and field examples show that our anisotropic regularization method produces a model with enhanced resolution and provides a more accurate representation of the true structures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["626c9f287523406b88d07165"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"89","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"V521-V536","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["626c9f287523406b88d07165","670e63fffdbe8318b373076c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e1e","mniswId":"7141","title":"GEOPHYSICS","issn":"0016-8033","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"db5aaaff-2c91-48bc-9aac-f0e0378295ca"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"670e63fffdbe8318b373076b","year":"2024","volume":"89","number":"6","documentHash":"adf61979-8de5-4582-a2d2-2008cb0bcd65"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["interpolation invasion processing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060497710"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678a3e81fdbe836e84937386","name":"Taras","lastName":"Sumaruk","documentHash":"457de970-04ce-45fb-ae7e-b0275998da6f"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5880","name":"Jan","lastName":"Reda","uuid":"6BCDE584F86CC166B596D3BFF0215DB00162BF33F46A0B67C52E2EB5C521C29E988735A684342D8EEEBF468AADD5497D2BEFF4C9BAF27588EA7C6C38E88F6693","orcidId":"0000-0003-4580-6190","documentHash":"7732ad0d-4da5-427b-bce8-6a7edddf9d3d"}],"objectId":"678a3e81fdbe836e84937385","doi":"10.18524/1810-4215.2024.37.313647","publicUri":"http://oap.onu.edu.ua/article/view/313647/308093","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Diagnostics of the sources of geomagnetic variations for the superstorm of May 10–13, 2024.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents the results of the analysis of magnetospheric-ionospheric sources of geomagnetic variations for the superstorm of May 10–13, 2024.

The studied seismic series comprises earthquakes from 1999 to May 2020 in an area extended three times more than the main rupture length. We parameterized each earthquake by its magnitude, the waiting time for its occurrence, that is, the time since the previous earthquake after which this earthquake occurred, and the epicentral offset from the previous earthquake, that is, the distance of the epicenter of this earthquake from the epicenter of the previous earthquake. After transformation to equivalent dimensions, these three parameters became mutually comparable. The average distance between earthquakes in the space of these three transformed parameters was used to determine the degree of event clustering. We calculated this distance in data windows moving in time, each consisting of 100 events. The average distance exhibited a consistent upward trend from ten to two years before the mainshock. Then, it declined until the mainshock. This precursory up–down signal was highly significant statistically. We showed that the detected time changes of the average distance resulted from the evolution of the earthquake clustering in the space of their parameters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

Geodynamic Monitoring of Poland project (2013–2023)"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Continuous monitoring of natural seismicity in Poland with mobile seismic network has been carried out since 2008. Since September 2013 this task is being realized as a part of the Geodynamic Monitoring of Poland (GMP) project by the Institute of Geophysics of Polish Academy of Sciences and Polish Geological Institute – National Research Institute. The PSG_Sejs_NET network, operating within the project, consists of 39 mobile and 2 permanent stations distributed among the entire area of Poland. Among them, 14 mobile stations are located in the area of Carpathian Mountains where the biggest number of tectonic earthquakes was described and detected in the past. Auxiliary, data from 7 broadband seismometers of the PLSN network is used for earthquake detection. In this paper the catalog of natural seismic events recorded in the period 1.01.2013–31.10.2023 by the stations of PSG_Sejs_NET network is presented. Tectonic earthquakes identified in this period within Polish borders include: 1) 140 events with local magnitudes M L = 0.2–2.7 which occurred in Podhale region (Orawa–Nowy Targ Basin), 2) 2 events with M L = 0.7 and M L = 2.0 recorded in the area of Chochołowska Valley (Tatry Mts), 3) 1 event with M L = 2.7 located near Szczawnica city (Pieniny /Beskid Sądecki Mts), 4) 2 events with M L = 3.3 and M L = 2.9 recorded in the area of Krynica-Zdrój (Beskid Sądecki Mts), 5) 1 event with M L = 1.4 which occurred in the area of Grybów (Beskid Niski Mts / Różnów and Ciężkowice Foothills), 6) 2 events with M L = 1.7 and M L = 2.0 localized in the area of Kamienica village (Gorce Mts). The biggest number of earthquakes was recorded in Podhale, which is the most seismically active region in Poland. The mean seismic activity in Podhale in the period 2013–2023 equals 1.06 event/30 days. Estimated magnitude of completeness for the 2008–2023 Podhale catalog equals M L C = 0.8. Recorded events instrumentally confirm the existence of tectonic seismicity in the Polish part of Carpathian Mountains, where natural earthquakes occurred also in the past. Apart from the mountain ranges already known for hosting tectonic seismicity, natural earthquakes have been identified for the first time in the area of Gorce Mountains. No tectonic earthquakes were recorded in the other regions of Poland with documented seismic history, i.e. Teisseyre’a-Tornquist Zone, Precambrian Platform, Sudetes and Sudeten Foreland. In this work we shortly describe natural seismicity in these regions basing on available historical catalogs and instrumental data. As a result, a map of tectonic earthquakes which occurred in the period 1496–2023 within Polish borders against a background of main geological units and faults is presented."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f3878c28a0473c7b99","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4621","5e70938d878c28a0473ac8f6","5e7093b5878c28a0473af7f3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ad878c28a0473c16bd","5e7093e1878c28a0473b26b5","5e7094ad878c28a0473c16ca","5e70941f878c28a0473b68dd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"72","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"517-531","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938d878c28a0473ac8f6","5e7094f3878c28a0473c7b99","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4621","5e7093b5878c28a0473af7f3","5e7094ad878c28a0473c16bd","5e7094ad878c28a0473c16ca","5e70941f878c28a0473b68dd","5e7093e1878c28a0473b26b5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a36c","mniswId":"25759","title":"Przegląd Geologiczny","issn":"0033-2151","eissn":"2299-002x","websiteLink":"http://www.pgi.gov.pl/oferta-inst/wydawnictwa/czasopisma/przeglad-geologiczny.html","documentHash":"e211009f-fd45-4550-92f4-ba485a1b6af3"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060511996"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c344dd9543c72336544320","name":"Anna","lastName":"Tymińska","uuid":"6E2D5BEA44D40833A03AA7EA1B822A38C0D21B179C216769C50C18D87D4BFBC0178D6758E007654D160EFF106DDA4B2AB44D6B96E37C1C3A743752E9B6FB094B","documentHash":"7fe2165d-2aeb-4a00-9d49-e2ddc902e53f"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af7f3","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Lizurek","uuid":"0D3B4B6C7813E4B24BAA3336AF367C046C74746F1192895992514D1BCC2BCBFEDD64089AF039F487CA381E16D7BBA4802A45BC3DB5492E674896B694C347C496","orcidId":"0000-0002-4801-4888","documentHash":"a1dd7cdb-6b38-4d50-a599-67457a8707a7"}],"objectId":"679b38dffdbe8318b4c95586","doi":"10.1007/s00024-024-03570-5","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00024-024-03570-5.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Reliability of Moment Tensor Inversion for Different Seismic Networks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article investigates the reliability of moment tensor (MT) inversion in time domain with use of first P-wave amplitude, a method used to determine the source mechanisms of earthquakes, across four different seismic networks.

The analysis was performed to assesses how consistency and accuracy of the results depend on different factors like: network configuration, events depth, velocity model, focal mechanism of event and applied noise. The findings highlight the impact of network configuration compared to other variables and data quality on the reliability of moment tensor inversion and provide insights into different factors which have to be considered to enhance MT accuracy.

Existing infrastructure in the Arctic and Antarctica could be used not only to conduct a wide range of physical, geographical, biological, and oceanic studies but also to enable space analogue missions. Commercialization of space as well as plans for colonization of the Moon and Mars initiated a new chapter in development of space technologies toward opening the access for everyone interested. The authors explore existing Polish polar stations as platforms for conducting space analogue research to develop adaptations for extreme environments. The article presents the current state of existing infrastructure in the polar regions, which are unique considering the multiple aspects of future settlement beyond Earth. These include food production, energy supply and storage, smart materials, and new forms of communication. The extensive experience of Polish polar researchers provides a relevant background for crew selection and support in conducting physiological and psychological studies on humans. In conclusion, polar stations can function as simulation laboratories for the new era of space exploration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b00ab","5e709310878c28a0473a23c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"57","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67b49213fdbe835d67ac5699","5e7093bd878c28a0473b00ab","5e709310878c28a0473a23c8","67b49213fdbe835d67ac569a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771c2","mniswId":"1721","title":"Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research","issn":"1523-0430","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"62798114-7fc9-4733-9297-f2274dad80da"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67b49213fdbe835d67ac5698","year":"2025","volume":"57","number":"1","documentHash":"bf39a496-3f52-4c5f-80b7-b183a9d7ded4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Space analogue simulations isolated studies sustainable life"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060547910"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66ec19defdbe835f93a253e6","name":"Déborah","lastName":"Benkort","documentHash":"8ae74b42-3861-44d6-8039-155f9d03aef8"},{"objectId":"66ec19defdbe835f93a253e5","name":"Marlena","lastName":"Szeligowska","documentHash":"c7345bc6-bb2c-47ff-952a-9a498ede6167"},{"objectId":"61c14a387523404d4a912f17","name":"Bernabe","lastName":"Moreno Leveroni","uuid":"36FA6EE05AD27586A36BA1525B92E9AAD5E4F42B9A77DAD6DAB3BCCEAD1532FFCEBDA7C315B2CAFF88513C5875A69EE85865276D9F50BE3B6B707C2A750E40FD","documentHash":"8f6e77cb-f129-4cfb-94a1-14bcf5f9f6e6"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Trudnowska","uuid":"AA053DA780011D48828031E0F546FBA1539476879FBCBDE10F1D8C2B4534A50AA85A7A8306F9B2D9975214D2058F8F1B1DFD9227C2F2DB66C127DBF1C87DABA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3471-6632","documentHash":"6a2cc11c-54aa-4bf9-8692-2ffad1b22811"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af532","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Moskalik","uuid":"7089D643B2594CC57D59DE2700FC187DBB9C4D62E0328B409B12232373FF164ED96D4B648D07CC92EF366549051735987A73E346A7B7CAB38ED8A2FACEA2C173","orcidId":"0000-0002-0615-9528","documentHash":"312a8722-20f8-4f71-88a9-6b2d058d4efe"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6556","name":"Anna","lastName":"Przyborska","uuid":"3E19638CF37846E94B19CA05A0811841DB6D48F6EC3B749702E29490D16228D2D4B22C28801E19E266F269A77C71EB9DBA67EF4072A7D75F687FCDEDF0596439","orcidId":"0000-0002-2791-6372","documentHash":"0e36dfbf-413c-4bd6-8691-415cef190976"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6520","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Błachowiak-Samołyk","uuid":"8C6AD77D97DA3D9D5230CB20B5B200FB76893BFE72A48BE0BAB6068DBB7BD96049B3C885C6414B2EF04BBFB8AFD27AC9468868A23DB7A01FB8AEBEECC4EDAD0F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8076-2168","documentHash":"5036109f-207f-446c-bac6-ec8dd36677f9"}],"objectId":"66ec19defdbe835f93a253e3","doi":"10.5194/bg-21-3617-2024","publicUri":"https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/21/3617/2024/bg-21-3617-2024.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Estimates of carbon sequestration potential in an expanding Arctic fjord (Hornsund, Svalbard) affected by dark plumes of glacial meltwater","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In polar regions, glaciers are retreating onto land, gradually widening ice-free coastal waters, which are known to act as new sinks of atmospheric carbon. However, the increasing delivery of inorganic suspended particulate matter (iSPM) with meltwater might significantly impact their capacity to contribute to carbon sequestration. Here, we present an analysis of satellite, meteorological, and SPM data as well as results of a coupled physical–biogeochemical model (1D GOTM-ECOSMO-E2E-Polar) with a newly implemented iSPM group to show the impact of iSPM on the ecosystem dynamics in a warming polar fjord (Hornsund, European Arctic) with numerous shallow-grounded marine-terminating glaciers. Our results indicate that with a longer melt season (9 d per decade, 1979–2022), the loss of sea ice cover (44 d per decade, 1982–2021) and the formation of new marine habitats after the retreat of marine-terminating glaciers (around 100 km2 in 1976–2022, a 38 % increase in the total area), glacial meltwater has transported increasing loads of iSPM from land (3.7 g m−3 per decade, reconstructed for 1979–2022). The simulated light limitation induced by the iSPM input delayed and decreased the peaks in phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macrobenthos. The newly ice-free areas still markedly contributed to plankton primary and secondary production and carbon burial in sediments (5.1, 2.0, and 0.9 Gg C yr−1, respectively, on average for 2005–2009 in the iSPM scenario). However, these values would have been 5.0, 2.1, and 0.1 Gg C yr−1 higher, respectively, without the iSPM input. Since carbon burial was the least affected by iSPM (a decrease of around 16 %, in comparison to 50 % for plankton primary and secondary production), the impact of marine ice loss and enhanced land–ocean connectivity should be investigated further in the context of carbon fluxes in expanding polar fjords."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

variability of the MERRA-2 radiation budget over Poland in Central Europe","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper discusses the radiation budget and its temporal variability over Poland. The data analysis is based on the MERRA-2 reanalysis for the years 1980–2020. During the last four decades, the enhancement of climate warming has been observed, which coincides with the changes in the radiation budget. Positive and statistically significant trends at the top of the atmosphere (TOA; 0.7 ± 0.2 W/m2/10 year) and on the Earth’s surface (1.5 ± 0.2 W/m2/10 year) radiation budget (net downward flux) are mainly a consequence of changes in the amount of aerosol and greenhouse gases (GHG). According to MERRA-2, the AOD during this period decreased by − 0.19 (at 550 nm), which is 87% of the long-term (1980–2021) mean value (0.22). The reduction of AOD is due mainly to the decline of non-absorbing sulfate particles, which leads to a reduction of single-scattering albedo (SSA) by − 0.008 per decade and Angstrom exponent (AE) by − 0.06 per decade (both trends statistically significant). On the other hand, the GHG concentration increased by 4.9%/10 year and 3%/10 year, respectively, for CO2 and CH4. The total column of water vapor increased (1.3%/10 year), while ozone decreased (− 1%/10 year). Despite the fact that cloud cover and cloud optical depth (COD) decreased (− 1.8%/10 year and − 1.0%/10 year), the impact of cloud on temporal variability radiation budget is small. It can be explained by nearly compensated shortwave (SW) cooling and longwave (LW) heating effects. During the analysis period, near-surface air temperature increased by 2.0 °C. The estimated increase in SW net surface radiation (7.9 W/m2) leads to climate warming by 0.8 °C, which is a consequence mainly of the reduction of aerosol (0.4 °C) and cloud cover (0.2 °C). The impact of the change of SW radiation on air temperature is more pronounced during the warm season, while during the cold, air temperature change is controlled mainly by the variability of air mass advection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","name":"Wydział Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65968ce74097074a390213a1","5e7094b0878c28a0473c1bc7"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6550","5e709489878c28a0473bf377"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70936e878c28a0473a95ab"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b466a","5e709405878c28a0473b5090"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709358878c28a0473a7bd0","65968ce74097074a390213a1","5e70936e878c28a0473a95ab","5e709489878c28a0473bf377","602e093c9543c7410626eacd","5e709405878c28a0473b5090","5e709347878c28a0473a6550","5e7093fc878c28a0473b466a","5e7094b0878c28a0473c1bc7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e09","mniswId":"215","title":"Acta Geophysica","issn":"1895-7455","eissn":"1895-7455","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"020c90c9-42d9-4cda-b1e1-55d7af1c9363"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655b426d409707162ff40642","year":"2023","documentHash":"ba529abc-14fb-45de-92fd-b21a0b7e76dc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Climate change","Radiation budget","Radiative forcing","Aerosol","Cloud","Greenhouse gases","Optical depth","Single-scattering albedo"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060613848"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64afc4944097077ac5c05313","name":"Wenguang","lastName":"Luo","documentHash":"3fdf5f2a-8297-41ca-8aab-0668257f5ba4"},{"objectId":"64afc4944097077ac5c05310","name":"Senlin","lastName":"Zhu","documentHash":"159dd7d9-fc15-42af-ae00-ec8c85ae4982"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","name":"Adam","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"864E3E49A2309C1FB479470AD68682EA3FAB4349A58557B0478C54157BBB2B92E9A4D1252BEC5AB9362F29E198D2892DA7519ED222E344D6630D3217C0FDAF82","orcidId":"0000-0003-0923-7314","documentHash":"25196237-6284-406e-a277-91b7ddef9871"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6437","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Sojka","uuid":"073495857CF13E01195275681F67A79A3968A817DA229A3E551674CE4B5A13D63A1A529AD939BD49C64AE9D95F29F2363CE487F71459B13C87BFD3F26B2FBFDC","orcidId":"0000-0002-1453-0374","documentHash":"61520225-d1dc-4fbb-99c7-30e50a32e15c"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a23cb","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Ptak","uuid":"5B32AB1951E9590FDB5F346D477E6DFAC944D8C25BDCEC33B775964F1D3C92B3AA8BA9FF98E504DC62B351D10C70832C3C9E3AA788EF2D47AE95E11AC3A895B0","orcidId":"0000-0003-1225-1686","documentHash":"228cfd7e-c9d9-45e5-aebc-e10c2f774eb2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"64afc4944097077ac5c0530e","doi":"10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101468","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2214581823001556?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A simple approach to estimate lake surface water temperatures in Polish lowland lakes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Study region\nLowland lakes located at Poland.\n\nStudy focus\nThere are thousands of lowland lakes in Poland, however, many of them don’t have observed data of water temperatures. How can we simply estimate lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is challenging, and a few studies tried to deal with this issue. In this study, we proposed a simple method using the air2water model for regional estimation of LSWT for Polish lowland lakes: Firstly, a literature review was conducted to collect parameter values of the air2water model applications in different lakes with diverse lake morphologies (e.g., mean depth). Secondly, correlations of model parameters with mean lake depth were analyzed. Finally, model parameters of the Polish lowland lakes (25 lakes with three lakes for testing) were derived using the corresponding mean lake depth and model performance was evaluated afterwards.\n\nNew hydrological insights for the region\nThe results showed that the proposed method performs generally well for the 25 Polish lowland lakes, better than the previous method. Reasonable results were obtained for three Polish lakes that were not used for regression analysis, what encourages application of the proposed approach on unmonitored lakes. The results indicated that the method proposed in this study can be used to estimate LSWT of Polish lowland lakes as daily data of air temperatures are readily available in most of the meteorological stations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

(EARLINET), part of the Aerosols, Clouds and Trace gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS), organized an intensive observational campaign in May 2020, with the objective of monitoring the atmospheric state over Europe during the COVID-19 lockdown and relaxation period. Besides the standard operational processing of the lidar data in EARLINET, for seven EARLINET sites having collocated sun-photometric observations in the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), a network exercise was held in order to derive profiles of the concentration and effective column size distributions of the aerosols in the atmosphere, by applying the GRASP/GARRLiC (from Generalized Aerosol Retrieval from Radiometer and Lidar Combined data – GARRLiC – part of the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties – GRASP) inversion algorithm. The objective of this network exercise was to explore the possibility of identifying the anthropogenic component and of monitoring its spatial and temporal characteristics in the COVID-19 lockdown and relaxation period. While the number of cases is far from being statistically significant so as to provide a conclusive description of the atmospheric aerosols over Europe during this period, this network exercise was fundamental to deriving a common methodology for applying GRASP/GARRLiC to a network of instruments with different characteristics. The limits of the approach are discussed, in particular the missing information close to the ground in the lidar measurements due to the instrument geometry and the sensitivity of the GRASP/GARRLiC retrieval to the settings used, especially for cases with low aerosol optical depth (AOD) like the ones we show here. We found that this sensitivity is well-characterized in the GRASP/GARRLiC products, since it is included in their retrieval uncertainties."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709359878c28a0473a7c28","62c796a8752340480571c972","5e70936c878c28a0473a93e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","name":"Wydział Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61c29bb87523404d4a91b186","5e709358878c28a0473a7b61","5e70935e878c28a0473a82ef"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"6025-6050","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659ff79940970707a130d763","659ff79940970707a130d764","659ff79940970707a130d765","659ff79940970707a130d766","659ff79940970707a130d767","62c796a8752340480571c972","5e70936c878c28a0473a93e2","5e709359878c28a0473a7c28","659ff79940970707a130d768","659ff79940970707a130d769","659ff79940970707a130d76a","659ff79940970707a130d76b","659ff79940970707a130d76c","659ff79940970707a130d76d","659ff79940970707a130d76e","659ff79940970707a130d76f","659ff79940970707a130d770","659ff79940970707a130d771","659ff79940970707a130d772","659ff79940970707a130d773","659ff79940970707a130d774","659ff79940970707a130d775","659ff79940970707a130d776","659ff79940970707a130d777","659ff79940970707a130d778","659ff79940970707a130d779","659ff79940970707a130d77a","659ff79940970707a130d77b","659ff79940970707a130d77c","659ff79940970707a130d77d","5e70935e878c28a0473a82ef","61c29bb87523404d4a91b186","5e709358878c28a0473a7b61","659ff79940970707a130d781","659ff79940970707a130d782","659ff79940970707a130d783","659ff79940970707a130d784","659ff79940970707a130d785","659ff79940970707a130d786","659ff79940970707a130d787","659ff79940970707a130d788","659ff79940970707a130d789","659ff79940970707a130d78a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724f","mniswId":"2028","title":"Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","issn":"1867-1381","eissn":"1867-8548","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"b1414007-a87e-47a0-b712-3f04757e74e8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659ff79940970707a130d762","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"24","documentHash":"8aed0992-925c-49b0-bab5-d92e6dc14083"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060739503"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6580079e4097073e4d1c3963","name":"Beata","lastName":"Latos","documentHash":"b3cee3ea-6a3f-47fa-9313-a5e4597cf703"},{"objectId":"6580079e4097073e4d1c3961","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Nykiel","documentHash":"bc43e3fc-808f-4889-b096-11241de62271"},{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b9529","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Baranowski","uuid":"E9C0F08149937783694881B65F0AA91602914BB2ED1CBB3776AF6AC11C6388CA908F908B25B7B953FD6562C52E891D68CE36AE7CAB983C00E90D44DDF9355D29","orcidId":"0000-0001-8848-3884","documentHash":"5097c8d3-cdae-4419-95fc-49ba6a4289a9"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b5271","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Bałdysz","uuid":"5B5A6156CC2BA5FE22FA50386AD6C55D90C65437ED4DB6AB795403D4530C2A6605F1588DAB053862DF01D51350D48873B136F04ECDFB9DD58C7AE2BBBD9E76A3","orcidId":"0000-0002-8398-6703","documentHash":"c0d3c8ec-378c-48c7-98ad-198037516ebb"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a0473996db","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Figurski","uuid":"3C410AB48F03D59EB6D5891065E7C86C6584E3783DA22223906BEA795C9A8D7F83F23C159F86D75D9AF57AA66BEFDA98C3A215CD693522E069165D350324F7AF","orcidId":"0000-0001-9602-5007","documentHash":"af467cd6-e12c-44b0-a594-ebfc5841969e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"6580079e4097073e4d1c395f","doi":"10.1007/s00382-023-07005-0","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00382-023-07005-0.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Diurnal variability of atmospheric water vapour, precipitation and cloud top temperature across the global tropics derived from satellite observations and GNSS technique","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The diurnal cycle of convection plays an important role in clouds and water vapour distribution across the global tropics. In this study, we utilize integrated moisture derived from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), satellite precipitation estimates from TRMM and merged infrared dataset to investigate links between variability in tropospheric moisture, clouds development and precipitation at a diurnal time scale. Over 16 years of observations were analysed to estimate the diurnal cycles for 42 sites that span across the global tropics and assess the GNSS precipitable water vapour suitability in tropical moisture variability studies. Results show that the GNSS technique can be successfully used for studies related to the high-resolution temporal variability of integrated atmospheric moisture and, thus, in the analysis of multi-scale interactions and clouds development. For most of the analysed cases, GNSS integrated humidity shows one daily maximum (regardless of the season), which is related to the afternoon precipitation and cloud top temperature daily minimum. Although diurnal integrated moisture variations typically do not exceed 2 mm (usually below 5% of the daily mean value), in favourable large-scale conditions such relatively small changes can lead to the development of convective clouds and can affect precipitation distribution. Thus, GNSS technology allows reliable monitoring of tropospheric moisture variability at a diurnal time scale, which can be leveraged for improved monitoring and prediction of high-impact weather."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6580079e4097073e4d1c3963","5e709445878c28a0473b9529"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","uid":"bFhiVYWupXf-L0BTdpdX5dg","uuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","name":"Instytut Meteorologii i Gospodarki Wodnej - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929f878c28a0473996db","5e709408878c28a0473b5271"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","parentUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","rootUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"62","pagesFromTo":"1965–1982","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709408878c28a0473b5271","6580079e4097073e4d1c3961","5e709445878c28a0473b9529","6580079e4097073e4d1c3963","5e70929f878c28a0473996db"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547767a","mniswId":"3760","title":"CLIMATE DYNAMICS","issn":"0930-7575","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"79c88379-6d62-463a-88a6-26ab7be11ff0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6628d0a34097073ca70f8b40","year":"2024","volume":"","number":"62","doi":"","documentHash":"6ccf5226-ba90-4342-9dbe-6fc8b1171089"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060750246"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6388c3a34097074ca3212e8a","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Burzyński","documentHash":"22d2dca4-6de3-4b93-b5a3-c48216f5eccf"},{"objectId":"6388c3a34097074ca3212e89","name":"Geoffrey M.","lastName":"Manby","documentHash":"d642565c-e999-45b4-8901-e1b369866a19"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59e0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Michalski","uuid":"5FF5D809568986D02ED21B7818CBB592D56ACA57F1BD69AD3CD8B98A862F53603F17E687ADDFC72B039505E1AEACD1C7F0DF215F709ACC13F1CC6908BC3BCB45","orcidId":"0000-0002-2568-4301","documentHash":"80cc8e25-cebb-4722-851b-b3e2b7f19a5b"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7d72","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Domańska-Siuda","uuid":"99E450062180D1EFF5D0781D8E53F55ABB1D7252756B0DBB1FA4027E250BBD4738C00BCBC19D8093A8C4FFAF380595618F01682241B7082143B307B51E439B22","orcidId":"0000-0002-9810-6211","documentHash":"8cfb99e1-0e3c-478d-935c-6822c0c79f0f"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a78d8","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nejbert","uuid":"6CCD8803217F94FF5BE9B067C83312F928076BBDBA01D243A9903C90CC73E4793D45A35B3281C6C51543373658430C8F9563043D2CC4BD7A79E0EE0AE1E6E1B6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0021-2172","documentHash":"e243861c-c110-477e-8b45-8eb392622462"}],"objectId":"6388c3a34097074ca3212e87","doi":"10.1144/jgs2021-167","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/jgs2021-167","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Palaeomagnetic investigations across Hinlopenstretet border zone: from Caledonian metamorphosed rocks of Ny Friesland to foreland facies of Nordaustlandet (NE Svalbard)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"New demagnetization results of 286 palaeomagnetic specimens from 15 sites in Neoproterozoic – Lower Palaeozoic sequences of Ny Friesland - Nordaustlandet (the Caledonian Eastern Svalbard Terrane) are presented. New in situ40Ar/39Ar Uv-MS age determinations on amphibolites and mylonites from the Ny Friesland cluster in the 340–460 Ma interval correspond broadly to the Caledonian thermal event. Older ages are observed but are more scattered and likely reflect partial resetting/argon gain of Proterozoic micas. Palaeomagnetic, petrological and structural data confirm a west to east decrease in the degree of the Caledonian metamorphism and remagnetization across Hinlopenstretet, which is interpreted here to coincide with the limit of Caledonian east-directed over-thrusting. No pre-Caledonian palaeomagnetic record was identified in investigated amphibolites and metacarbonates of Ny Friesland. Pre-folding pre-Caledonian, potentially Neoproterozoic (primary ?) magnetization was recognized only in non-metamorphosed Murchisonfjorden (Nordaustlandet) carbonates. However, selective palaeomagnetic palaeopoles from Murchisonfjorden also fall into Caledonian sensu lato and Mesozoic sectors of Laurussia reference path. This also indicates that regions east of Hinlopenstretet and east of the Caledonian front could be partially subjected to Caledonian remagnetization. Mesozoic palaeomagnetic overprints are potentially related to the injection of Mesozoic dolerites in Eastern Svalbard. Here, we discuss two concepts of post-Caledonian rotations that could affect the palaeomagnetic record of the Eastern Svalbard Terrane - rotations around vertical axes related to strike-slip faults and rotations around horizontal axes related to normal listric faults that originated during the extension in Devonian Basin and the opening of Atlantic and Arctic Oceans."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df17","uid":"bxvEdTB_rZDwTwDCxKD8MAA","uuid":"baafdd5c-15d8-49db-ac14-1067a5fabd1b","name":"Wydział Geologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709356878c28a0473a78d8","5e709359878c28a0473a7d72"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b59e0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"1","issue":"180","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709410878c28a0473b59e0","6388c3a34097074ca3212e89","5e709356878c28a0473a78d8","5e709359878c28a0473a7d72","6388c3a34097074ca3212e8a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478b30","mniswId":"12904","title":"Journal of the Geological Society","issn":"0016-7649","documentHash":"f7c96105-c216-4363-98e0-8cfd3ccd34ec"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659fff1f40970707a1316858","year":"2023","volume":"180","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"d669c78c-2890-49c3-8eb3-019ec0d421c7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060800222"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d7c19a4097074c742c0108","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wróbel","documentHash":"2eed9b09-5684-43f5-b51b-778635333a52"},{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c990","name":"Artur","lastName":"Marciniak","uuid":"5218C630BD00E1D15FDE8DD95D286784DA876E0E8000313F823180BBF748D7DC9F0A8023A1F90AFE9C5AD5782E365D07C763275DF0F9E05D63FA3DF6DD9BDA9E","documentHash":"64902d05-2f25-441a-b4b1-d9cdb1529f5c"},{"objectId":"5e70941b878c28a0473b64e7","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Cader","uuid":"7A38BACB7C777A9FADAF1B8A68B4970B5BA80DDBD4CCF0EBE9C16D0471F10548EAD4DB87DA7AD4FF6805807ADD408A3D47A34577732E4889FC06FDF221763A72","orcidId":"0000-0001-5236-3223","documentHash":"2eaf5dab-c065-43aa-a84e-077e7560eecc"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Majdański","uuid":"89D7E80830B607723CEFEDCFBDA5FC52ECA8EFD548784730711C4D8752516F3FD892A2BCEDA865B4737074B27716938ACD71EC45855B87BECB169C65C89CD172","orcidId":"0000-0002-8909-4407","documentHash":"0b6165bd-7e9b-4ab0-9954-9e96b9ceabf6"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7d90","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"36354621FD3ACABEE60EEF462A8EA98A21FDBDDFE2F41C0FA82706A86249123537A7CC0F53EE799E15B10290A6D93F9F3038B4C42D65A799F028B12302C313D1","orcidId":"0000-0002-9835-1479","documentHash":"2d1bde9c-ae82-4bd4-bc05-64dd88fbf446"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a23c8","name":"Adam","lastName":"Nawrot","uuid":"62E26EB8A7FD937B6F4EC478E5F86852F14D84281B3DDBE242AA1B58FF7741578B6ECC7A4C19192C210949FB912077FF7C3A914E35B207156C9A9722F02B6B1A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6619-6478","documentHash":"c0165202-67c7-4155-873c-b372458e73bc"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f402","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Stan-Kłeczek","uuid":"C379F73F845B4CA18EDB428D0D8BB33F9C0FAD008A657170887C5B1972687F8B88AE9383D48CBD027AF79973FD380859CB3EF8187B5D644AA90EFE10627494BC","orcidId":"0000-0003-0757-5926","documentHash":"54b9d6d2-534d-430a-bcfd-d9c9e80c9864"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63b27cae4097074fedfb8944","doi":"10.3390/rs15010238","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/1/238","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Integrated Geophysical Imaging and Remote Sensing for Enhancing Geological Interpretation of Landslides with Uncertainty Estimation —A Case Study from Cisiec, Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Landslides, as one of the main problems in mountainous areas, are a challenging issue for modern geophysics. The triggers that cause these phenomena are diverse (including geological, geomorphological, and hydrological conditions, climatic factors, and earthquakes) and can occur in conjunction with each other. Human activity is also relevant, undoubtedly contributing to the intensification of landslide phenomena. One of these is the production of artificial snow on ski slopes. This paper presents a multimethod approach for imaging the landslide structure in Cisiec, in southwestern Poland, where such a situation occurs. In the presented work, the integration of remote sensing with multi-method geophysical imaging was used to visualize landslide zones, and to estimate ground motion. To verify the uncertainty of the obtained data, the combination of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW), and seismic refraction method (SRT) was supported by synthetic modeling. Using geophysical data with accurate GPS-based topography and a terrestrial laser scanning-based digital terrain model (DTM), it was possible to model the spatial variability and surface area of the landslide more precisely, as well as to estimate the velocity field in the nearest surface more accurately. The final result shows displacement up to 1 m on the ground surface visible on the DTM models, while the geophysical methods confirm the change in internal structure. The proposed methodology is fast, cost-effective, and can be used to image the structure of landslides, where the shallowest parts are usually complex and thus difficult to observe seismically."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df17","uid":"bxvEdTB_rZDwTwDCxKD8MAA","uuid":"baafdd5c-15d8-49db-ac14-1067a5fabd1b","name":"Wydział Geologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709359878c28a0473a7d90"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c796a8752340480571c990","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","5e709310878c28a0473a23c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737e9d9","uid":"bnin_CfrOxQK6XxaYJytRhg","uuid":"3178cdc9-4bfd-44e5-a0dc-d37b30326a58","name":"Instytut Gospodarki Surowcami Mineralnymi i Energią Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70941b878c28a0473b64e7"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9d9","parentUuid":"3178cdc9-4bfd-44e5-a0dc-d37b30326a58","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9d9","rootUuid":"3178cdc9-4bfd-44e5-a0dc-d37b30326a58","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ec878c28a04739f402"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"238","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d7c19a4097074c742c0108","5e7092ec878c28a04739f402","62c796a8752340480571c990","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb14","5e709359878c28a0473a7d90","5e709310878c28a0473a23c8","5e70941b878c28a0473b64e7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","issn":"2072-4292","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"adfc571f-e92f-4da0-8504-22894916b3f6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bbfb6240970754861e9aaf","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"1a1f29b5-db6e-4727-a3a2-9824ee31fa5f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["landslide","electrical resistivity tomography (ERT)","seismic tomography","multichannel analysis of surface wave (MASW)","digital terrain model (DTM)","forward modeling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060814648"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60a763e69543c758682b6462","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Owoc","uuid":"C3BE9C17C052EEE31998B2C2863BFD09672CB888B5A43DFB2DE8B37A9145FE4964116AABE8FF30A37DEF50464557E03ACF88E7F815F10E5A032569328E561EE4","documentHash":"c77701a1-449a-4c83-b53b-54eb40160a65"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac905","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Oryński","uuid":"A17EA2EE114F671518354F32A8ED76AB1E3A7196F2763C307ADE9326E4BB84E23171FE6093FE73D734C78BDA024BC40ECAD077ADA22A39DF3F641AC6E3CDFCC1","orcidId":"0000-0001-5764-4876","documentHash":"61882f30-20a1-421c-8d64-9698828ead87"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7d90","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"36354621FD3ACABEE60EEF462A8EA98A21FDBDDFE2F41C0FA82706A86249123537A7CC0F53EE799E15B10290A6D93F9F3038B4C42D65A799F028B12302C313D1","orcidId":"0000-0002-9835-1479","documentHash":"2d1bde9c-ae82-4bd4-bc05-64dd88fbf446"}],"objectId":"646e0d7840970770404f0473","doi":"10.1515/geo-2022-0484","publicUri":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/geo-2022-0484/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Ground penetrating radar and magnetic gradient distribution approach for subsurface investigation of solution pipes in post-glacial settings","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Solution pipes are an important geomorphological feature in carbonate rocks formed by the host rock’s dissolution due to water’s focused flow, indicating the phenomena of water focusing in particular areas. However, their visual exposures are often limited by sediment and vegetation cover, making it challenging to understand their spatial distribution and morphology. In this study, we used geophysical methods such as ground penetrating radar (GPR) and magnetic gradiometer to detect and estimate the spatial distribution of solution pipes in a freshly exposed quarry site in Smerdyna, Poland. Our results indicate that both GPR and magnetometric measurements effectively detect most of the solution pipes, particularly those filled with large amounts of clay and silt particles. The GPR method, in particular, proved to be convenient due to the high contrast of the dielectric constant. The information on the positions and shapes of the pipes obtained based on these methods is crucial in understanding the link between pipe morphology and the physical conditions at the time of their formation. Furthermore, our measurements provided quasi-spatial correlations between pipe positions, the distribution of inter-pipe distances, and the potential relationship between alignments of rock joints and pipe locations. Our study demonstrates the potential of geophysical methods in detecting and understanding solution pipes, which are essential from environmental and climatic perspectives. This information can be used for future studies on pipe formation and environmental impact."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60a763e69543c758682b6462","5e70938d878c28a0473ac905"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df17","uid":"bxvEdTB_rZDwTwDCxKD8MAA","uuid":"baafdd5c-15d8-49db-ac14-1067a5fabd1b","name":"Wydział Geologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709359878c28a0473a7d90"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938d878c28a0473ac905","5e709359878c28a0473a7d90","60a763e69543c758682b6462"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790f3","mniswId":"15431","title":"Open Geosciences","issn":"2391-5447","eissn":"2391-5447","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"b50f3ecf-0af5-4890-9378-1b6786136fcf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6405a98e40970761b8dd3c44","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"1","documentHash":"e97764eb-fc3b-487c-ae57-02208a08d5fb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ground penetrating radar; magnetic gradiometer; solution pipes; epikarst"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060814686"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6809cb7dfdbe831c0f911204","name":"Marek","lastName":"Kasprzak","documentHash":"52e13761-7b1f-485a-ba33-86e3cc3653f2"},{"objectId":"6809cb7dfdbe831c0f911203","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Wołoszyn","documentHash":"9c4fc48e-a18f-4884-869a-a50c4fdd7d13"},{"objectId":"6809cb7dfdbe831c0f911202","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Marszałek","documentHash":"5897541f-32b2-418d-8778-8b442105196f"},{"objectId":"6809cb7dfdbe831c0f911201","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Wąsik","documentHash":"1ad024a0-096e-494c-8fb4-dfaa47283b3b"},{"objectId":"6809cb7dfdbe831c0f911200","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Migała","documentHash":"f433e4c8-6125-49cb-96d7-31c484ca89f6"},{"objectId":"6809cb7dfdbe831c0f9111ff","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Stachnik","documentHash":"4e8968ce-6815-4fc4-9817-3c4803320fe2"},{"objectId":"60de971e9543c72336544649","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Bartosiewicz","uuid":"6038882D53BF8705F7CC73DC0B96D4E94A813F14440B999810EE9A26FF707CA592D37BB5E44D8F3AA399B31C5B3C54C0151658B91A9647C5AD96000BECBE9DD8","documentHash":"1e8cf486-5b86-4b01-8673-5c324044e85f"},{"objectId":"5ec1f75e7523403547daef5b","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Pilguj","uuid":"8E828168D821197381EC802D6BA809428293217322CAF7DF852DDDB888B81ACACCFBC0A132B5AE65B8C67ED9CB01FD22FB22E273E2F0E7862AEFB927776F0658","documentHash":"2e5d17fd-f80b-4874-bf5b-9f9d5b588f88"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8d29","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Łepkowska","uuid":"1ECDE5E4CBCCF0D16350421D764C55422B17D42779406AA2A34D9B5598A1DBCA4A8ADF4EDEBB2AA665057F85961E90908EFC7C8A8B09006FA963FBA28AFB3658","orcidId":"0000-0001-7810-3112","documentHash":"989dda01-072f-4f48-8052-5a2fc826f2ef"},{"objectId":"5e7093a8878c28a0473ae842","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Ignatiuk","uuid":"9EA1B68BFBE264C6151BE2FF4B2F409E403C92A47AB8C32FA9B833DA78AE058BAE840A649C2DFEE6EB001C8322EDCD3D4F472711D504138B350A9B5BB1A0B4D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2947-474X","documentHash":"689c4a5a-35e3-46f5-8942-d663e5a89818"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3de7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Zielonka","uuid":"BFEF8AEDB006C7DCBB314C3FAD85839EC7DE7999DED0C5ACF104491E534D7E6D8C02FD7930409A423F2483B829848E48C8508AF7254350BA3CE7B4A991F818D6","documentHash":"e9ce2681-91ef-4bbf-981d-2babce0d47c2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2025},"objectId":"6809cb7dfdbe831c0f9111fd","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.125189","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S030147972501165X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Resolving the climate-controlled hydrological regime in a model permafrost catchment for future management strategies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Climate change influences worldwide freshwaters with the most prominent effects in the Arctic and Alpine regions.

Here, we characterized the hydrometeorological controls on the glacial-fluvio-lacustrine regime in a model Arctic catchment (SW Svalbard) to inform contingency plans for regions endangered by glacial-floods and permafrost landslides. We compiled a comprehensive hydro-meteorological dataset between 2005 and 2019 from a larger database (1972–2019) and applied bootstrapping, random forest, and multiple regressions, to elucidate the relationships between drivers (temperatures, sunshine duration, precipitation) and the intensity of freshwater flows. The hydrology exhibits strong seasonality with a pronounced peak between June and July controlled by precipitation (R = 0.56). From August to September, low-to-intermediate freshwater discharge is controlled by interactive effects of air temperatures and precipitation (R = 0.71). The interaction between hydrometeorology and catchment-scale discharge is stronger for August and September compared to June and July. The strongest warming trend between August and September (1979–2019) makes this period particularly relevant with regards to the long-term changes and environmental management in the permafrost-underlain catchments. Indeed, our northern hemisphere meta-analysis (n = 1975) revealed that majority of glacial floods (51 %) occurs at that time. We argue that permafrost management should include monitoring of surface temperature, precipitation and snow cover enabling establishment of stabilizing infrastructure in sensitive regions whenever threshold values are exceeded (i.e., Tmin >4 °C; P > 30 mm) and discharges increase."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","uid":"bFhiVYWupXf-L0BTdpdX5dg","uuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","name":"Instytut Meteorologii i Gospodarki Wodnej - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ec1f75e7523403547daef5b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","parentUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","rootUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","uid":"bqvFVl6-FYxc-KjUUrbTwDw","uuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","name":"Instytut Ochrony Przyrody Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3de7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","parentUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","rootUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60de971e9543c72336544649"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8d29","5e7093a8878c28a0473ae842"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"383","pagesFromTo":"125189","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6809cb7dfdbe831c0f9111ff","6809cb7dfdbe831c0f911200","6809cb7dfdbe831c0f911201","6809cb7dfdbe831c0f911202","6809cb7dfdbe831c0f911203","6809cb7dfdbe831c0f911204","5e70943f878c28a0473b8d29","5ec1f75e7523403547daef5b","5e7093a8878c28a0473ae842","5e709328878c28a0473a3de7","60de971e9543c72336544649"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547868b","mniswId":"10995","title":"JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","issn":"0301-4797","eissn":"1095-8630","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"d30aaa9a-bd45-431e-8f0d-5d63eb273cb4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6809cb7dfdbe831c0f9111fe","year":"2025","volume":"383","documentHash":"75b86439-0130-4d52-9fd7-7672281b3aad"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["permafrost"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060890307"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66ab6de5fdbe832e1e9f1d16","name":"Michał","lastName":"Posyniak","documentHash":"c5d6ada2-803c-4dce-893c-0e45f84d5675"},{"objectId":"5e70946a878c28a0473bc970","name":"Karol","lastName":"Szymankiewicz","uuid":"21488F6467E27FD7B446F469E125CBEB33D59D3D1557B730069A31E68F8459F94B0325A177C4FAE0F5C377AC1BCCF2813EA89DA3A2448A7DD7764A6766ECC05B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5691-0116","documentHash":"d72efa82-03ec-45aa-a830-877f8b0958ca"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c87","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Durka","uuid":"078E7E67CC7ED3C54A9800313159FCD748BBA3CB90D5DD7AEBA91C8F30EA27B135CA39C881BF01B4B5038D817A75231A1E771D7AB88A22ACD7195898E12D76C3","orcidId":"0000-0002-1979-0810","documentHash":"285dafc0-5a65-48e7-9f8e-7f648d0ed000"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Markuszewski","uuid":"0014105502B25E9A2BA9F3C5F0DDFB201E300286645007F34F9BF1734051EE556B442316548E3AD68FE389CF9B7EAB5AEE3A3D2175A5C349563039874A4736EB","orcidId":"0000-0003-1160-6318","documentHash":"8b99a50a-c43a-445c-9075-c50ccb381d72"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-07-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66ab6de5fdbe832e1e9f1d15","doi":"10.3390/rs16132447","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/13/2447/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Parameterization of Dust Emissions from Heaps and Excavations Based on Measurement Results and Mathematical Modelling","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Assessment of the concentrations of dust pollution resulting from both measurements at reference stations and those determined using mathematical modelling requires accurate identification of the sources of emission. Although the concentration of dust results from several complex transport processes, as well as chemical and microphysical transformations of aerosols, sources of emissions may have a significant impact on the local level of pollution. This pilot study aimed to use measurements of the concentrations of dust (with the specification of the PM10 and PM2.5 fractions) made over a heap/excavation and its surroundings using an airship equipped with equipment for testing the optical and microphysical properties of atmospheric aerosols, and a ground station located at the facility. On the basis of the measurements, the function of the source of emissions of dust was estimated. According to our study, the yearly emission of dust varies between 42,470 and 886,289 kg for PM10, and between 42,470 and 803,893 for PM2.5 (minimum and maximum values). A model of local air quality was also used, which allowed us to verify the parameterization of emissions of dust pollutants for the PM10 and PM2.5 fractions from heaps and excavations based on the modelling results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["66ab6de5fdbe832e1e9f1d16"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918f878c28a04737e654","uid":"bcsJzMlD16IRLv2gmePak8w","uuid":"3ebee00c-2f73-43d5-bcbd-13c2d4d74ba4","name":"Instytut Ochrony Środowiska - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c87","5e70946a878c28a0473bc970"],"parentId":"5e70918f878c28a04737e654","parentUuid":"3ebee00c-2f73-43d5-bcbd-13c2d4d74ba4","rootId":"5e70918f878c28a04737e654","rootUuid":"3ebee00c-2f73-43d5-bcbd-13c2d4d74ba4","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"2447","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70946a878c28a0473bc970","66ab6de5fdbe832e1e9f1d16","5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c87"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","issn":"2072-4292","eissn":"2072-4292","websiteLink":"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing","documentHash":"70fe2a0d-444c-49ea-9c4d-4dcd904ee147"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6694f047fdbe830e86423d0b","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"13","documentHash":"d08c6696-62dd-4215-8ff8-ac9d1ab0af2c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060922915"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68079365fdbe8341f926921f","name":"Senlin","lastName":"Zhu","documentHash":"c0fdb41a-7d13-4928-a5dc-fceda0014865"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Napiórkowski","uuid":"6AE9EEECF23A9027016CE0A5043569229D6A23680190D0C326173C1E6985FE82CE8B15504F7C20E43EC7B867AD3C2CF79197D909B3D518AC611E0C30D884583C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0273-4193","documentHash":"03e7ee2b-1337-4436-8dc2-d4e7730e5939"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Osuch","uuid":"A15CE4704BFC55F4D73C5551A1BF8F722C8079811C8D2926C74DE5E2098F109CCBA98FF443EA760E7212470B8FEC3F616067AD3C9D8E6C8BEC9D2B1C3908DE94","orcidId":"0000-0002-1887-3569","documentHash":"447f1351-672a-4b79-b06d-7741f68786bb"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8bdf","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Karamuz","uuid":"42510623665FE0F9C3E90EFFBE52337DCA2E7F6274643BDAB5CD13591E0EDB68962EF018F363C9A1A8E2C85E685741F5523AFC7B270A7EAEB97A679F3C4E5C7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-7226-7412","documentHash":"3bf44037-d31d-40de-9945-7be966f84232"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","name":"Adam","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"864E3E49A2309C1FB479470AD68682EA3FAB4349A58557B0478C54157BBB2B92E9A4D1252BEC5AB9362F29E198D2892DA7519ED222E344D6630D3217C0FDAF82","orcidId":"0000-0003-0923-7314","documentHash":"25196237-6284-406e-a277-91b7ddef9871"}],"objectId":"68079365fdbe8341f926921d","doi":"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133236","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0022169425005748?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"How the choice of model calibration procedure affects projections of lake surface water temperatures for future climatic conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Almost all hydrological models require calibration. The same model but with different parameters may lead to diverse simulations of the hydrological phenomena. Hence, the choice of a calibration method may affect the model performance. The present paper is the first study analyzing how the choice of air2water model calibration procedure may influence projections of surface water temperature in lowland lakes under future climatic conditions. To address this issue, projections from 14 atmospheric circulation models, data from 22 lowland Polish lakes located in a temperate climate zone, and 12 different optimization algorithms are employed. The studied lake areas range from 1.5 km2 to 115 km2, and their maximum depths range from 2.5 m to 70 m. Depending on which calibration algorithm is applied, the differences in mean monthly surface water temperatures projected for future climatic conditions may exceed 1.5 °C for a small deep lake. On the contrary, the differences observed for shallow and relatively large lakes, due to the optimization procedure used, were lower than 0.6 °C each month. The largest differences in projected lake water temperatures were observed for the winter and summer months, which are especially critical for aquatic biota. Among the optimization algorithms resulting in the largest differences were those that fit historical data well, as well as those that do not reproduce historical data appropriately. Therefore, strong performance for historical data does not guarantee reliable projections for future conditions. We have shown that projected lake water temperatures largely depend on the calibration method used for a particular model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

measurements in water vapor, precipitation, and seawater during EUREC4A","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In early 2020, an international team set out to investigate trade-wind cumulus clouds and their coupling to the large-scale circulation through the field campaign EUREC4A: ElUcidating the RolE of Clouds-Circulation Coupling in ClimAte. Focused on the western tropical Atlantic near Barbados, EUREC4A deployed a number of innovative observational strategies, including a large network of water isotopic measurements collectively known as EUREC4A-iso, to study the tropical shallow convective environment. The goal of the isotopic measurements was to elucidate processes that regulate the hydroclimate state – for example, by identifying moisture sources, quantifying mixing between atmospheric layers, characterizing the microphysics that influence the formation and persistence of clouds and precipitation, and providing an extra constraint in the evaluation of numerical simulations. During the field experiment, researchers deployed seven water vapor isotopic analyzers on two aircraft, on three ships, and at the Barbados Cloud Observatory (BCO). Precipitation was collected for isotopic analysis at the BCO and from aboard four ships. In addition, three ships collected seawater for isotopic analysis. All told, the in situ data span the period 5 January–22 February 2020 and cover the approximate area 6 to 16∘ N and 50 to 60∘ W, with water vapor isotope ratios measured from a few meters above sea level to the mid-free troposphere and seawater samples spanning the ocean surface to several kilometers depth.\n\nThis paper describes the full EUREC4A isotopic in situ data collection – providing extensive information about sampling strategies and data uncertainties – and also guides readers to complementary remotely sensed water vapor isotope ratios. All field data have been made publicly available even if they are affected by known biases, as is the case for high-altitude aircraft measurements, one of the two BCO ground-based water vapor time series, and select rain and seawater samples from the ships. Publication of these data reflects a desire to promote dialogue around improving water isotope measurement strategies for the future. The remaining, high-quality data create unprecedented opportunities to close water isotopic budgets and evaluate water fluxes and their influence on cloudiness in the trade-wind environment. The full list of dataset DOIs and notes on data quality flags are provided in Table 3 of Sect. 5 (“Data availability”)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709489878c28a0473bf377"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709445878c28a0473b9529"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"465-495","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63eb48524097075ca50ef7dc","63eb48524097075ca50ef7dd","63eb48524097075ca50ef7de","63eb48524097075ca50ef7df","63eb48524097075ca50ef7e0","63eb48524097075ca50ef7e1","63eb48524097075ca50ef7e2","5e709445878c28a0473b9529","63eb48524097075ca50ef7e4","63eb48524097075ca50ef7e5","63eb48524097075ca50ef7e6","63eb48524097075ca50ef7e7","63eb48524097075ca50ef7e8","63eb48524097075ca50ef7e9","63eb48524097075ca50ef7ea","63eb48524097075ca50ef7eb","63eb48524097075ca50ef7ec","63eb48524097075ca50ef7ed","5e709489878c28a0473bf377","63eb48524097075ca50ef7ee","63eb48524097075ca50ef7ef","63eb48524097075ca50ef7f0","63eb48524097075ca50ef7f1","63eb48524097075ca50ef7f2","63eb48524097075ca50ef7f3","63eb48524097075ca50ef7f4","63eb48524097075ca50ef7f5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779dc","mniswId":"5272","title":"Earth System Science Data","issn":"1866-3508","eissn":"1866-3516","documentHash":"201c2399-6075-49c3-a1ba-6c5b25dadeef"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63eb48524097075ca50ef7db","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"1","documentHash":"b5303ed3-92dd-42d0-bf28-4955b206a149"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060956255"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Napiórkowski","uuid":"6AE9EEECF23A9027016CE0A5043569229D6A23680190D0C326173C1E6985FE82CE8B15504F7C20E43EC7B867AD3C2CF79197D909B3D518AC611E0C30D884583C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0273-4193","documentHash":"03e7ee2b-1337-4436-8dc2-d4e7730e5939"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","name":"Adam","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"864E3E49A2309C1FB479470AD68682EA3FAB4349A58557B0478C54157BBB2B92E9A4D1252BEC5AB9362F29E198D2892DA7519ED222E344D6630D3217C0FDAF82","orcidId":"0000-0003-0923-7314","documentHash":"25196237-6284-406e-a277-91b7ddef9871"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7de3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Piotrowska","uuid":"FBAE40D7319650E11C0335FA5D6AA1095965B08F4AD4DF082E1E05FD0FF22BE67CD6CC9F2E9E395A94A0570C621B182E6FFA1D8EE667ED711144DDA75303A79C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0375-1227","documentHash":"560ab5f6-23ff-45e8-86e6-0122de212bcd"}],"objectId":"659fd9e140970707a12e17e3","doi":"10.1016/j.swevo.2023.101378","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210650223001517","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Choice of benchmark optimization problems does matter","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Various benchmark sets have already been proposed to facilitate comparison between metaheuristics, or Evolutionary Algorithms. During the competition, typically algorithms are allowed either to run until the allowed number of function calls is exhausted (and one compares the quality of solutions found), or until a required objective function value is obtained (one compares the speed in reaching the required solution). During the last 20 years several problem sets were defined using the first approach. In this study, we test 73 optimization algorithms proposed between the 1960′s and 2022 on nine competitions based on four sets of problems (CEC 2011, CEC 2014, CEC 2017, and CEC 2020) with different dimensionalities. We intend to test the original versions of 73 algorithms “as they are”, with control parameters proposed by the authors of the particular method. The recent benchmark set, CEC 2020, includes fewer problems and allows much more function calls than the former sets. As a result, one group of algorithms perform best on older, a different one on the more recent (CEC 2020) benchmark sets. Almost all algorithms that perform best on CEC 2020 set achieve moderate-to-poor performance on older sets, including real-world problems from CEC 2011. Algorithms that perform best on older sets are more flexible than those that perform best on CEC 2020 benchmark. The choice of the benchmark may have a crucial impact on the final ranking of algorithms. The lack of tuning may affect the results that were obtained in this study, hence it is highly recommended to repeat a similar large-scale comparison with control parameters of each algorithm tuned, best by different methods, separately for each benchmark set."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","5e70942c878c28a0473b7920"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"83","pagesFromTo":"101378","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","5e70935b878c28a0473a7de3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798a4","mniswId":"19189","title":"Swarm and Evolutionary Computation","issn":"2210-6502","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"6b97eb84-87b8-49a2-b4c4-0959b027c2fe"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659fd9e140970707a12e17e4","year":"2023","volume":"83","documentHash":"a8ee1634-ce0d-4370-97ad-dd233f0061eb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Evolutionary algorithmsSwarm intelligence Metaheuristics Benchmarking Differential evolution Particle swarm optimization"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060970181"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Napiórkowski","uuid":"6AE9EEECF23A9027016CE0A5043569229D6A23680190D0C326173C1E6985FE82CE8B15504F7C20E43EC7B867AD3C2CF79197D909B3D518AC611E0C30D884583C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0273-4193","documentHash":"03e7ee2b-1337-4436-8dc2-d4e7730e5939"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","name":"Adam","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"864E3E49A2309C1FB479470AD68682EA3FAB4349A58557B0478C54157BBB2B92E9A4D1252BEC5AB9362F29E198D2892DA7519ED222E344D6630D3217C0FDAF82","orcidId":"0000-0003-0923-7314","documentHash":"25196237-6284-406e-a277-91b7ddef9871"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7de3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Piotrowska","uuid":"FBAE40D7319650E11C0335FA5D6AA1095965B08F4AD4DF082E1E05FD0FF22BE67CD6CC9F2E9E395A94A0570C621B182E6FFA1D8EE667ED711144DDA75303A79C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0375-1227","documentHash":"560ab5f6-23ff-45e8-86e6-0122de212bcd"}],"objectId":"6442516740970761c87fa226","doi":"10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106008","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197623001926","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Particle Swarm Optimization or Differential Evolution—A comparison","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the mid 1990s two landmark metaheuristics have been proposed: Particle Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution. Their initial versions were very simple, but rapidly attracted wide attention. During the last quarter century hundreds of variants of both optimization algorithms have been proposed and applied in almost any field of science or engineering. However, no broader comparison of performance between both families of methods has been presented so far. In the present paper ten Particle Swarm Optimization and ten Differential Evolution variants, from historical ones from the 1990s up to the most recent ones from 2022, are compared on numerous single-objective numerical benchmarks and 22 real-world problems. On average Differential Evolution algorithms clearly outperform Particle Swarm Optimization ones. Such advantage of Differential Evolution over Particle Swarm Optimization is in contradiction with popularity: In the literature Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms are two–three times more frequently used than Differential Evolution ones. Problems for which Particle Swarm Optimization performs better than Differential Evolution do exist but are relatively few. Although this result may be an effect of the choice of specific variants, experimental settings or problems used for comparison, some re-consideration of algorithmic philosophy may be needed for Particle Swarm Optimization variants to make them more competitive."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","5e70942c878c28a0473b7920"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1e","uid":"b-yrvkc3sVahSubiYepE95Q","uuid":"179cf2df-1469-45a3-bc52-103b2f4e9ca5","name":"Wydział Polonistyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7de3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"121","pagesFromTo":"106008","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","5e70935b878c28a0473a7de3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477abd","mniswId":"5708","title":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","issn":"0952-1976","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"19ed2b1b-ccc4-460e-b276-71b61c0ab49b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6442516740970761c87fa227","year":"2023","volume":"121","documentHash":"624e7c8d-00db-44a7-b838-10a46d1bfc66"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Particle Swarm Optimization Differential Evolution Evolutionary algorithms Swarm intelligence Metaheuristics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060970805"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63170656409707488e9efd0b","name":"L.

We performed a magnetic and microscopic study on different eruptive sequences <14 ky in age and found that temperature and field dependence of magnetic susceptibility are suited to separate eruption phases. We observed homogeneous titanomagnetite with Curie temperatures (TC) of 50–200°C and 200–400°C, together with different amounts of oxy-exsolved titanomagnetite with TC ∼ 570°C. Some block-and-ash flow deposits show remarkably irreversible TC in heating and cooling branches with a positive ΔTC (TC heating–TC cooling) of up to 130°C in the center. The central part of this sequence is characterized by decreasing magnetic susceptibility and low field dependence of magnetic susceptibility (<10%), which is atypical for ulvöspinel-rich titanomagnetite. The nonreversibility of heating and cooling runs measured with rates of around 10 K/min is probably related to vacancy-enhanced nanoscale chemical clustering, which seems to occur preferentially during rapid quenching, possibly combined with subtle maghemitization. In contrast, pumice layers have the highest field dependence (∼20%) and contain Ti-rich and intermediate titanomagnetite with TC < 100 and ∼300°C, which are in line with mafic and more evolved magma composition. In intermediate phases, irreversibility of TC is more common but with a relatively low ΔTC of ±20°C.

The ozone decrease at the northernmost site, Ny-Ålesund (79°N) was about 43% with respect to a climatology of more than 30 years. The magnitude of the decrease declined by about 0.7% deg−1 moving south to reach nearly 15% at 40°N. In addition, it was found that the variations of the ozone column at each of the selected stations in March-May were similar to those observed at Ny-Ålesund but with a delay increasing to about 20 days at mid-latitudes with a gradient of approximately 0.5 days deg−1. The distributions of reconstructed ozone column anomalies over a sector covering a large European area show decreasing ozone that started from the north at the beginning of April 2020 and spread south. Such behavior was shown to be similar to that observed after the Arctic ozone depletion in 2011. Stratospheric dynamical patterns in March–May 2011 and during 2020 suggested that the migration of ozone-poor air masses from polar areas to the south after the vortex breakup caused the observed ozone responses. A brief survey of the ozone mass mixing ratios at three stratospheric levels showed the exceptional strength of the 2020 episode. Despite the stronger and longer-lasting Arctic ozone loss in 2020, the analysis in this work indicates a similar ozone response at latitudes below 50°N to both 2011 and 2020 phenomena."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b466a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"128","issue":"3","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6454bfbb409707605d5bd12d","6454bfbb409707605d5bd12e","6454bfbb409707605d5bd12f","6454bfbb409707605d5bd130","6454bfbb409707605d5bd131","6454bfbb409707605d5bd132","6454bfbb409707605d5bd133","6454bfbb409707605d5bd134","6454bfbb409707605d5bd135","6454bfbb409707605d5bd136","6454bfbb409707605d5bd137","6454bfbb409707605d5bd138","6454bfbb409707605d5bd139","6454bfbb409707605d5bd13a","6454bfbb409707605d5bd13b","6454bfbb409707605d5bd13c","6454bfbb409707605d5bd13d","6454bfbb409707605d5bd13e","6454bfbb409707605d5bd13f","6454bfbb409707605d5bd140","6454bfbb409707605d5bd141","6454bfbb409707605d5bd142","6454bfbb409707605d5bd143","6454bfbb409707605d5bd144","6454bfbb409707605d5bd145","6454bfbb409707605d5bd146","6454bfbb409707605d5bd147","5e7093fc878c28a0473b466a","6454bfbb409707605d5bd148","6454bfbb409707605d5bd149","6454bfbb409707605d5bd14a","6454bfbb409707605d5bd14b","6454bfbb409707605d5bd14c","6454bfbb409707605d5bd14d","6454bfbb409707605d5bd14e","6454bfbb409707605d5bd14f","6454bfbb409707605d5bd150","6454bfbb409707605d5bd151","6454bfbb409707605d5bd152"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c846","mniswId":"11226","title":"JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES","issn":"2169-897X","documentHash":"cd0abd39-d2c1-4d16-8e7a-ddc066b72490"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6454bfbb409707605d5bd12c","year":"2023","volume":"128","number":"3","documentHash":"f547efe8-7f43-43f0-862c-6dec9ac4a9fa"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654708369"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5883","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Dębski","uuid":"8D0C23F114740CD1AF16B23AA1226267604D047C0D65ECA893E31C6A87E42F6B776C66DB7327E21E2DBA4A218C46FB5D534123CF4C13BC6C26CDC34D585EC4A4","orcidId":"0000-0002-5339-0300","documentHash":"2c63d54b-c00f-4523-b657-3fcef721c537"}],"objectId":"63a05e9640970720499ac777","doi":"10.32045/pg-2022-030","publicUri":"https://ptgeof.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3_1-2.2022.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"SYMULACJE PĘKANIA MATERIAŁÓW O ZIARNISTEJ STRUKTURZE MIKROSKOPOWEJ – PIERWSZE UWAGI","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W świecie fizyki doskonale znany jest pewien paradoks, tj. im jakiś proces występuje\nczęściej, tym trudniejszy jest do opisania z punktu widzenia praw fizyki. Świetnym tego\nprzykładem jest zjawisko pękania i fragmentacji ciał stałych. Z jednej strony jest to proces\nniezwykle pożądany i praktycznie wykorzystywany; z drugiej strony, niekontrolowany,\nmoże prowadzić do przeróżnych katastrof. Tego typu zjawiskami w obszarze geofizyki\nsą trzęsienia ziemi oraz, nabierające coraz większego znaczenia w dobie zmiany klimatu,\nprocesy fragmentacji lodowców. Dotychczasowe próby jakościowego zrozumienia tych\nnaturalnych procesów nie dały w pełni zadowalających wyników (Christensen 2013).\nCiągle nie rozumiemy wielu aspektów fizycznych i w konsekwencji nie możemy ich\nprzewidywać z akceptowalną wiarygodnością (Gibowicz, Kijko 1994). Jednym z elementów niezwykle utrudniającym badanie procesów prowadzących do trzęsień ziemi i występujących w czasie ich trwania jest fakt, że lokalizacja wstrząsów jest nieznana przed\nwystąpieniem wstrząsu. Co więcej, obszary ognisk trzęsień ziemi są zwykle trudno dostępne – niezwykle rzadko możemy co najwyżej zaobserwować ich ślady na powierzchni\nziemi w postaci przesuniętych fragmentów uskoków geologicznych (Aki, Rochards 1985).\nTe same uwagi odnoszą się w dużym stopniu także do pękania lodowców.\nPróby badań laboratoryjnych procesów pękania skał pozwalają obejść to ograniczenie, gdyż w warunkach laboratoryjnych można kontrolować warunki zachodzących\nprocesów. Jednakże badania takie są ograniczone rozmiarami badanych obiektów. Przeskalowanie wyników obserwowanych w laboratorium dla próbek skalnych rozmiarów\ncentymetrów do rzeczywistych rozmiarów trzęsień ziemi rzędu setek kilometrów i dramatycznie innych warunków fizycznych (wysokie ciśnienia, temperatury, itp.) jest problematyczne. Pewne nadzieje na postęp w zakresie badania mechanizmów trzęsień ziemi\nbudzi sejsmiczność antropogeniczna (Gibowicz, Kijko 1994). Z jednej strony występuje ona w dość dobrze kontrolowanych warunkach działalności przemysłowej, a więc umożliwia stosowanie metodyki badań laboratoryjnych. Z drugiej strony procesy antropogeniczne, np. indukowane pracami górniczymi, zachodzą w skali już charakterystycznej\ndla procesów naturalnych, a więc nie wymagają przeskalowywania. Jednak nawet w tym\nwypadku możliwość wykonania potrzebnych pomiarów jest istotnie ograniczona (Gibowicz, Kijko 1994).\nNowe możliwości w zakresie badania procesów pękania dają współczesne metody\nfizyki obliczeniowej (Buehler 2008). Pozwalają one w pełni kontrolować warunki symulacji numerycznych i dokonywać wszelkich potrzebnych „pomiarów” na każdym etapie\nsymulacji, a równocześnie dzięki coraz łatwiejszemu dostępowi do superkomputerów\nprzeprowadzać badania dla odpowiednio dużych obiektów. Należy jednak wspomnieć,\nże podejście to, pomimo niezwykłej atrakcyjności i elastyczności, ma ograniczenia. Najpoważniejszym jest problem doboru (znalezienia) odpowiedniego modelu numerycznego,\njak najdokładniej odzwierciedlającego fizykę badanych procesów (Hidalgo i in. 2002).\nW tym zakresie metodyka ta jest całkowicie uzależniona od wyników dostarczanych\nprzez badania fizyki teoretycznej (Hansen i in. 2015; Dębski i in. 2021).\nW niniejszej pracy omówiono wstępne, wybrane wyniki otrzymane w ramach takiego\nwłaśnie podejścia. Punktem wyjścia była próba odpowiedzi na pytanie o warunki pękania materiału z wyraźnie uziarnioną strukturą wewnętrzną, jako przybliżonego modelu\nmateriałów skalnych takich jak np. granit. W tym celu zastosowano Metodę Elementów\nDyskretnych (DEM) (Cundall 1971), stworzoną oryginalnie do symulacji zachowania materiałów sypkich, granulatów, itp. Metoda ta w sposób naturalny uwzględnia ziarnistość\nmateriału reprezentując go jako zbiór powiązanych i oddziaływujących wzajemnie cząstek. DEM pozwala w efektywny sposób opisywać ewolucję czasową skomplikowanych\ni dynamicznych warunków brzegowych, takich jak np. tworzenie się i ewolucja czasowa\nswobodnej powierzchni. Inaczej mówiąc, umożliwia ona realistyczne symulacje pękania\nciał stałych. Pytanie szczegółowe, na którym koncentrujemy się w niniejszej pracy, dotyczy procesów transformacji pracy sił zewnętrznych przy rozciąganiu materiału w energię wewnętrzną materiału, ze szczególnym uwzględnieniem zmian energii kinetycznej\ncząstek tworzących badany materiał przed ostatecznym pęknięciem „próbki” poddanej\nrozciąganiu."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940d878c28a0473b5883"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"LXVII","issue":"1-2","pagesFromTo":"39-54","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940d878c28a0473b5883"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a36a","mniswId":"25757","title":"Przegląd Geofizyczny","issn":"0033-2135","eissn":"2544-1655","documentHash":"8710e4b3-8c6d-4b5b-a4a6-e155be9acb44"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a05e9640970720499ac778","year":"2022","volume":"67","number":"1-2","documentHash":"c733111e-e26e-48c6-8c82-c8164ceb5002"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["numerical simulations, Discrete Element Method, solid material fragmentation, granular media, tensional fracturing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654729833"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6385c79d40970769ab6a3b12","name":"D.","lastName":"Yang","documentHash":"208c1501-03d1-49ca-b5f0-a9e00f63df6d"},{"objectId":"6385c79d40970769ab6a3b11","name":"B.","lastName":"Wouters","documentHash":"6e37c957-f465-4be5-a40f-4ea12f035a93"},{"objectId":"6385c79d40970769ab6a3b10","name":"K.","lastName":"Wood","documentHash":"7a581f7e-47dc-4874-a1c6-7807bcf89624"},{"objectId":"6385c79d40970769ab6a3b0f","name":"G.","lastName":"Wolken","documentHash":"b540098e-5365-4c87-97bf-b466f86b018d"},{"objectId":"6385c79d40970769ab6a3b0e","name":"Øyvind","lastName":"Winton","documentHash":"7b47b641-f22e-4705-80bc-73009fe9ebab"},{"objectId":"6385c79d40970769ab6a3b0d","name":"A.","lastName":"Wehrlé","documentHash":"673b798d-2b7f-4ee6-a404-c056d437f0b7"},{"objectId":"6385c79d40970769ab6a3b0c","name":"Melinda","lastName":"Webster","documentHash":"2a57abcb-99e5-408d-b657-1a9b740967ff"},{"objectId":"6385c79d40970769ab6a3b0b","name":"Muyin","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"f5597570-dfe2-4fcc-91ca-638ab06489a8"},{"objectId":"6385c79d40970769ab6a3b0a","name":"John E.","lastName":"Walsh","documentHash":"658fb69c-94ea-4f85-a25b-3aa3ed747c4a"},{"objectId":"6385c79d40970769ab6a3b09","name":"Donald A.","lastName":"Walker","documentHash":"5dafa3c2-d253-415e-816c-5b3bd8972a51"},{"objectId":"6385c79d40970769ab6a3b08","name":"C.

affect the global electric circuit. These effects have been studied by analyzing disturbances of the potential gradient in ground-based measurements in fair weather regions. In this paper, we investigate deviations in the potential gradient diurnal curve, during solar proton events, and Forbush decreases, from the mean values obtained in fair weather conditions. In each situation, we select only events which are not accompanied or followed by the other. Using the superposed epoch analysis, in order to enhance the visualization of small effects, we study the potential gradient data recorded between January 2010 and December 2019 at two stations located at low and middle-latitudes, and at two different altitudes: the Complejo Astronómico El Leoncito (CASLEO), Argentina: 31.78°S, 2550 m a.s.l., and the Geophysical Observatory in Świder (SWIDER), Poland: 52.12°N, 100 m a.s.l., respectively. For intense solar proton events (>100 MeV) we found a statistically significant increase of the potential gradient after solar proton events recorded at CASLEO and no such deviation in the potential gradient recorded at SWIDER. For Forbush decrease events (greater than 4%), no significant deviation of the potential gradient after the start of the event was found in both stations, however for very intense Forbush decreases (>7%) we found an increase of the potential gradient recorded at CASLEO."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

the Tatra–Fatra Belt located in the Central Western Carpathians (Slovakia). We characterize the main Late Cretaceous–Cenozoic deformation events and the changing strain that formed the geological setting of the Chočské vrchy Mts. by applying the Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility coupled with the Anisotropy of Anhysteretic Remanent Magnetization and complemented by petromagnetic analyses. We analyse Lower Cretaceous marly limestones of the Mraznica Formation (Fm.), which is a part of the Krížna nappe, and the “post-thrusting” Eocene–Oligocene Huty Fm. Petromagnetic experiments reveal that paramagnetic minerals control the magnetic susceptibility, although a distinct contribution of ferromagnetics (magnetite, hematite and likely pyrrhotite) is also documented. The magnetic fabric in both the Mraznica and Huty fms. is generally sedimentary with minor tectonic imprint. The NNE–SSW orientation of the magnetic lineation in most of the Mraznica Fm. sites corresponds well with the local bedding strike as well as the calculated regional statistical fold axis for the Krížna nappe, but it deflects from the expected orientation considering the regional Cretaceous thrusting direction. Similarly oriented magnetic lineation is also documented in some Huty Fm. sites. Magnetic and structural results reveal the dip of the post-trusting Paleogene strata covering the Chočské vrchy Mts. horst block differs from both the dip of magnetic lineation and the dip of statistical fold axis from the Krížna nappe within this uplifted block, suggesting complex uplift-related deformations. We conclude that Krížna nappe folds together with AMS lineation, both formed during Late Cretaceous thrusting, have been later rotated by an angle of 20° as an effect of Neogene transpression, which also affected the magnetic fabric of the post-thrusting cover."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602e0dbc9543c7410626eb4b","5e709415878c28a0473b5f26"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709431878c28a0473b7f5a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"73","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"451-471","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602e0dbc9543c7410626eb4b","5e709431878c28a0473b7f5a","5e709415878c28a0473b5f26"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e08","mniswId":"7112","title":"GEOLOGICA CARPATHICA","issn":"1335-0552","documentHash":"54ca2397-4062-490d-8c4c-2ca7d29d238d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6393395f4097073c978a654d","year":"2022","volume":"73","number":"5","documentHash":"af5ed236-dbbd-4ae7-8d28-b871976be035"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654764773"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Napiórkowski","uuid":"6AE9EEECF23A9027016CE0A5043569229D6A23680190D0C326173C1E6985FE82CE8B15504F7C20E43EC7B867AD3C2CF79197D909B3D518AC611E0C30D884583C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0273-4193","documentHash":"03e7ee2b-1337-4436-8dc2-d4e7730e5939"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","name":"Adam","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"864E3E49A2309C1FB479470AD68682EA3FAB4349A58557B0478C54157BBB2B92E9A4D1252BEC5AB9362F29E198D2892DA7519ED222E344D6630D3217C0FDAF82","orcidId":"0000-0003-0923-7314","documentHash":"25196237-6284-406e-a277-91b7ddef9871"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7de3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Piotrowska","uuid":"FBAE40D7319650E11C0335FA5D6AA1095965B08F4AD4DF082E1E05FD0FF22BE67CD6CC9F2E9E395A94A0570C621B182E6FFA1D8EE667ED711144DDA75303A79C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0375-1227","documentHash":"560ab5f6-23ff-45e8-86e6-0122de212bcd"}],"objectId":"6453a13d4097075bae332e0e","doi":"10.1109/access.2023.3247954","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/10005208/10050027.pdf?arnumber=10050027","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"How Much Do Swarm Intelligence and Evolutionary Algorithms Improve Over a Classical Heuristic From 1960?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hundreds of variants of Swarm Intelligence or Evolutionary Algorithms are proposed each\nyear and numerous competitions and comparisons between algorithms may suggest rapid improvement in\nthe field. However, such comparisons are often done between a limited number of methods and are based on\naveraged ranks of algorithms. This way they measure whether one method is on average ranked better than the\nothers, without giving any information on how much improvement is in fact obtained. In this study we show\na general comparison between 69 algorithms, starting from methods proposed in the 1960’s up to variants\ndeveloped in the early 2020’s, on single-objective static numerical problems. Algorithms are compared on\nsearching for a minimum of 30 different 50-dimensional mathematical functions, and on 22 real-world\nproblems. We focus on the relative improvement achieved by various algorithms over a single-solution based\nmethod proposed in 1960 by Howard Rosenbrock. We find that the general improvement of Evolutionary\nAlgorithms over Rosenbrock’s algorithm is relatively limited. It is high for the artificial benchmarks, for\nwhich many Evolutionary Algorithms find solutions 10 times closer to the global optimum in terms of fitness\nthan Rosenbrock’s algorithm, but much lower for real-world problems. Improvement is also higher when\nperformance averaged over many runs is compared, but lower when the best results from multiple runs are\nanalyzed. In the last case, only the best Evolutionary Algorithms are able to find solutions of a ‘‘typical’’\nreal-world problem that are 2-3 times better in terms of fitness than those found by Rosenbrock’s algorithm.\nThe relative improvement of recently proposed algorithms is not much better than the improvement achieved\nby algorithms proposed over a decade ago."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","5e70942c878c28a0473b7920"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1e","uid":"b-yrvkc3sVahSubiYepE95Q","uuid":"179cf2df-1469-45a3-bc52-103b2f4e9ca5","name":"Wydział Polonistyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7de3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"19775-19793","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","5e70935b878c28a0473a7de3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f9e","mniswId":"7872","title":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/access","issn":"2169-3536","eissn":"2169-3536","documentHash":"6533f5bd-6e84-4edf-a504-f472f39bf089"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d3d5e24097071d34c3a432","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"11","documentHash":"22d0b1e3-82bf-487b-95b5-bfed977052ab"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, metaheuristics, performance, Rosenbrock’s algorithm"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654771432"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b20","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Mizerski","uuid":"701B5D7D7AA53237569495D5318BA2683F6DF807391F02B976FEF27D347B20C6E279FAE1B0847BD7F143C52FAEB1B8D66FFAF9137A85F82AF6B7352A818AD837","orcidId":"0000-0003-0106-675X","documentHash":"fc47a420-7054-45f8-8d61-5c0327b8bf67"}],"objectId":"646c72af409707691c4cd163","doi":"10.1103/physreve.107.055205","publicUri":"https://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevE.107.055205","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Helical correction to turbulent magnetic diffusivity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The effect of helicity in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence on the effective turbulent magnetic diffusion is considered here.

The AC-related investigation is based on Schumann resonance (SR) measurements from six stations on four continents. The DC-related investigation utilizes atmospheric electric field (potential gradient, PG) measurements from six recording stations in Europe and the USA. According to data from the GLD360 and WWLLN lightning detection networks, the peak lightning stroke rate, 83/s, was dominated by negative polarity lightning, but the distributions of positive and negative lightning discharges in latitude and longitude around the volcano differed. A global intensification of SR is apparent in connection with the enhanced lightning activity caused by the eruption. SR data-based results confirm that the lightning activity in the eruption dominated the naturally occurring global activity for a period of about 1 hr. The highly localized increase in lightning activity over HT-HH was a unique point source of SR excitation. PG measurements suggest that impulse-like charging of the DC GEC, by ∼15%, via negative cloud-to-ground lightning strokes took place twice during the eruption. A time constant of 7 or 8 min has been inferred for near-surface PG changes due to these enhancements. This could be the first direct measurement of the time constant of the GEC near the Earth's surface, as well as the first observation of the direct charging of the DC GEC by a unique atmospheric electrified source."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a92"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"128","issue":"8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["645390b24097075bae325306","645390b24097075bae325307","645390b24097075bae325308","645390b24097075bae325309","645390b24097075bae32530a","645390b24097075bae32530b","645390b24097075bae32530c","645390b24097075bae32530d","5e709410878c28a0473b5a92","645390b24097075bae32530e","645390b24097075bae32530f","645390b24097075bae325310","645390b24097075bae325311","645390b24097075bae325312"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c846","mniswId":"11226","title":"JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES","issn":"2169-897X","documentHash":"cd0abd39-d2c1-4d16-8e7a-ddc066b72490"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"645390b24097075bae325305","year":"2023","volume":"128","number":"8","documentHash":"b39fc8ef-d5a6-4945-820e-cfc4d5923849"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654772072"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a38","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Senatorski","uuid":"042F614BF0959A8A2A0B936D89B003FA6D2B32E1EC38C595DB9642A8C8CD02AFA1239A18AD318B3801DBF445BDBA5221F3041D00E3FBC61874F70D37BA4D3582","orcidId":"0000-0002-2941-6355","documentHash":"b6e2ecfc-dece-4cf5-8903-0ddb46c161de"}],"objectId":"658038654097073e4d20ba94","doi":"10.32045/pg-2023-042","publicUri":"https://ptgeof.pl/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sejsmicznosc-trzesienia-ziemi-i-lingwistyka.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"SEJSMICZNOŚĆ, TRZĘSIENIA ZIEMI I LINGWISTYKA","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Trzęsienie ziemi jest dla nas zjawiskiem przypadkowym.

magnetosphere is still an important field of research as they play an important role in several space weather aspects. We present a statistical survey of the average ion mass in the dayside magnetosphere made comparing plasma mass density with electron number density measurements and focusing on both spatial and geomagnetic activity dependence. Field line resonance frequency observations across the European quasi-Meridional Magnetometer Array, are used to infer the equatorial plasma mass density in the range of magnetic L-shells 1.6–6.2. The electron number density is derived from local electric field measurements made on Van Allen Probes using the Neural-network-based Upper-hybrid Resonance Determination algorithm. The analysis is conducted separately for the plasmasphere and the plasmatrough during favorable periods for which both the plasma parameters are observed simultaneously. We found that throughout the plasmasphere the average ion mass is ≃1 amu for a wide range of geomagnetic activity conditions, suggesting that the plasma mainly consist of hydrogen ions, without regard to the level of geomagnetic activity. Conversely, the plasmatrough is characterized by a variable composition, highlighting a heavy ion mass loading that increases with increasing levels of geomagnetic disturbance. During the most disturbed conditions, the average radial structure shows a broad maximum around 3–4 Earth radii, probably correlated with the accumulation of oxygen ions near the plasmapause. Those ions are mostly observed in the post-dawn and pre-dusk longitudinal sectors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940d878c28a0473b5880"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"127","issue":"10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63b563894097076e47978e4c","63b563894097076e47978e4d","63b563894097076e47978e4e","63b563894097076e47978e4f","63b563894097076e47978e50","5e70940d878c28a0473b5880","63b563894097076e47978e51","63b563894097076e47978e52"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c84c","mniswId":"11232","title":"JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS","issn":"2169-9380","eissn":"2169-9402","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"dee8b00f-29c5-440a-bb8f-46d300d6b613"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63b563894097076e47978e4b","year":"2022","volume":"127","number":"10","documentHash":"6ce184cd-dba1-4cbb-9a7e-e610ef2027de"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654782584"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7b6f","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Neska","uuid":"ABDD27AD5A1510F9E6CE6388C3D35A34AE86073120D4669252AA6324C1A6EFE7F4565E2E7A3528104E735E9FC09CC8C14A8A22617D5A1323636B18EAC25F62D1","documentHash":"3d77f3ee-c177-438f-bc72-631360733f2e"},{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7b58","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"3491BD6807BE3EC043268DF250C0A90CFD5F3B4087F42ABE9E180A3463281C7AACFC530BDE4DBF425776BFFC635EBAB5E27BFFCB5D460CD24A6C90C3087AFFFF","documentHash":"046aaae9-3bb6-4477-be19-0323db09bea8"},{"objectId":"5e7094ba878c28a0473c2a9e","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Czubak","uuid":"57DA703ECAED83AE468F90C6BF0E126E6453471763B599473855C7A7FC077A4B628EC6E43AC679721C2BA222D8A52E5082ED2E5C5903F6027F49F3D49A20C93D","documentHash":"8cdc327d-78c9-4dad-82c6-4a59f74ddfa6"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5880","name":"Jan","lastName":"Reda","uuid":"6BCDE584F86CC166B596D3BFF0215DB00162BF33F46A0B67C52E2EB5C521C29E988735A684342D8EEEBF468AADD5497D2BEFF4C9BAF27588EA7C6C38E88F6693","orcidId":"0000-0003-4580-6190","documentHash":"7732ad0d-4da5-427b-bce8-6a7edddf9d3d"}],"objectId":"659d9f0c40970776647aadfe","doi":"10.25171/instgeoph_pas_publs-2023-025","publicUri":"https://pub.igf.edu.pl/results-of-geomagnetic-observations-belsk-hel-hornsund-2022,4,en,pubs,4,0,3,450.html","type":"BOOK","typeName":"Książka","year":2023,"title":"Results of Geomagnetic Observations: Belsk, Hel, Hornsund, 2022","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This publication contains basic information on geomagnetic observations carried out in 2022 in\nthree Polish geophysical observatories: Belsk, Hel, and Hornsund.

In this article, we propose to modify the air2water model in such a way that different parameters would be associated with lake stratification of cold waters than with lake stratification of warm waters. The situation of a mix of both cold water and warm water is also considered. The model is tested on 22 lowland Polish lakes against two classical air2water variants. As the new air2water model variant is slightly more complicated than the basic versions, we focus on the importance of the choice of the calibration method. Each variant of the air2water model is calibrated with eight different optimization methods, which are also compared on various benchmark problems. We show that the proposed variant is superior to the classical air2water models on about 90% of tested lakes, but only if the calibration approach is properly selected, which confirms the importance of the links between the model and appropriate optimization procedures. The proposed air2water variant performs well on various lowland lakes, with exception of large but shallow ones, probably due to the weak stratification of the shallow lakes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","5e70942c878c28a0473b7920"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"553-569","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942c878c28a0473b7920","5e70944d878c28a0473ba087","640b41d84097073c0f4faccd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fbc","mniswId":"7906","title":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","issn":"1939-1404","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"42ccf88e-58bf-4f14-8bff-51e422e51493"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"640b41d84097073c0f4faccc","year":"2023","volume":"16","documentHash":"85d97838-7935-4554-a4ee-1e545ab3ab50"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654793656"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"640b02ff4097073c0f4afeb1","name":"Ulf","lastName":"Söderlund","documentHash":"2093adb9-124c-428d-b894-ceb025ff526c"},{"objectId":"640b02ff4097073c0f4afeb0","name":"Antony","lastName":"Mamuse","documentHash":"1783841d-4851-4397-8331-b33686e272bd"},{"objectId":"640b02ff4097073c0f4afeaf","name":"Michael","lastName":"Knoper","documentHash":"983b09db-178d-4340-a1df-3a1e5056cba4"},{"objectId":"640b02ff4097073c0f4afeae","name":"Sandra","lastName":"Kamo","documentHash":"49197df5-a35d-4af3-8acf-cd4615dfa556"},{"objectId":"640b02ff4097073c0f4afead","name":"Richard","lastName":"Hanson","documentHash":"ca778b7d-09ed-4130-ade6-4c73f6ed259f"},{"objectId":"640b02ff4097073c0f4afeac","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gumsley","documentHash":"cf546cdb-043b-49bb-9f3d-da7b40f377a1"},{"objectId":"640b02ff4097073c0f4afeab","name":"Richard","lastName":"Ernst","documentHash":"6cbea081-96be-4d11-9ff0-454b3bee5ff0"},{"objectId":"640b02ff4097073c0f4afeaa","name":"Michiel","lastName":"de Kock","documentHash":"f6c66c97-b3c4-4edf-acf4-ecfa58f02dfa"},{"objectId":"5e7094f9878c28a0473c8417","name":"Ashley","lastName":"Gumsley","uuid":"98475AFE2C98BBC2060D8E305E3BF0436FB6AFA0BAB59905301B05689F6822591786192ABC1F034A7264593EA02A60893B7087818BC8802D46189F90089B54A4","orcidId":"0000-0003-1395-3065","documentHash":"5085d534-6af4-412f-b966-b41f9aecf5ea"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Luks","uuid":"FC0F8C1A25CDF854727B23DAF6DD04D1AD9513696FBFA8C968355CC0EFB6A3BDEB4F2A5DDD1AE5371489624E4D31807972D8B5C54FCC96768719FBBC97225A9F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2287-385X","documentHash":"3f73f8a6-7975-4c35-be1a-579f2ca67494"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b00ab","name":"Marek","lastName":"Lewandowski","uuid":"B6C72F710F8383C629CC3ED37BEC45A314B76B2E5601689136FF42716EC74E2F0BA23F047445A962D30D481A67712EEFD192C161DF9CEC056FAE79F0712A5E74","orcidId":"0000-0003-1504-3735","documentHash":"f0280aa1-4067-42cd-8b49-05b550346b0e"}],"objectId":"640b02ff4097073c0f4afea7","doi":"10.1144/sp537-2022-206","publicUri":"https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/pdf/10.1144/SP537-2022-206","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The Mutare-Fingeren Dyke Swarm: the enigma of the Kalahari Craton's exit from supercontinent Rodinia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Rodinia supercontinent broke apart during the Neoproterozoic. Rodinia breakup is associated with widespread intraplate magmatism on many cratons, including the ca. 720-719 Ma Franklin large igneous province (LIP) of Laurentia. Coeval magmatism has also been identified recently in Siberia and South China. This extensive magmatism terminates ⁓1 Myr before the onset of the Sturtian Snowball Earth. However, LIP-scale magmatism and global glaciation are likely related. U-Pb ID-TIMS baddeleyite dating herein identifies remnants of a new ca. 724-712 Ma LIP on the eastern Kalahari Craton in southern Africa and East Antarctica: the combined Mutare-Fingeren Dyke Swarm. This dyke swarm occurs in north-eastern Zimbabwe (Mutare Dyke Swarm) and western Dronning Maud Land (Fingeren Dyke Swarm). It has EMORB-like geochemistry, suggesting an asthenosphere mantle source for the LIP. The Mutare-Fingeren LIP likely formed during rifting. This rifting would have occurred almost ⁓100 Myrs earlier than previous estimates in eastern Kalahari. The placement of Kalahari against south-eastern Laurentia in Rodinia is also questioned. Proposed alternatives, invoking linking terranes between Kalahari and south-western Laurentia or close to north-western Laurentia, as alternative scenarios, also present challenges with no discernible resolution. Nevertheless, LIP-scale magmatism being responsible for the Sturtian Snowball Earth significantly increases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b00ab","5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f9878c28a0473c8417"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"537","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"359-380","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094f9878c28a0473c8417","640b02ff4097073c0f4afeaa","640b02ff4097073c0f4afeab","640b02ff4097073c0f4afeac","640b02ff4097073c0f4afead","640b02ff4097073c0f4afeae","640b02ff4097073c0f4afeaf","5e7093bd878c28a0473b00ab","5e7093fc878c28a0473b465f","640b02ff4097073c0f4afeb0","640b02ff4097073c0f4afeb1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dd03","mniswId":"22599","title":"Geological Society Special Publication","issn":"","eissn":"2041-4927","websiteLink":"https://sp.lyellcollection.org/","metadataSource":"USER","documentHash":"027d06b9-9982-4af3-83fd-e486c1cd645d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654793983"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64d4a484409707756bdc860b","name":"Axel","lastName":"Brandenburg","documentHash":"68ca8071-84a8-48e4-a47e-4a3e2065b262"},{"objectId":"64d4a484409707756bdc860a","name":"Nobumitsu","lastName":"Yokoi","documentHash":"a3873cc5-546f-482b-8df4-88610eb37f1d"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b20","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Mizerski","uuid":"701B5D7D7AA53237569495D5318BA2683F6DF807391F02B976FEF27D347B20C6E279FAE1B0847BD7F143C52FAEB1B8D66FFAF9137A85F82AF6B7352A818AD837","orcidId":"0000-0003-0106-675X","documentHash":"fc47a420-7054-45f8-8d61-5c0327b8bf67"}],"objectId":"64d4a484409707756bdc8608","doi":"10.1017/s0022377823000545","publicUri":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0022377823000545","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Cross-helicity effect on α-type dynamo in non-equilibrium turbulence","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Turbulence is typically not in equilibrium, i.e. mean quantities such as the mean energy and helicity are typically time-dependent. The effect of non-stationarity on the turbulent hydromagnetic dynamo process is studied here with the use of the two-scale direct-interaction approximation, which allows one to explicitly relate the mean turbulent Reynolds and Maxwell stresses and the mean electromotive force to the spectral characteristics of turbulence, such as the mean energy, as well as kinetic and cross-helicity. It is demonstrated that the non-equilibrium effects can enhance the dynamo process when the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is both helical and cross-helical. This effect is based on the turbulent infinitesimal-impulse cross-response functions, which do not affect turbulent flows in equilibrium. The evolution and sources of the cross-helicity in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence are also discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

Aerosol, Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS) officially became the 33rd European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) on 25 April 2023 with the support of 17 founding member and observer countries. As a pan-European legal organization, ACTRIS ERIC will coordinate the provision of data and data products on short-lived atmospheric constituents and clouds relevant to climate and air pollution over the next 15–20 years. ACTRIS was designed more than a decade ago, and its development was funded at national and European levels. It was included in the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) roadmap in 2016 and, subsequently, in the national infrastructure roadmaps of European countries. It became a landmark of the ESFRI roadmap in 2021. The purpose of this paper is to describe the mission of ACTRIS, its added value to the community of atmospheric scientists, providing services to academia as well as the public and private sectors, and to summarize its main achievements. The present publication serves as a reference document for ACTRIS, its users, and the scientific community as a whole. It provides the reader with relevant information and an overview on ACTRIS governance and services, as well as a summary of the main scientific achievements of the last 20 years. The paper concludes with an outlook on the upcoming challenges for ACTRIS and the strategy for its future evolution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

magnetism: Rock and mineral magnetic properties of the Chicxulub impact crater","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Chicxulub impact event at ca. 66 Ma left in its wake the only complex crater on Earth with a preserved peak ring, characterized by a well-developed magnetic anomaly low. To date, little is known about its magnetic properties. The joint Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) and International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) Expedition 364 drill core M0077A revealed that the peak ring consists of uplifted and strongly deformed granitoid basement rocks overlain by a 130-m-thick impact melt and suevite layer. Pre- and postimpact hydrothermal systems affected this basement with maximum temperatures up to 450 °C. We used microscopy, mineral chemistry, temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, and hysteresis properties to characterize the magnetic mineralogy of pre-, syn-, and postimpact rocks. Compared to its amount of pure, stoichiometric shocked magnetite, the granitoid basement shows low magnetic susceptibility, which is in line with earlier experimental studies indicating that shock reduces magnetic susceptibility. Cation-substituted magnetite with varying compositions in the melt rocks carries a higher induced and remanent magnetization compared to the basement. In the granitoid basement, magnetite was partially oxidized to hematite by a pre-impact hydrothermal event, but at lithological contacts with high-temperature impact melt rock, this hematite was locally retransformed back to magnetite. Elsewhere in the granitoid basement, the temperature reached in the hydrothermal system was too low for hematite retransformation. It was also too low to anneal all the lattice defects in the shocked magnetite, which likely occurs above 540 °C. The presence of shocked magnetite in the granitoid basement well explains the magnetic anomaly low due to its unusually low induced magnetization."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3d37"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"136","issue":"1-2","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659fcc8f40970707a12c0172","659fcc8f40970707a12c0173","659fcc8f40970707a12c0174","659fcc8f40970707a12c0175","659fcc8f40970707a12c0176","5e709328878c28a0473a3d37","659fcc8f40970707a12c0177","659fcc8f40970707a12c0178"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebffac7ad49b31ccec856d8","title":"GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN","issn":"0016-7606","eissn":"0016-7606","documentHash":"654af60d-d189-4a20-8d0f-19ef2d36d4c9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659fcc8f40970707a12c0171","year":"2024","volume":"1-2","number":"136","documentHash":"9b4497ba-b8e7-4720-b485-1d404e342427"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654926217"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65f17a2f40970767dc8cd866","name":"Ludovic","lastName":"Métivier","documentHash":"fad7ac69-5764-452c-8dfa-c7a892f6146f"},{"objectId":"65f17a2f40970767dc8cd865","name":"Romain","lastName":"Brossier","documentHash":"d2de2c3c-b594-424b-8d76-1cd35d588453"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a0473989c9","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Górszczyk","uuid":"0A6AE9F1EC9A1C443C1601B910B3422E361203C041A5225F1AAF35894B9C2763A7BC803BACC3400B7D1931FDD885C2A176CCC58E5930BA848AE9C0703A7D0641","orcidId":"0000-0002-9767-2772","documentHash":"c13106bc-e029-46e2-a892-271c4a59eaa7"}],"objectId":"65f17a2f40970767dc8cd862","doi":"10.1029/2023jb028172","publicUri":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2023JB028172","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"On the Effect of 3D Wave Propagation on 2D Regional‐Scale Velocity Model Building","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709297878c28a0473989c9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"129","issue":"3","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709297878c28a0473989c9","65f17a2f40970767dc8cd865","65f17a2f40970767dc8cd866"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c84b","mniswId":"11231","title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","issn":"2169-9313","eissn":"2169-9356","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"ad1e8de5-d0fd-498b-bad2-c1a063e71070"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65f17a2f40970767dc8cd863","year":"2024","volume":"129","number":"3","documentHash":"2248f6aa-0204-49a8-ad03-22e8331d8bf3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654933966"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65cf21654097075ea83f86e3","name":"A.","lastName":"Dunant","documentHash":"f5cf0895-a470-4d8a-b5fa-4d14ba6500c9"},{"objectId":"65cf21654097075ea83f86e2","name":"K.

Living with landslides is a daily reality for an increasing number of people, so establishing the nature of landslide hazard and risk is essential. Here we develop a model of landslide susceptibility for Nepal and use this to generate a nationwide geographical profile of exposure to rainfall-triggered landslides. We model landslide susceptibility using a fuzzy overlay approach based on freely-available topographic data, trained on an inventory of mapped landslides, and combine this with high resolution population and building data to describe the spatial distribution of exposure to landslides. We find that whilst landslide susceptibility is highest in the High Himalaya, exposure is highest within the Middle Hills, but this is highly spatially variable and skewed to on average relatively low values. Around 4 × 106 Nepalis (∼15% of the population) live in areas considered to be at moderate or higher degree of exposure to landsliding (>0.25 of the maximum), and critically this number is highly sensitive to even small variations in landslide susceptibility. Our results show a complex relationship between landslides and buildings, that implies wider complexity in the association between physical exposure to landslides and poverty. This analysis for the first time brings into focus the geography of the landslide exposure and risk case load in Nepal, and demonstrates limitations of assessing future risk based on limited records of previous events."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61bd55b87523404d4a8fb735"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"2","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65cf21654097075ea83f86da","65cf21654097075ea83f86db","61bd55b87523404d4a8fb735","65cf21654097075ea83f86dc","65cf21654097075ea83f86dd","65cf21654097075ea83f86de","65cf21654097075ea83f86df","65cf21654097075ea83f86e0","65cf21654097075ea83f86e1","65cf21654097075ea83f86e2","65cf21654097075ea83f86e3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779e1","mniswId":"5278","title":"Earth's Future","issn":"2328-4277","documentHash":"79e9c9b9-a3f3-4296-a288-ac6ce0f88db8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65cf21654097075ea83f86d9","year":"2024","volume":"12","number":"2","documentHash":"fbcbfa41-cfc9-472b-ae50-07a5880b86e5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654940044"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62e88c28752340480578b59e","name":"Vineet","lastName":"Jain","uuid":"CDA7BB58B2833B449535AD9DCCC7B2B9A9C4D6305D5CC8FCC60CCD411F50B66897DC3161AB96EBA877F87C6EA3AFE619BDCF079965986A3C76060B53D865412C","documentHash":"68f8c465-19e5-43aa-ba4d-81dbdd380398"},{"objectId":"625635a87523402df0a0ac64","name":"Meri","lastName":"Korhonen","uuid":"CD635A0428BB15A2C40C55EAB17203EDDAED2C12DA78557E4A53AB2EB5B3891856B4EEA307C6D0EF9D9013A8EFEB032C4ECD8A2986F2A6821560F6105C31AD16","documentHash":"b0640b20-d5c1-4748-a559-9c28dccb9599"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af532","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Moskalik","uuid":"7089D643B2594CC57D59DE2700FC187DBB9C4D62E0328B409B12232373FF164ED96D4B648D07CC92EF366549051735987A73E346A7B7CAB38ED8A2FACEA2C173","orcidId":"0000-0002-0615-9528","documentHash":"312a8722-20f8-4f71-88a9-6b2d058d4efe"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399421","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Głowacki","uuid":"2B61E3B0977F44ADF5940784DA33545E985A4674A2BE5C1A00602A9709904D6473265D9598959D628CA1FF81ACCF6380FF9FA95FBF4F462A70D671446FDC50E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-5164-0206","documentHash":"fda11004-7277-4981-810d-055b8dabc3a0"}],"objectId":"67501059fdbe8342911964f6","doi":"10.1029/2024jc021273","publicUri":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2024JC021273","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Hydrography of the Inner Basins in Hornsund (Svalbard): Heat Advection Near Tidewater Glaciers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Atlantic-type hydrography is becoming more dominant in the Svalbard fjords. Advected warm waters affect sea-ice formation and melting rates of tidewater glaciers. Therefore, it is important to study hydrographic variability in fjords. Here, we use hydrographic data from Hornsund fjord to investigate the presence of warm water masses close to tidewater glaciers. Data span from May to October of 2015–2023 and cover several inner basins: Brepollen, Samarinvågen, Burgerbukta West, and Burgerbukta East, in addition to the main fjord. Average temperatures above 2\nC are observed during August–October in the surface–50 m layer of all the inner basins, and during September–October in the 50 m–bottom layer of all the inner basins except Burgerbukta East. The surface–50 m layer of both Burgerbukta basins is colder and fresher compared to Brepollen, despite Burgerbukta basins being closer to the fjord mouth. These spatial differences likely arise from counter-clockwise currents that advect warm and saline shelf waters to Brepollen along the southern side of the fjord, and relatively cold and fresh mixed shelf-fjord waters to Burgerbukta as they exit along the northern side of the fjord. Burgerbukta East is the coldest and freshest inner basin. The differences between the two Burgerbukta basins suggest a strong influence of underwater sills and site-specific environmental processes such as glacier ablation and local circulation on the water properties. Observed differences in the water temperatures of these closely-spaced inner basins match the spatial variability in the glacier retreat rates, and indicate the importance of ocean forcing for the ice mass loss."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a047399421","625635a87523402df0a0ac64","62e88c28752340480578b59e","5e7093b2878c28a0473af532"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"129","issue":"11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62e88c28752340480578b59e","625635a87523402df0a0ac64","5e70929e878c28a047399421","5e7093b2878c28a0473af532"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c849","mniswId":"11229","title":"JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS","issn":"2169-9275","eissn":"2169-9291","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"59b92342-e5c4-40f2-9c0e-da48d6ebce72"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67501059fdbe8342911964f7","year":"2024","volume":"129","number":"11","documentHash":"6b16f2e6-4898-47c9-8f15-50fed2e2f7e8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654940415"},{"authors":[],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"6752c7aefdbe83525b90bb84","doi":"10.25171/instgeoph_pas_publs-2024-001","publicUri":"https://pub.igf.edu.pl/aleksander-guterch-in-memoriam-history-of-deep-seismic-soundings-in-poland,4,en,pubs,4,0,8,453.html","type":"EDITED_BOOK","typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","year":2024,"title":"ALEKSANDER GUTERCH IN MEMORIAM History of Deep Seismic Soundings in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This volume is an expression of respect for the outstanding Man of Science, Professor Aleksander Guterch, our long-time boss and colleague.

We also pointed out his significant, innovative contribution to this type of research conducted on a large scale in international cooperation in Europe and the polar regions. In addition to Aleksander’s professional accomplishments, briefly outlined by his collaborators and scholars from the Polish and international scientific community, we paid a lot of attention to his non-professional life, strong ties with his homeland, and memories of his closest relatives and friends. Worth recalling was also his deep interest in history, specifically the history of Polish arms, and his avid passion for collecting military memorabilia.

In this study, we show the structure and evolution of this controversially debated area, both on crustal and basin scale, by using three seismic reflection profiles combined with 2-D potential field data. The results demonstrate that the southern Baltic Sea is underlain by a thick crust of the East European Craton with a Moho depth in the range of 38–42 km. The overall crustal architecture is shaped by three phases of localized stretching in the early Paleozoic, Devonian-Carboniferous, and Permian-Mesozoic. The most spectacular feature of the southern Baltic Sea is a zone of thick-skinned compressional deformation produced by Late Cretaceous-early Paleogene inversion, including a system of thrusts and back thrusts penetrating the entire crust in an 80–90 km wide inversion zone. ENE-vergent thrusts are traced from the top of the Cretaceous down to the Moho and they are accompanied by back thrusts of opposite vergence, also reaching the Moho. Inversion tectonics resulted in the uplift of a block of cratonic crust as a pop-up structure, bounded by thrusts and back thrusts, and the displacement of the Moho within the STZ and TTZ. The similar mechanism of intra-cratonic inversion was recognized for the Donbas Foldbelt in eastern Ukraine, and it may be characteristic of rigid cratons, where deformation is localized in a few preexisting zones of weakness."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej

of Forbush Decreases on the Global Electric Circuit","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The suppression of high-energy cosmic rays, known as Forbush decreases (FDs), represents a promising factor in influencing the global electric circuit (GEC) system. Researchers have delved into these effects by examining variations, often disruptive, of the potential gradient (PG) in ground-based measurements taken in fair weather regions. In this paper, we aim to investigate deviations observed in the diurnal curve of the PG, as compared to the mean values derived from fair weather conditions, during both mild and strong Forbush decreases. Unlike the traditional classification of FDs, which are based on ground level neutron monitor data, we classify FDs using measurements of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) on the International Space Station. To conduct our analysis, we employ the superposed epoch method, focusing on PGs collected between January 2010 and December 2019 at a specific station situated at a low latitude and high altitude: the Complejo Astronómico El Leoncito (CASLEO) in Argentina (31.78°S, 2,550 m above sea level). Our findings reveal that for events associated with FDs having flux amplitude (A) decrease ≤10%, no significant change in the PG is observed. However, for FDs with A > 10%, a clear increase in the PG is seen. For these A > 10% events, we also find a good correlation between the variation of Dst and Kp indices and the variation of PG."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["66b6d0a8ece3986804420aec"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"4","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66b6d0a8ece3986804420aec","67850333fdbe833b3181d70a","67850333fdbe833b3181d70b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454797ed","mniswId":"18815","title":"SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS","issn":"1542-7390","eissn":"1542-7390","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"6bd3fc14-e6c4-4cb3-a4cd-4f4e6aecc8eb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67850333fdbe833b3181d709","year":"2024","volume":"22","number":"4","documentHash":"9d221e4a-0f3a-4d6d-8631-85596cdd090a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655038311"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b00ab","name":"Marek","lastName":"Lewandowski","uuid":"B6C72F710F8383C629CC3ED37BEC45A314B76B2E5601689136FF42716EC74E2F0BA23F047445A962D30D481A67712EEFD192C161DF9CEC056FAE79F0712A5E74","orcidId":"0000-0003-1504-3735","documentHash":"f0280aa1-4067-42cd-8b49-05b550346b0e"}],"objectId":"679b4576fdbe8318b4c9dc39","doi":"10.24425/academiapan.2024.152329","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/133255/50-54_Lewandowski_PL.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Historia zlodowaceń globalnych","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b00ab"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"3","issue":"79","pagesFromTo":"50-54","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b00ab"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e70fd3146e0fb0001b4f1f0","title":"ACADEMIA: MAGAZYN POLSKIEJ AKADEMII NAUK","issn":"1733-8662","documentHash":"8abe20cb-a7fe-4274-aa4c-96ffeb9e925b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679b4576fdbe8318b4c9dc3a","year":"2024","volume":"79","number":"3","documentHash":"f17a3a1b-9813-4d11-87c3-2a31aa90e462"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655040785"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"604735739543c711bc6eaa05","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Gajek","uuid":"5FBBBFF225D4EBBEF9CBB3DE3C03C4FC6893D1E35B3105D9B191BFFDEFADEED90B6936EA69DBA80ED7E130EDFC86929014B44A5EF912D95D9CE58C9FB8AB0342","orcidId":"0000-0002-8754-3440","documentHash":"62f65587-49a5-4193-b54e-931eceb96770"},{"objectId":"5ebee1a7752340254fc4391a","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Olszewski","uuid":"43368E83961FBEE221226C4A2B4C26B3F7823A73AE42114910D142B30495A93F731760C40B84AAB2A4FDE924C2459E03E6E518A52C0E3C083751A9CC0FDE1E29","documentHash":"ef88f41d-8d2a-4f59-85ff-2cee0f21646f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"677fe3fbfdbe831a91d8b1ec","doi":"10.32045/pg-2024-051","publicUri":"https://ptgeof.pl/?page_id=2760","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"AUTOMATYCZNA DETEKCJA I LOKALIZACJA WSTRZĄSÓW MIKROSEJSMICZNYCH NA LODOWCU HANSA NA SPITSBERGENIE","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Automatic detection and location of microseismic events on Hans Glacier on Spitsbergen"}],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["604735739543c711bc6eaa05"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2d","uid":"bC-42HEo3GjCw621B3jcCSw","uuid":"919617f6-b49f-4075-b60b-465136e8dcb3","name":"Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza im.

Standard Tikhonov regularization, though commonly used in FWI, applies uniform smoothing that often leads to oversmoothing of key geological features, as it fails to account for the underlying structural complexity of the subsurface. To overcome this limitation, we propose an FWI algorithm enhanced by a novel Tikhonov regularization technique involving a parametric regularizer, which is automatically optimized to apply directional space-variant smoothing. Specifically, the parameters defining the regularizer (orientation and anisotropy) are treated as additional unknowns in the objective function, allowing the algorithm to estimate them simultaneously with the model. We introduce an efficient numerical implementation for FWI with the proposed space-variant regularization. Numerical tests on sparse data demonstrate the proposed method’s effectiveness and robustness in reconstructing models with complex structures, significantly improving the inversion results compared with the standard Tikhonov regularization."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["626c9f287523406b88d07165"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"1-5","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["626c9f287523406b88d07165","682c4fb7fdbe83156241cf4e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fb0","mniswId":"7892","title":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","issn":"1545-598X","eissn":"1558-0571","websiteLink":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8859","documentHash":"223d4a67-b2e9-4f04-ba20-2080c2f912ea"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"682c4fb7fdbe83156241cf4d","year":"2025","volume":"22","documentHash":"89088bd3-7f24-425f-a5a3-ffa865f31cb1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747779470436"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"682c5369fdbe83156241f593","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Ziembowicz","documentHash":"34c9b7a3-e5e1-481f-82e4-2f3999f18a42"},{"objectId":"682c5369fdbe83156241f592","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kida","documentHash":"4a188575-932d-4b93-be98-38463720b147"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8bde","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Dytłow","uuid":"163B028E810D6D4B548776C65AAE123CD0C05EC7D6727F59537CC5B1069451284E41E80117AE39A4629F82CA45206ADFE8C77BC1DEA48FA16268CEE6262C86A2","orcidId":"0000-0001-6968-6491","documentHash":"95d8087f-aaeb-4ac7-a6ac-6b3c9ebfe415"}],"objectId":"682c5369fdbe83156241f590","doi":"10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.138493","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0304389425014086?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Examining magnetic susceptibility as a proxy for microplastic pollution in granulometric fractions of road dust: A case study in Warsaw, Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The main objective was to assess the contamination of road dust (RD) with microplastics (MPs) and plasticizers and to investigate whether magnetic susceptibility (χ) can indicate MP pollution. The study employed laser direct infrared (LDIR) imaging with a quantum cascade laser (QCL), magnetic susceptibility measurement using the MFK1-FA Kappabridge, and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). RD collected in Warsaw was divided into the fractions: 0.8 mm (1–0.8 mm), 0.6 mm (0.8–0.6 mm), 0.4 mm (0.6–0.4 mm), 0.2 mm (0.4–0.2 mm), and <0.2 mm. MP analysis revealed materials such as polypropylene and rubber, with the highest number of MPs (51,660 particles) in the <0.2 mm. RD was analyzed for bisphenol A and phthalic acid esters, with the highest concentrations of DEHP and DBP in the <0.2 mm fraction. χ were highest in the fraction <0.2. Strong correlations were found between χ and DEHP (0.78), DBP (0.96), and BPA (0.89) for WAW2 and between χ and MPs (0.97) for WAW4. Strong correlations were also observed for the 0.2 mm and <0.2 mm fractions between χ and DBP. The main conclusion is that χ strongly correlates with DEHP and DBP in the <0.2 mm fraction and with MPs in the 0.2 mm fraction. This study is novel due to the limited research on using χ as a screening method for MP pollution, making it a promising, cost-effective tool for pollution monitoring. The results could support the development of simplified monitoring tools, helping to assess human exposure risks and improve environmental management strategies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii
