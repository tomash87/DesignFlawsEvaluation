A theoretical study is conducted, which aims to identify risk factors in cogeneration projects, based on case studies of such projects in Poland. The study offers a view at CHP (combined heat and power) projects as extremely dependent on the external environment of the organisation. These projects are subject to many external regulations due to their environmental impact and dynamically changing technical aspects. The biggest technical errors occur at the planning and construction stages. The biggest economic and financial risks occur at the execution stage after 2% and 3% of additional design costs occur, respectively. The authors estimated the risks at different stages of the project and concluded that the total cost of failure in correct identification of the risks at the planning stage exceeded PLN 1.5 billion, which amounted to almost 60% of the total additional costs of materialised project risk. Consequently, the biggest challenges in the area of CHP project management at the planning stage are a thorough identification of risks, and the pricing and planning reactions to risk."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f8f5","uid":"bQmdkdjc2fEVOfEB4Ahn06Q","uuid":"224d312f-19b7-4f25-83ea-6ac59c6c2892","name":"Instytut Zarządzania","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a2878c28a0473999a5"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972bf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-16","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a2878c28a0473999a5","6661a0c54097074fa1bcbff2","5e709285878c28a0473972bf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c2dfca2467f057531dd187","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"1","documentHash":"35d7af3b-28f3-4dc0-94a1-73c4071fb0ad"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["czynniki ryzyka","zarządzanie projektami","zarządzanie ryzykiem projektowym","projekty kogeneracyjne"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["risk factors","project management","management project risk","cogeneration projects"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747057582803"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6cbe","name":"MAŁGORZATA","lastName":"ŁĄCKA","uuid":"9AF91CA6000332BEED504FB674EE30EC8BC169635DBE698E3B558AE33331BE79AEBE15BDC3485DC8E6BF50BEC31A131B492877221C508A5FCA0307E0C20C619B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5899-4659","documentHash":"dc4801fa-ac8b-4513-83ce-58b0a814cca8"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c4","name":"MARTA","lastName":"WŁODARCZYK-SIELICKA","uuid":"E2672257D6548CB96A156323A538F169F850F21A9FCDF2CCE6C1D494DF5C18285AB32B3B9087F4704502FEE31B5D7C1D165D35505CD85ED9DCF844B04A45FD6D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7489-8437","documentHash":"e1658e70-952e-4244-bb79-494498fb1350"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397216","name":"IZABELA","lastName":"BODUS-OLKOWSKA","uuid":"695DFA5F274060E776FA8B0D7D04A28F3AB48F092027C6123A3277F2134AC256F2E9660526299BD7DCE881F9512FB9F7E974063D2B84EC911C311E0BAA419FB3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4366-0116","documentHash":"2b1d3665-1483-40c2-99df-c8511769c8a0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2021-08-28","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"61d0cf3c2467f07cfb979b42","doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2021.08.002","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0078323421000750","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The process of modelling the elevation surface of a coastal area using the fusion of spatial data from different sensors","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"niform surface model that will allow for easy and accurate analysis is currently lacking.

Supporting the shaft using a set of rigid supports at the same height limited the ability to detect deviations in the pin axis position and pin profile. Formula for supporting crankshaft measurements was proposed using the results and metrology fundamentals, which allowed the accurate assessment of the geometric state under such conditions. The results provide solutions for measuring large crankshafts while eliminating the imperfections of current shaft measurement techniques. In result a high correlation (correlation coefficent at level 0.9935) with datum-based method was obtained. Therefore it was stated than proposed formula largely eliminates the disadvantages of shaft measurements using V-blocks with rigid supports."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ad878c28a0473aeea8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a047397282","5e709284878c28a047397223"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-10, [nr art.] 110430","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397223","5e7093ad878c28a0473aeea8","5e709285878c28a047397282"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478dd6","mniswId":"14078","title":"Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation","issn":"0263-2241","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"066c10ef-6b87-4756-9477-5fcd8dff8d12"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"630767414097076f71ec15a8","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"189","documentHash":"d5e361b8-e9c0-4d1f-bb89-5b78644f8e1a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Deflections and elastic deformations","Crankshafts","Geometrical deviations","Support conditions","Harmonic analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747057851920"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c351229543c723365444dc","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zmuda Trzebiatowski","uuid":"FA58FF484C2AFF41CD1BC641D3257EDE9FA3718C43CD35B227AC54C2484790313FB3385FF0954E8AF3A55E50E2E8AFA220FBBE675A11771E8F938B738068D0C0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1330-4842","documentHash":"2e0f7c11-bef5-44c0-87a4-2b041636a21d"},{"objectId":"5e709302878c28a0473a105b","name":"ROMA","lastName":"STRULAK-WÓJCIKIEWICZ","uuid":"8C92AA1B80A0E1A8B33038D2BFA2853743E2459C2E07660458E502680B6FD312E49940536498018058F202263B6B3C4E56C1CE6422308191A4733D2334E5AC6A","orcidId":"0000-0002-9702-7554","documentHash":"74fdf136-6273-46ff-b941-dd2193ebe09f"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9a7","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Królikowski","uuid":"F8C1C3F17D842D6F57F4B096BB0E6E864C1D4002F5B184CAACD3D8413CA7E4A849354D006ADF10130E4FFD85B680266842E946C70C23E066C76997FE62145593","orcidId":"0000-0003-0247-6478","documentHash":"38adad5d-e413-455b-b73d-d92d6d2d0715"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a836","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Błażejewski","uuid":"365098FFEF81FBD57326007FB7C2A0A7A820482DD8A61E8F086B8EE227F767263FFC8FB2156FDA8239696A93C8600EF13E7746D68D3432D9A3C2485B2C8F0BF8","orcidId":"0000-0002-5683-4069","documentHash":"3d2e81e7-54f4-49f9-8b6e-dfbbe29ef4af"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a535","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Nikończuk","uuid":"F4D41152332657FEC24D86223FA4CD8E58632E79D709026C414879E5072FC04F28B633692DF87424010DAC12A8F59130868A5EB4979CA94E906DC81D675F8E2C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7809-7653","documentHash":"927fc364-1710-4c99-a34b-48ae1f068252"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"6203c26d2467f03b33814234","doi":"10.35808/ersj/2857","publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/2857","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Additive Production Management in COVID-19 Pandemic","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: The article aims to discuss the authors’ own experiences and literature review on the topic of small communities of additive production in COVID-19 conditions and propose an improvement of emergency procedures in situations of global threat.

Novel approach is to use of Sequential Projection Transformation (SPT) which additionally uses virtual reference points. The transformation coefficients calculated using the virtual points are used to determine the position of the vessels and are also simultaneously used to calibrate the industrial camera.

This paper presents research on a subsea wellhead positioning process for the marking of seabed positions and its subsequent as-built verification. The results indicate that the ultra-short baseline (USBL) acoustic technique can provide static positioning accuracy and precision comparable to those of a long-baseline method (LBL) and significantly reduces the time and cost of the offshore project. The new approach was tested at different stages of the process. First, an innovative offset transformation method, which increases the precision of alignments, was proposed, followed by a step-by-step procedure for determining the positions of marker buoys on the seabed based on spin tests and cardinal heading calibration. Finally, the M−estimation method, which has not yet been applied in subsea engineering, was implemented and proved to be a suitable alternative to the ordinary least squares method."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397253","5e709285878c28a0473972cd","5e709297878c28a04739897e","5e7092ab878c28a04739a3fe"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"195","pagesFromTo":"111155","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972cd","5e709297878c28a04739897e","5e7092ab878c28a04739a3fe","5e709284878c28a047397253"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478dd6","mniswId":"14078","title":"MEASUREMENT","issn":"0263-2241","eissn":"1873-412X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3c98b136-8529-4017-ab07-58fd779444a2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6284d24d40970712d1b63129","year":"2022","volume":"195","documentHash":"ab1b7157-afea-47f2-bcad-d4e3fd1c7a13"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["subsea offshore assets positioning","position estimation","subsea navigation","seafloor mapping"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058120841"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b79a4","name":"TYGRAN","lastName":"DZHUGURYAN","uuid":"9B3C485FE0AB0118D31378D7FB4E7386A88527266EDE5306E9D7A659BE0C1295055C00B7ECDB9A602FC38400C04E0F436D373D3D608E7FC5438F0484CD3AA38E","orcidId":"0000-0001-5613-9448","documentHash":"75806eb5-0e6b-4d8d-a1e8-83c6e015c4ac"},{"objectId":"5e70941f878c28a0473b69c3","name":"KAMIL","lastName":"PĘDZIWIATR","uuid":"4096D2BF24678ACEAF66233740556DE5CC1628786EB64D98BEC4B07977FE7038ADB817C502BA1DDD67B1BB685E6B9A8733BF1A11887F87695EC023484E62924C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5856-9078","documentHash":"b09d4697-8b1c-4a71-98e6-4456d84b06cf"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972de","name":"BOGUSZ","lastName":"WIŚNICKI","uuid":"FDB4CE7E72F1233633E17C80AF596BB2C76676FBEAB8CE0D22254723C9CF4EE0CE9F5024F91CEB5BA04CB2F9901A2AADCE8AABDF77DBA594304D915A812EFAB0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2932-8969","documentHash":"2367c965-7bc4-4748-bbe7-1d8d418a1b10"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739721f","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"DUDEK","uuid":"FAAA9787FF1D3141BC5578B3872357CA0D2790635E5A82969C91C12ADCBB17C62FFCD641CCF3F71D77B70EE3C3E43DB2E3108AC09E33E2F40CED318C1FAA9B12","orcidId":"0000-0002-0003-779X","documentHash":"9ef841ab-4f58-4e47-83a3-d9753a2bbe04"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6287389e4097073b3973e469","doi":"10.3390/en15020488","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/2/488","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Smart Sustainable Production and Distribution Network Model for City Multi-Floor Manufacturing Clusters","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study focuses on management ways within a city multi-floor manufacturing cluster (MFMC).

Therefore, conditions affecting decision-making in the field of production planning by MFMCs and accompanying transports within the agglomeration area with the use of the production-service platform were presented. Assumptions were created for the decision model, allowing for the selection of partners within the MFMC to execute the production order. A simplified decision model using the Hungarian algorithm was proposed, which was verified with the use of test data. The model is universal for material flow analysis and is an assessments basis for smart sustainable supply chain decision-making and planning.

These methods are relatively accurate for straight sections of waterways and less accurate for curves of the waterways. When designing waterways in detail or determining the conditions for their safe operation, more accurate methods (e.g., simulations) are used. However, such studies require relatively large expenditure involving the construction of simulation models of various vessels and water areas, and conducting a real-time simulation experiment with a sufficiently large number of maneuvers performed by highly qualified navigators (pilots, captains). This study deals with the problem of determining the width of safe maneuvering areas of ships on the bends of the waterway based on the results of simulation studies. A new empirical method was developed to determine the width of safe maneuvering areas of loaded bulk carriers passing through fairway bends under deteriorated hydro-meteorological conditions. The method was developed on the basis of a generalization of the results of many simulation experiments carried out at various stages of the Świnoujście–Szczecin fairway reconstruction and a determination of the safe operating conditions for ships passing through the fairway."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397233","5e709285878c28a04739729a","5e709284878c28a047397257"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"6706","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397257","5e709284878c28a047397233","5e709285878c28a04739729a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"629f2bce40970718a38650cd","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"11","documentHash":"f67d51be-c7f7-4f28-a96b-07a627980e00"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["marine simulation","maritime traffic engineering","maritime transport","navigational risk","safety of navigation","maritime transport routes","design of waterways"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058131815"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739dfd1","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"KOGUT","uuid":"5B0C06ED610B72ADC9999A8189EC58450034280A4DF911965EE34C0EF6427633212D72185DA7FA1DEF78797F363EB6F47B7CD3270DA97DE7DCBD76FBAF481DD7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9646-275X","documentHash":"2a6638f6-93e3-4159-8be0-6971fcdca6dd"},{"objectId":"5e7092b2878c28a04739aeb8","name":"Adam","lastName":"Słowik","uuid":"A81E682B64C619C1DA739050E4405F27DE4B13E419DC5335D9A013C3FC03E9F78C7B1A8D42B99CE7DCA692D4FEBF90E4C5DF2A1D297609620C4667C23C78FCCE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2542-9842","documentHash":"46bfdf8b-2028-4b45-97d5-da5a7f7e40dc"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ae3c","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Oberski","uuid":"BE5122987BEE93E4B7C44E6A9B270910D09739E74E85FB7B8F1E5F2545C483885028118089F1450F92FD6C1F2CF13C0A5DE173046828440305F5F81E3352F523","orcidId":"0000-0002-0985-3363","documentHash":"9378fd04-e1a5-4613-87fd-a9afee442912"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972cd","name":"ARKADIUSZ","lastName":"TOMCZAK","uuid":"073A1937B996328768EB350854B9BB5EE6FEA84A23DC0057D8F64CFAF6F3BEA62184A10E0B2F10B37B010BE3C2B68489F9DC0A89D5F0B2D62F16C9E1230436E0","orcidId":"0000-0003-1275-2659","documentHash":"32b874ea-5670-4730-8538-e2ef102620bb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"626667aa4097071c15d9265a","doi":"10.3390/s22093121","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/9/3121","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Seabed Modelling by Means of Airborne Laser Bathymetry Data and Imbalanced Learning for Offshore Mapping","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"An important problem associated with the aerial mapping of the seabed is the precise classification of point clouds characterizing the water surface, bottom, and bottom objects. This study aimed to improve the accuracy of classification by addressing the asymmetric amount of data representing these three groups. A total of 53 Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithms were adjusted and evaluated to balance the amount of data. The prepared data set was used to train the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network used for classifying the point cloud. Data balancing contributed to significantly increasing the accuracy of classification. The best overall classification accuracy achieved varied from 95.8% to 97.0%, depending on the oversampling algorithm used, and was significantly better than the classification accuracy obtained for unbalanced data and data with downsampling (89.6% and 93.5%, respectively). Some of the algorithms allow for 10% increased detection of points on the objects compared to unbalanced data or data with simple downsampling. The results suggest that the use of selected oversampling algorithms can aid in improving the point cloud classification and making the airborne laser bathymetry technique more appropriate for seabed mapping."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d8878c28a04739dfd1","5e709285878c28a0473972cd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b2878c28a04739aeb8","5e7092b1878c28a04739ae3c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"3121","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d8878c28a04739dfd1","5e709285878c28a0473972cd","5e7092b2878c28a04739aeb8","5e7092b1878c28a04739ae3c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"SENSORS","issn":"1424-8220","documentHash":"c8a0faed-8ad8-4c36-9597-a6dc2ad66c22"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"626667fa4097071c15d9278b","year":"2022","volume":"9","number":"22","doi":"","documentHash":"4f754fac-80a5-41c0-835b-daf3dcd5d371"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["airborne laser bathymetry","imbalanced learning","classification","SMOTE","oversampling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145677"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70945b878c28a0473bb36b","name":"RADOSŁAW","lastName":"GORDON","uuid":"BC14FB95D378075C37BC8A4A3153DB5F61467407B793ADB2F3C83159FDA5DACF712205E82184B8A25D58069072D8792FC8B35036C6728B92743592FB661526DB","orcidId":"0000-0001-6340-633X","documentHash":"b973e404-9d99-4945-a00c-fcb706d2386f"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397253","name":"ARTUR","lastName":"BEJGER","uuid":"EB17316B5954E3CAFBD4F2412005CCE991BAE98A0EF070868AF3E5D9884806E950CD0BA57F64F794357B42DF1772A2B07DDDDD996E7D12C9B10089A3C61CB493","orcidId":"0000-0001-5392-1979","documentHash":"6e821e6d-f4ab-4b7c-aa75-398a2a6973d1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62cff73d40970733e79548ef","doi":"10.3390/en15124276","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/12/4276","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of Temperature Change on Acoustic Emission Signal in IGBT Transistors of Marine Propulsion System Converters","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents the results of tests related to failure analysis and finding ways to diagnose used semiconductor elements, among others, in power electronics converter systems on vessels and offshore facilities (drilling and production rigs and wind turbines).

The energy efficiency monitoring system is considered an information support tool for the management process. An object-oriented formalization of monitoring information technology is proposed which has a block structure and contains three categories of classes (information acquisition, calculation algorithms, and control procedures). An example of the implementation of the class “Operation with the electrical grid” of information technology is presented. The planning of the freight EVs charging under power limits of the charging station (CS) was carried out using a situational algorithm based on a Fuzzy expert system. The situational algorithm provides for monitoring the charging of a freight EV at a charging station, taking into account the charge weight index (CWI) assigned to it. The optimization of the CS electrical load is carried out from the standpoint of minimizing electricity costs and ensuring the demand for EV charging without going beyond its limits. A computer simulation of the EV charging mode and the CS load was performed. The results of modeling the electrical grid and CS load using the proposed algorithm were compared with the results of modeling using a controlled charging algorithm with electrical grid limitations and an uncontrolled charging algorithm. The proposed approach provides a reduction in power consumption during peak hours of the electrical grid and charging of connected EVs for an on-demand state of charge (SOC)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942c878c28a0473b79a4","5e709284878c28a047397212"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"3780","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62de840540970762378f63b8","62de840540970762378f63b9","62de840540970762378f63ba","62de840540970762378f63bb","5e709284878c28a047397212","5e70942c878c28a0473b79a4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"627ce1574097075f6793a660","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"10","documentHash":"0cd845d7-5bef-4b96-9932-45a546ab0729"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["smart sustainable city","city multi-floor manufacturing cluster","electric vehicle fleet","smart energy management","energy efficiency monitoring","state of charge","electrical load profile"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159194"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a047397297","name":"JAN","lastName":"MONIETA","uuid":"5126CD6588EC51E96B1493D017947160A0937C6B4EC70C8F68E8206045627308F6C6407B4F63AB006B0B7E5470275189A0785A0CF022D45F1C643E8E323F3BBF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2992-5800","documentHash":"51e85aa9-9cbd-422f-9a89-b61a94515f35"}],"objectId":"62d91e9b40970776cd0ad577","doi":"10.4271/04-15-02-0010","publicUri":"https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/04-15-02-0010/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Application of Image Color Analysis for the Assessment of Injector Nozzle Deposits in Internal Combustion Engines","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article contains the results of operational investigations of deposit formation on external and internal surfaces of injector nozzles of the marine self-ignition engines during their operational use. The aim of this article is to introduce an image analysis method for global assessment of the quantity and quality of injector nozzle deposits in piston internal combustion engines. The components of medium-speed marine engines fueled with distillation and residual fuels were investigated. Digital images of new and used injector nozzles without deposits and with random deposits formed after natural operation on marine ships, respectively, were taken. Macro and microscopy images of external surfaces were taken in a shadowless tent and were illuminated with low-temperature lamps. The characteristic surfaces of the injector nozzles were virtually separated from the white background. The amount and quality of the resulting deposits on individual injector nozzles was determined by means of a global analysis of the blackening degree of gray images and the share of basic RGB (red, green, blue) colors. Basic central statistical measures were applied to assess the deposits of the investigated injector nozzles, and models of wear were developed. There have been archived photographs of the distinguished surfaces of various types of bodies and needles of injector nozzles and results of images analysis performed. This method is an innovative, nondestructive diagnostic technique for the characterization of deposits in internal combustion engines with the use of symptoms expressed in numerical form.

In this connection, criteria of movement safety assessment must be established for manned, unmanned, and autonomous vehicles, bearing in mind the specifics of each transport mode. Distance is one of the basic criteria. In sea transport these include the closest point of approach and ship’s domain understood as an area that should remain free of other objects. The authors examine the relationship between the declared domain and the actually maintained effective domain in a restricted area. They define the coefficient describing this relationship for different ship’s relative bearings in the form of a mathematical function. The formulated relationship allows determining an effective passing distance based on the declared, i.e., assumed passing distance. The determined relationship also enables identification of the declarative domain based on the effective one. These relationships may be used in decision support systems of manned ships, in remote ship control centres and decision-making systems of autonomous ships for the assessment of ship movement safety, planning collision avoidance manoeuvres and generation of safe trajectories."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972d3","5e709239878c28a047391eb9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"4","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972d3","5e709239878c28a047391eb9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","issn":"1932-6203","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"45cf93d6-1d2d-4b95-93ed-f1e3f136e1c7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62556eec2467f052bcab125d","year":"2022","volume":"17","number":"4","documentHash":"13308194-f933-416b-8a24-b0075ae39a0b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["decision support","maritime transport","navigational safety assessment","ship domain"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159463"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62d7f338409707188cab2157","name":"Aleksandr","lastName":"Efimov","documentHash":"bb6027e8-f2e0-467c-90aa-c4b8ed0ed560"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397278","name":"ARKADIUSZ","lastName":"NERĆ","uuid":"9CE279AB5D215F7F9B6B7357365E2CA5658B6C9FC33FA791F88A65A26157EB9EA98726EDE03275C3E0A2B91C6763269726978E1D17C59DC5455A41957FC6D510","orcidId":"0000-0003-1875-1331","documentHash":"50de171d-b709-47f2-9454-43edec93cec0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62d7f338409707188cab214c","doi":"10.17402/497","publicUri":"http://repository.scientific-journals.eu/handle/123456789/2702","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Sliding mode control system for an active current converter","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, a functional diagram for an automatic sliding mode control system for a three-phase bridge buck current converter was developed.

The land of Szczecin is made up of organic soils, covered in many places by water (lagoons, rivers, and lakes), which are susceptible to displacement; therefore, benchmarks in this area are susceptible to changes in height. The analysis of the geological structure of the near-surface layer of the Szczecin area, such as organic soils, sands, and clays, was carried out. The detailed recognition of geological structure in connection with height changes of benchmarks made it possible to locate stable benchmarks in the researched area. In the first step, the authors chose benchmarks in a stable geological structure based on archive data from the Polish Geodesy Documentation Center. In the second step, precise GNSS 3D measurements were performed in the direct vicinity of these benchmarks in order to verify their stability.

A mature comparative analysis is performed to achieve enhancement of the injection and liquid jet breakup characteristics of microalgae oil (MAO100) at an elevated temperature of up to 80 °C. To obtain reliable data, the following experimental tasks were performed and qualitatively described to identify the (i) distribution of Sauter mean diameter (SMD) d32 of fuel droplets within the temporal evolution of a fuel jet, (ii) dynamics and topology dependencies of the liquid jet atomization and droplet breakup, (iii) dynamic formation of the liquid jet structure, and (iv) character and peculiarities of liquid jet breakup. The results of the research have shown the presence of zones distinguished by very intense droplet breakup, which carried out a robust individual character that does not depend on the type and temperature of the fuel. Furthermore, the preheated MAO100 was dominant (~ 70%) with droplets of the following size, d ≤ 40–50 μm (~ 20%) and d ≤ 120 μm (~ 50%), who were 1.2 to 1.5 smaller compared to those obtained at 20 °C. At t = 2 ms after injection of MAO100 (80 °C), the presence of droplets which radiuses exceed 500 μm was prevented. This tendency is ideally comparable to the one for a diesel fuel that, in turn, supports the hypothesis that the physical contribution to the ignition delay and hence to the entire process of combustion could be effectively controlled by the preheating route."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a04739726b","5e709285878c28a047397295"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["628736c54097073b3973de10","5e709284878c28a04739726b","628736c54097073b3973de12","5e709285878c28a047397295","628736c54097073b3973de14"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bb68","mniswId":"2473","title":"Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery","issn":"2190-6815","eissn":"2190-6823","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"f5f3947b-49dd-4938-a31b-4bf16a0ee49d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"628736c64097073b3973de16","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"1","documentHash":"81a52d73-db85-47a9-8067-7388b76c6a7f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sauter mean diameter","microalgae oil","liquid jet","droplet breakup","oil preheating","ignition dealy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058162906"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62f233be409707569c02c5d0","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Ignalewski","documentHash":"16ed51af-bd04-4bae-82c7-6ee448ceb59e"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b81ae","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"KALBARCZYK-JEDYNAK","uuid":"25AC1644194D3C29AEB2D0A88B383C512A96F8BF9EC0CA7C0C1C43B96DA14628AB75EB50E1627C982D1A1969BDD0E9B5AE95A55CD2E32F3899F2D6BC26FFE6CB","orcidId":"0000-0001-7513-4837","documentHash":"82d9c156-2ea0-41a5-bcd2-bf6a1919803b"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a489","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kaup","uuid":"C7F6842B24AE7D851F746BB317ABD52367EC9B1CC6B9DC784405E574DA9ED7375446845C4B5D17E7606D6CCAAE8E648B9B63E7267FBFCF47422FA0035E2E2F7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9384-8144","documentHash":"488c8c4d-34b8-4f07-9c8f-5bbc32d1ed8a"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972eb","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"ŚLĄCZKA","uuid":"759D7BBB207B434EFA81A5CA6F08F7D206BED69E025A0F821F004076FA7A0CDD9783E41F2B94B43A5AE5CF41E1690AD8A01EDD81784FB6469F9F64AD37799A08","orcidId":"0000-0003-3265-9726","documentHash":"c3a0236f-a4c1-4ffe-8618-771c3f20fc03"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972a1","name":"DOROTA","lastName":"ŁOZOWICKA","uuid":"85EE5CFFF61AB9BE949BB56FF018079F02B7F53F552E7DF3554357916CA1B9241246E4C28186859FF3AE2E6B7BE02E100CD805210DA896BF70CB38E28CC6CC94","orcidId":"0000-0001-8031-762X","documentHash":"274988a9-acff-4f39-9d75-2dcf133e53d0"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397237","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"CHORAB","uuid":"5BFB2FEF8AEAC1CCB19C9ABA7770CB62031DAC694E837E942A1041ED93743E174BA194E022AF77BEE734A21023A43D2D300C4B2D9BE7B1E35104A272125E8EE4","orcidId":"0000-0001-6595-7450","documentHash":"bf1eaa95-7d02-486d-9d85-e617fd364a00"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62f233be409707569c02c5ce","doi":"10.24136/tren.2022.002","publicUri":"http://economic-research.pl/Journals/index.php/tren/article/view/2083","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The concept of the agro cargo supply chain model using inland navigation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Making transport sentences requires taking into account many external and internal factors dependent on changes taking place on the shipping market.

The aim of the article is to present and analyze the concept of the agro cargo supply chain model using inland navigation, in the relations between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany on the example of the Capital Group OT Logistics S.A.

Each supply chain model includes only certain selected factors that have a limited impact on the volatility of the transport. It is not possible to build a model that would fully recreate the behavior of the object, with all possible external influences. The article considers the optimization model of inland wheat transport to final consumers, which predicts a constant demand for cereal loads in certain time segments.

Analiza dostępnej literatury dotyczącej problemu pozwala stwierdzić, że stosowane obecnie metody wyznaczania mocy indykowanej obarczone są wysoką niepewnością, sięgającą nawet 5–8% wartości zmierzonej. Zaproponowano, aby strumień energii przekazywanej od gazu roboczego do układu tłokowo-korbowego silnika wyznaczany był jako iloczyn siły gazowej i prędkości tłoka, w miejsce stosowanego obecnie iloczynu ciśnienia i zmiany objętości przestrzeni roboczej. Zastosowanie bezpośredniego pomiaru prędkości lub położenia tłoka pracującego silnika ma na celu poprawę dokładności wyznaczania mocy indykowanej. Opracowano metodykę wyznaczania mocy indykowanej na podstawie pomiaru ciśnienia gazu roboczego i prędkości tłoka. Zaproponowano metodykę szacowania niepewności wyznaczonej mocy indykowanej zarówno dla dotychczas stosowanej metody wyznaczania mocy indykowanej, nazwanej w skrócie metodą Watta, jak i dla nowej metody, nazwanej w rozprawie metodą obserwacyjną. Zaprojektowano cykl eksperymentów biernych na czterosuwowym silniku okrętowym typu 8 RDV 136. Zarejestrowane dane posłużyły do wyznaczenia mocy indykowanej metodą Watta i metodą obserwacyjną. Obliczone wyniki oraz ich niepewności porównano ze sobą. W celu realizacji programu badań zaprojektowano i zbudowano układ detekcji położenia tłoka obejmujący około 75% zakresu jego skoku. Opracowano metodę aproksymacji prędkości kątowej wału korbowego za pomocą funkcji ciągłej. Opracowano metodę wyznaczania funkcji ciągłej, aproksymującej prędkość tłoka na podstawie zmierzonych położeń pracującego tłoka oraz funkcji aproksymującej prędkość kątową wału korbowego wraz ze zmierzonym przebiegiem zmian ciśnienia gazu roboczego. Pozwoliło to na wyznaczenie strumienia energii przekazywanej tłokowi oraz mocy indykowanej cylindra. Weryfikacji wyników dokonano poprzez porównanie GMP tłoka wyznaczonego metodą obserwacyjną oraz GMP tłoka uzyskanego ze znacznika położenia wału korbowego, ze wzorcowym GMP tłoka określonego czujnikiem położenia tłoka zainstalowanym w głowicy cylindra. Otrzymane wyniki pozwoliły stwierdzić, że GMP tłoka wyznaczone metodą obserwacyjną jest bliższe GMP wzorcowemu w porównaniu do wskazań czujnika położenia wału korbowego. Poprawa była zależna od obciążenia silnika i wynosiła od 1 do 2,3 OWK. Wartości mocy indykowanych wyznaczonych metodami Watta i obserwacyjną różniły się, aczkolwiek różnice te mieściły się w zakresie uzyskanych niepewności pomiarów. Na tej podstawie postawioną w rozprawie tezę uznano za zweryfikowaną pozytywnie."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397277"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397277"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"978-83-64434-38-9","pages":130,"translation":false,"publicationPlace":"Szczecin","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb778","mniswId":"11300","name":"Akademia Morska w Szczecinie","documentHash":"cd457f72-563e-49a6-9a9b-0d70cbc60ea5"},"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["silnik okrętowy","spalinowy silnik okrętowy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058175719"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"654a097c40970749a84dc5df","name":"Brodziński","lastName":"Kacper","documentHash":"c2a5c584-bcf5-4998-9727-763e334b5a03"},{"objectId":"654a097c40970749a84dc5de","name":"Welter","lastName":"Christopher","documentHash":"29b8a978-ed13-4baa-8e29-cf8c52ad9f25"},{"objectId":"654a097c40970749a84dc5dd","name":"Dymek","lastName":"Mateusz","documentHash":"7a903cbb-fd87-4e5f-86d0-f64c047db774"},{"objectId":"654a097c40970749a84dc5dc","name":"Fernandes","lastName":"Fabio A.

The heat of combustion and heating values have been measured in laboratory conditions using an automatic calorimeter. The results show a slight decline in energy properties, with a change of 3.45 % on average. An image analysis has been used to evaluate the effects of ageing and combustion quality to compare the two fuels. The main purpose of research on rapeseed oil methyl esters in relation to diesel oil was to determine the energy properties of the tested fuels, i.e., the heat of combustion and the heating value. The side aims of research were to determine selected functional properties of the tested fuels. Changes in density, kinematic viscosity, acid value and water content at the beginning and end of the experiment have also been examined. Deposits formed after combustion in a calorimetric bomb in crucibles and on the injector nozzles in a self-ignition engine have been examined with the use of the weight method and images analysis. After a long period of storage, density, and acid number of rapeseed oil methyl esters have been slightly changed, while kinematic viscosity and water content increased significantly to exceed the limit values. The acid value of diesel oil increased by 75% as a result of natural deterioration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a047397297"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"330","pagesFromTo":"125606","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a047397297","6311b6bb409707352b68d1af","6311b6bb409707352b68d1b0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d7a","mniswId":"6898","title":"FUEL","issn":"0016-2361","documentHash":"0ff5c7e0-65e8-4826-b8b2-522236e1b051"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6311b6bb409707352b68d1ae","year":"2022","volume":"330","documentHash":"3c86caa3-ac6e-49f2-b09d-e07ec962a49e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Diesel oil","Durability assessment","Heating value","Image analysis","Natural deterioration","Rapeseed oil methyl esters"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199660"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739724d","name":"JOANNA","lastName":"KASIŃSKA","uuid":"B4E0A8899DC5DF6180DED50B27D6113D29BFD73132A418DDEE8F7B7878267CB2FFE6554C0A936CB800B48982B8494291BC49C93DD4CAA0BF4250DBFAE8DF5AE0","orcidId":"0000-0001-6371-8341","documentHash":"f816dfc3-d254-40cd-8d5f-98dc1cd4d203"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397229","name":"VIOLETTA","lastName":"JENDRYCZKA","uuid":"54FA5B29F3D2F248932639851B56D4839C6448A4084A9173FD08F3CE2F4F9042E3BD2C76D7214C7E722F97B272C0D704F968F2A9DDFDD523F58E96830FD80B82","orcidId":"0000-0002-0717-6047","documentHash":"fe65fa0f-dbdc-4a27-ba55-23cc805acb82"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6311baee409707352b694677","doi":"10.3390/su141710882","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/17/10882/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Determinants of COVID-19 Infections on Sea-Going Ships and Their Socio-Economic Consequences for Seafarers and Shipowners in Terms of Modeling Ship Emergency Procedures","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many negative socio-economic consequences for seafarers and shipowners of such importance that, on the one hand, it inspired and, on the other hand, it became an impulse to undertake research in this direction. It seems that avoiding at least some consequences would be possible if both shipowners and ship masters operated based on safety management procedures strictly adapted to the pandemic situation. Of course, many crisis management procedures have been developed in maritime practice so far. Still, they mainly relate to such events as maritime incidents, maritime accidents, maritime disasters, oil spills, terrorist attacks, or sea piracy. However, they do not consider the specificity of a crisis situation created for the safety of the ship’s crew by the global pandemic. Its appearance made all maritime transport entities, especially shipowners, aware of the lack of preparation for such an eventuality. Based on the general recommendations of international organizations, such as the WHO (World Health Organization) or the IMO (International Maritime Organization), they began developing and implementing urgent procedures for handling ships under COVID-19 conditions. Since the recommendations were formulated generally and the pandemic spread very quickly, the prevention and response procedures for a ship found to be affected by COVID-19 were developed ad hoc and, therefore, were often flawed. Consequently, it was concluded that it is worth creating a universal model of the procedure for dealing with a sea-going ship in pandemic conditions and reducing the adverse socio-economic consequences for shipowners and seafarers. This became the primary goal of the research undertaken in this direction, and this goal was closely related to the adopted central research hypothesis. The substance of the matter comes down to the fact that knowledge of the factors causing coronavirus infections will allow the development and implementation of effective procedures for handling ships in pandemic conditions. It will also reduce the risk and consequences of coronavirus infections. COVID-19 infections can be caused by many factors that are beyond the control of the shipowner and the ship’s captain. Still, there are also those factors that they can control and thus eliminate or at least reduce the risk of contracting the coronavirus by the crew. Thus, their correct identification, ranking their importance in terms of the risk of infection, and then focusing on the elimination of the most important of them is the basis for building a universal model, in the sense of the possibility of applying to any sea-going ship in pandemic conditions. The work includes RCA (Root Cause Analysis), stratification analysis, weighted Ishikawa diagram, and Lorenz-Pareto chart. The primary sources of information used in the research came from the literature review, the analysis of normative acts, the analysis of documentation and procedures on board ships in pandemic conditions, questionnaire research, direct and focus interviews, and participant observation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397229","5e709284878c28a04739724d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"10882","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a04739724d","5e709284878c28a047397229"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"630c5fc94097076f7169294e","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"14","number":"17","documentHash":"7ebe274f-0b9b-4e39-a306-41f400a999cd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lorenzo curve in maritime transport","stratification analysis","ship management","ship","captain","COVID-19 pandemic in maritime transport","crisis management in maritime transport"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199713"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397273","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"MĄKA","uuid":"32196EF592F7563D17EFCA642F762F53E0F35E549328424C7A01B0201D69D57C0EC2834E1AE4D87AC0A2E1B697B31E14FA10965B965C6DC71161279F0F3AB156","orcidId":"0000-0002-1477-2445","documentHash":"38b4b17a-1c45-41d3-8835-865e9dd18a21"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397251","name":"MARIUSZ","lastName":"DRAMSKI","uuid":"8740D09A875C0281C61F3371B9F5F147FF90828F65DA6AB9CF2C57EB938301CEA5C8FE5328A0B27AD7838C465D5F2F84984C559E2A2B41852666F9C008F0EDC2","orcidId":"0000-0001-5334-1384","documentHash":"c16a0eac-a6bd-40f9-ae04-6c8f1521051c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"6311c578409707352b697f54","doi":"10.35808/ersj/2981","publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/2981","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Alternative Dimensional Reduction Methods on the Example of Data Preprocessing to Build a Ship Exhaust Model","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Systems modeling is one of the basic research methods in scientific human activity. It should also be mentioned that the modeled systems are often multidimensional, which is an additional serious obstacle. Richard Bellman formulated the concept of the \"dimensional curse\" which says that as the dimensionality of a system increases, difficulties increase geometrically. In this article, the authors consider the problem of dimensionality reduction in order to build a model of the ship's exhaust emissions. It was observed that some data are incomplete or have little impact on the baseline variables. Design/methodology/approach: Two methods of dimensionality reduction were applied (Pearson's linear correlation index and arc-angle index) and their suitability for this process was discussed. Findings: Thanks to the methods used, it was possible to obtain information on the significance level of each of the model inputs. In addition, a lot depends on context, data availability, and much more. In any case, it is worth doing research in this direction. Practical implications: We deal with modeling mainly in cases when we need to rely on measurement data, and the modeled system itself is unknown to us. The only thing the researcher has at his disposal is a certain set of measurement data, which very often lacks metadata. Nevertheless, even the basic information about input and output data allows you to create a model. However, the problem may be too much data. Although their storage itself is nothing difficult at present, the same sending them using means of communication (e.g. sending via the Internet) may already be troublesome. Originality value: Typically, in the analysis of significance, methods that take into account the value of variance are used. Such a method is, for example, PCA (principal component analysis) (Sorzano 2014, Scholkopf 1997). The originality of the approach described in the article, however, consists in building a ranking of the significance of individual variables."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397273","5e709284878c28a047397251"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"XXV","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"587-596","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397251","5e709284878c28a047397273"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dc39","mniswId":"22361","title":"European Research Studies Journal","issn":"1108-2976","eissn":"1108-2976","documentHash":"ee72860c-86eb-4a56-a31b-70fc70a07123"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c2bc8b40970721cb8f52d6","year":"2022","volume":"XXV","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"79db1a71-5362-4172-9229-1a10c063cb61"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Curse of dimensionality","exhaust emission","correlation","arc-angle index","dimensionality reduction","data dimensions","Pearson’s correlation coefficient"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199868"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6576cfbc4097071b8ef9f467","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kania","documentHash":"644d1b6b-adfa-4611-90bf-c32246240f52"},{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1b3d","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ekiert","uuid":"A71EF22CD65F26D34EFB2C5635B72ADC74BE05962AAD74D582A1336863ED56802F0FA50F394CEA92C8D68546630D3E5883E7412990C8D228254EF492AF707228","orcidId":"0000-0002-8403-2119","documentHash":"f41cd233-3610-4c57-be5d-82f52b148acd"},{"objectId":"5e709302878c28a0473a0ffa","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"DBD3B88B8844D71E820B3493ADBFFA72F69F41787B694E930B07D8139B632321F4E9E764C8AD6D60E7DA44D29F46B7B82F17E6E28C150C7FD0D3F924695E1A39","orcidId":"0000-0001-8903-6322","documentHash":"bc8bc8b8-a7de-4374-92ab-b2799b600808"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a546","name":"RADOSŁAW","lastName":"RUTKOWSKI","uuid":"7F99F8449AD37AA6099F83B45C1EAAA681CA8B232EA0EDFE57AD1069A35B5788CDC2ED0F615FB0C66308AAA9D1F6E40C38C45CF759090CDE36E0749CC4397358","orcidId":"0000-0002-0067-6751","documentHash":"7d7c01f7-d42b-4148-bfc8-5e75f2193a3b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62d008b040970733e7969ff9","doi":"10.3390/ma15020552","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/2/552","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Research and TLS (LiDAR) Construction Diagnostics of Clay Brick Masonry Arched Stairs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study presents the terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) diagnostic of the clay brick masonry arched staircase in a historic building.

Therefore, the primary objective of this paper was to assess the perception of urban mobility problems and freight solutions from the perspective of city users, considering the point of view of Brazilian and Polish city dwellers. The work was based on a survey realised in Belo Horizonte (Brazil) and Szczecin (Poland). The analysis identified the similarities and differences between the perceptions of different resident groups in both cities. The practical advantage of this research is the establishment of a set of recommendations for city decision-makers in the context of residents’ perceptions and their expectations regarding the implementation of urban freight measures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972ad","5e709284878c28a047397203"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"710","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972ad","62d00be140970733e796c09d","62d00be140970733e796c09e","5e709284878c28a047397203"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":"10.3390/en","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"073c6b4f-b994-4710-8065-02d74e1e73ce"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e6eab52467f030e8c433a6","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"3","documentHash":"6f6ef340-c61f-44fb-8d93-a045bc59a21f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["urban freight transport","urban mobility","sustainable transportation","stakeholders","residents","Plackett-Luce model"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058200252"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972eb","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"ŚLĄCZKA","uuid":"759D7BBB207B434EFA81A5CA6F08F7D206BED69E025A0F821F004076FA7A0CDD9783E41F2B94B43A5AE5CF41E1690AD8A01EDD81784FB6469F9F64AD37799A08","orcidId":"0000-0003-3265-9726","documentHash":"c3a0236f-a4c1-4ffe-8618-771c3f20fc03"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a04739729a","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"PRZYWARTY","uuid":"AF3736DE6F3EB70EC44DA9DD9788243A72254E26027995FBB294F2D1E6075CE6A09082C03F56AD6A9F5314B215431642C80A50385A7EE4232C0A09BA56C1B445","orcidId":"0000-0002-2438-7073","documentHash":"e932335c-40ed-4b06-b512-7035e758976d"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397257","name":"STANISŁAW","lastName":"GUCMA","uuid":"067D323C978A04E1738FD3BC990629D6DB66E1134907156F45ED7EBFF883954C1045402D167DB85E389F84A0A20BCA4DBEB482ECC97A5C0D2869B99BC8D61524","orcidId":"0000-0003-2286-8815","documentHash":"ea30d09e-fba1-4b99-93c5-db818862f72d"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397233","name":"RAFAŁ","lastName":"GRALAK","uuid":"675B730A73A3886C5465DAE098CBBE4D9DA6F3481C56156DF0E7B65F981B377319DDC6C482DF962851D52C717E87CE3DA1B36BB04715AC4A2E3459D2021FF542","orcidId":"0000-0003-0330-2197","documentHash":"b1e6f039-55fd-4a93-868c-721603c26f71"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62d9472640970776cd0ce41e","doi":"10.3390/app12083868","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/8/3868","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Maximum Safe Parameters of Outbound Loaded Vessels for Wind Turbine Installation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A paper presents problems related to the safe operation of wind turbine installation vessels in port waterways.

Problem: The safety of navigation in port waterways is the basic restrictions for the construction of harbors (terminals) to handle ships used for the construction of OWT and for increasing their size. Navigational risk is a criterion of navigational safety assessment that allows its accurate estimation in port waterways. Method: The article presents the method for dimensioning port waterways for ships serving offshore sea wind turbine transport and construction. Furthermore, a method for determining the navigational risk of jack-up vessels navigating in port waterway areas is presented. Results: The authors have determined conditions for safe operation of these ships in restricted areas and defined the basic condition of navigational safety. The presented method of navigational risk analysis refers to the departure of a loaded ship carrying offshore wind turbine components in the presently designed port terminal in Świnoujście for handling offshore wind farm projects. Conclusion: These are universal methods that can be applied to the design of ports serving vessels that install offshore wind turbines in various types of waters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397233","5e709284878c28a047397257"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"70","issue":"142","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397257","5e709284878c28a047397233"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a6e6","mniswId":"18270","title":"Scientific Journals of the Maritime University of Szczecin-Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii Morskiej w Szczecinie","issn":"1733-8670","eissn":"2392-0378","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fdb820fa-cedd-41fe-95cd-b3a078aeeee6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d92b9d40970776cd0b64b0","year":"2022","volume":"70","number":"142","documentHash":"617539e3-25ef-4074-a950-dfa64ff265f4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["offshore wind farms","offshore wind turbine","offshore wind turbine installation terminal","wind turbine installation vessel","wind turbine transport vessel"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058207431"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62f37e22409707058d1c0d61","name":"A.","lastName":"Penkina","documentHash":"d8300ec2-1a8f-41aa-88b4-9883f7f01673"},{"objectId":"62f37e22409707058d1c0d60","name":"M.T.","lastName":"John","documentHash":"28030318-0f08-4fa6-ac96-fc85ce164d25"},{"objectId":"62f37e22409707058d1c0d5f","name":"P.","lastName":"Shirvel","documentHash":"ab067a6b-7cec-4fb4-a294-035375e68ba2"},{"objectId":"62f37e22409707058d1c0d5e","name":"A.","lastName":"Iakimovitch","documentHash":"5c6b4284-e259-4f7b-8759-bbc4bc9cf14c"},{"objectId":"62f37e22409707058d1c0d5d","name":"S.","lastName":"Dounaru","documentHash":"3f2b65f2-816f-4fa3-b3aa-b7dd0cf5df4c"},{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b85d1","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"JAKUBOWSKI","uuid":"CCDC672652B5979C070593104E7F61E3F9DFB4D71AC214D176A3584072B4A5CF26B3BA1B614FB309DA57D91BF340D5403327EF2A25F782A86A8510EE2CCA9656","orcidId":"0000-0002-0331-3147","documentHash":"55041fe5-3c7d-4c5c-b2f1-627564d5ae6b"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"}],"objectId":"62f37e22409707058d1c0d5b","publicUri":"https://rep.bntu.by/handle/data/110978","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Fea-audit and local redesign of practice-proved laboratory centrifuge machine","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Centrifuge is a good knew type of machines for liquid separation.

Dynamic and multidirectional technical and technological processes introduce a new level of changes in urban space, adapting it to the present and future requirements of its inhabitants in a sustainable manner. An important infrastructure element of the urban space is the crosswalk, being an inseparable element of everyday life in the city. As part of a clear emphasis on the issue of vulnerable road users’ protection, the aim of the article is to examine the perception of users regarding crosswalks in Poland, based on the example of Szczecin. The main aim of the article is to identify the dimensions of crosswalk perception. The specific objectives include the determination of the state of knowledge about the essence and typology of crosswalks and the identification of good practices in their designation. Literature analysis, questionnaire research, and a case study were used. In the adopted research methodology, the use of the questionnaire made it possible to identify key intersections (Five Stars), each different in their form, and to learn about the perception dimensions of this element of urban space. In the context of the Smart City concept implementation, the perception of crosswalks by young city residents, i.e., the “iGeneration”, was examined. The obtained results allowed to perform a systematic analysis that focuses on individual behavioral aspects and subjectivism of the assessment of crosswalks in comparison with the commonly dominant architectural, engineering, and legal perspectives. The research allowed to assess the topology of intersections as well as the indication of safety improvement recommendation lists, taking into account intergenerational optics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709295878c28a04739878d","5e7091f7878c28a04738dce2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"15","pagesFromTo":"5661","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091f7878c28a04738dce2","5e709295878c28a04739878d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e104ad40970720e718196b","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"15","documentHash":"9b409fd9-b0fd-4c50-96e8-fb39f3e79a07"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["smart city","crosswalk","VSS SN 640 241 standard"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058214518"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b04","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"GĄSOWSKI","uuid":"C33A26636B06740F243F2D5D36CB0E2720806B4AA7239794C5EC503FE8C8CDADE907ADC70283B5222F7F38709ED59EF0A0FA327D5B3C39642FB9096FB1DCF237","orcidId":"0000-0001-6804-8324","documentHash":"a3c83c0b-3a4f-47f6-883c-18a8c3d9407b"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b03","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"CZAPLIŃSKI","uuid":"844F267D9C9B971B9D58542EC91195B34E40FE02E781EA5F0DEC54BBB0DC53BE70EB9CBF02DD170270A915856204E28EE98EA4EB10FDE79E9621D258B81E2E1E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9503-4742","documentHash":"e66d2444-0ee7-4541-9938-266c8042d443"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62e7897940970778ffa6d0c9","doi":"10.17402/522","publicUri":"https://repository.am.szczecin.pl/handle/123456789/2721","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Performance of AIS geoinformation extraction using SQL and NoSQL TranStat databases","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Automatic Identification System (AIS) device is mandatory for ships that comply with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). AIS is intended for vessel traffic monitoring to improve shipping safety. In the examined area, the base station received 22 128 345 messages in April 2019. Approximately 80% of these messages included position reports, which were subjected to geospatial analysis. One possible utilization of AIS messages is used in an intelligent maritime transport statistics production system called TranStat in the Gospostrateg project. This specific study compares the speed of executing geospatial queries in a relational PostgreSQL database engine and a non-relational MongoDB database engine. For the purpose of this research, we have defined four AIS datasets, four test polygons of varied number of vertices, and a reference point on a fairway. The tests were used to assess the execution of the queries in a database that returns the number of ships located in a predefined area and the number of ships located at a preset distance from the defined point. It has been determined from the test results that test queries are performed faster and data stored in the database occupy less disk space in MongoDB than in PostgreSQL. Faster geospatial analysis of AIS messages may improve the navigation safety by earlier detection of dangerous situations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7b03"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"71","issue":"143","pagesFromTo":"93-101","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7b03","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b04"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a6e6","mniswId":"18270","title":"Scientific Journals of the Maritime University of Szczecin-Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii Morskiej w Szczecinie","issn":"1733-8670","eissn":"2392-0378","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fdb820fa-cedd-41fe-95cd-b3a078aeeee6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e7897940970778ffa6d0ce","year":"2022","volume":"71","number":"143","documentHash":"f417f9cd-0dba-477d-ac4d-613136dc362a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["AIS","database","spatial","geospatial"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058214628"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af498","name":"PAULINA","lastName":"HATŁAS-SOWIŃSKA","uuid":"9E8FB981EDC8A772F3D3CD09057D89576C28CD2899A2B1CC8A185127D058FF5F5BDBCB78831012896F3AF806A134231C4EC461D8E4F7641EB4939DEE1679EC19","orcidId":"0000-0002-5761-2994","documentHash":"5d1e5e19-2894-476b-a0e9-f7ae09a7fd5f"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972d3","name":"MIROSŁAW","lastName":"WIELGOSZ","uuid":"D5DA71FE039FE94ADA12D6EB4673C88AB2AE064C97C33707C84AA841621BDC4A78872E9977E9FFD0B8AADC0C74EE6201C6C2B505BEA3A8FE500A1E1F77FC64B1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3113-5018","documentHash":"24582178-134c-426d-95e6-5429e07183ce"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-08-01","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62f252de409707569c04c272","doi":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.111941","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002980182201277X","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Ontology based approach in solving collision situations at sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents an innovative approach to the implementation of semi-automatic communication in solving collision situations at sea based on navigational and communication ontology. Data used in this process are obtained from navigational systems and equipment, including AIS, ARPA and ECDIS. The problem of communication processes management has been analysed. Based on this, navigational and communication ontology has been developed and presented. The construction of ontology takes into account, inter alia, IMO's Standard Marine Communication Phrases. The developed ontology allows the implementation of communication processes as the concatenation of sequences of words corresponding to utterances used by humans. The use of the said ontology in the process of semi-automatic communication may contribute to the reduction of errors in communication and facilitate communication to those with poor English skills. The developed ontology was used to support solving collision situations at sea. Examples of its use in real and simulated cases are presented. The authors made use of official reports of marine accident investigation boards and own scenarios simulating typical situations of ship encounters. The results of research will be used to create an automatic communication system for manned and autonomous ships."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972d3","5e7093b1878c28a0473af498"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"260","pagesFromTo":"111941","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b1878c28a0473af498","5e709285878c28a0473972d3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c2","mniswId":"15344","title":"Ocean Engineering","issn":"0029-8018","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"1769a8a1-e28e-487a-8470-bf6196654271"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62f252de409707569c04c273","year":"2022","volume":"260","documentHash":"ad278295-86c9-41b6-a112-dbe93ceb7bf8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["collision situation","navigational safety","ontology of communication","ontology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058214655"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"}],"objectId":"62f3a26c409707058d1d67aa","publicUri":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/search?query=any,contains,Eksplozje%20w%20skrzyniach%20korbowych%20silnik%C3%B3w%20okr%C4%99towych%20%E2%80%93%20przyczyny,%20zapobieganie%20i%20minimalizacja%20skutk%C3%B3w&tab=LibraryCatalog&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&offset=0","type":"BOOK","typeName":"Książka","year":2022,"title":"Eksplozje w skrzyniach korbowych silników okrętowych – przyczyny, zapobieganie i minimalizacja skutków","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W pracy przedstawiono syntezę zagadnień związanych z wybuchami w skrzyniach korbowo-tłokowych spalinowych silników okrętowych.

This paper discusses an approach to the implementation of energy-intensive technological processes in such clusters using examples of the manufacturing of ceramic and metal–ceramic products. The manufacturing of ceramic and metal–ceramic products in high-temperature furnaces is associated with an increased electricity consumption. The use of modern ceramic micro- and nanopowders makes it possible to switch to more energy-saving technologies by reducing the sintering temperature and shortening the technological cycle. This requires the use of additional activating and inhibiting additives in the initial powder mixtures to obtain products with the necessary physical and mechanical properties. The purpose of this paper is to present a model and indicators to assess the energy efficiency of the choice of sintering technology of foam ceramic filters for smart sustainable production management within CMFMCs. The use of the proposed indicators for assessing the energy efficiency of sintering foam ceramic filters makes it possible to improve the technological process and reduce the completion time of its thermal cycle by 19%, and reduce the maximum heating temperature by 20% to 1350 °C. The adoption of a different oxide technological alternative and the use of the proposed model and indicators to assess the energy efficiency of the sintering technology of foam ceramic filters allows to choose less energy-intensive equipment and save up to 40% in electricity. The proposed model to assess the energy efficiency of the sintering technology of foam ceramic filters can be used to control their production under the power consumption limitations within the CMFMCs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

Samples were subjected to axial dynamic crushing force with the same initial energy 1700 J. Based on the course of force values, the crush efficiency indices were determined. The paper also presents a comparative analysis in the form of numerical simulations using the finite element method. The results for profiles filled with foam of length 40 mm − 200 mm at 20 mm intervals are tabulated to determine the effect of foam length on the behavior of the energy absorber.

The dependencies that describe the loss of energy in combustion engines and injection apparatus are presented. Currently, very little can be found in the literature on the study of frictional forces in injection apparatus, but mainly in the piston–cylinder group, so this work significantly fills that gap. The aim of this article is to construct a device and to develop a method for assessing the technical state of injector nozzles to minimize friction losses in internal combustion engines at the stages of evaluation, design, production and operation. This article presents a stand for determining the maximum friction forces due to gravity loading by water-jet control. This article also presents test results on the maximum friction force between a needle and a body of injector nozzles in piston combustion engines on a designed and purpose-built stand outside of the combustion engine. Various designs and injector nozzles are made from various types of alloy steel for marine and automotive piston internal combustion engines fueled with distillation or residual fuels, and are tested. The research concerned conventional elements for the injection apparatus as well as electronically controlled subsystems. Precision pairs of injection equipment are selected for the tests: new ones are employed after the storage period and operated in natural conditions. The elements dismantled from the internal combustion engines are tested in the presence of fuel or calibration oil of similar properties. The maximum static frictional forces under the hydrostatic loading are measured, alongside the parameters for the dynamic movement of the nozzle needles from bodies of the injector nozzle as time, speed, acceleration and dynamic force. The influence of the angular position of the needle in relation to the bodies of the precision pairs conventional internal combustion engines, the diametral clearance between the nozzle body and needle, and the surface conditions on the values of the maximum friction force are also presented. Errors in shape and position result in the uniqueness of the friction force at the mutual angular position of the needle in relation to the nozzle body, and the decrease in diametral clearance and deterioration of the surface state increase the friction losses. A model was elaborated of the influence of various factors on the value of the maximum friction force."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a047397297"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"6898","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a047397297"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632c56884097076d6d457221","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"19","documentHash":"e1d022ef-6512-483e-9abb-935273649c69"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["friction force","internal combustion engines","injection apparatus","precision pairs"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264866"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b81b0","name":"MAGDALENA","lastName":"ŚLĄCZKA-WILK","uuid":"7D9A170983C231B78496ECFA1224BA93BEB60672707487E575D018E1B74CB90D22C6F01FE60FB6981EF92038EA990ABBC6448D42FFC17403F374FD94C6A0677B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5006-4147","documentHash":"f113495d-7193-40aa-a256-e21c6b595f66"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b81ae","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"KALBARCZYK-JEDYNAK","uuid":"25AC1644194D3C29AEB2D0A88B383C512A96F8BF9EC0CA7C0C1C43B96DA14628AB75EB50E1627C982D1A1969BDD0E9B5AE95A55CD2E32F3899F2D6BC26FFE6CB","orcidId":"0000-0001-7513-4837","documentHash":"82d9c156-2ea0-41a5-bcd2-bf6a1919803b"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a489","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kaup","uuid":"C7F6842B24AE7D851F746BB317ABD52367EC9B1CC6B9DC784405E574DA9ED7375446845C4B5D17E7606D6CCAAE8E648B9B63E7267FBFCF47422FA0035E2E2F7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9384-8144","documentHash":"488c8c4d-34b8-4f07-9c8f-5bbc32d1ed8a"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972eb","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"ŚLĄCZKA","uuid":"759D7BBB207B434EFA81A5CA6F08F7D206BED69E025A0F821F004076FA7A0CDD9783E41F2B94B43A5AE5CF41E1690AD8A01EDD81784FB6469F9F64AD37799A08","orcidId":"0000-0003-3265-9726","documentHash":"c3a0236f-a4c1-4ffe-8618-771c3f20fc03"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972a1","name":"DOROTA","lastName":"ŁOZOWICKA","uuid":"85EE5CFFF61AB9BE949BB56FF018079F02B7F53F552E7DF3554357916CA1B9241246E4C28186859FF3AE2E6B7BE02E100CD805210DA896BF70CB38E28CC6CC94","orcidId":"0000-0001-8031-762X","documentHash":"274988a9-acff-4f39-9d75-2dcf133e53d0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"629f27e340970718a385cd88","doi":"10.3390/en15114057","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/11/4057","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Assessment of Explosion Safety Status within the Area of an LNG Terminal in a Function of Selected Parameters","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper examines the issues of designing optimization tasks with the objective of ensuring the safety and continuation of transportation processes. Modelling the processes that are a consequence of a breakdown is a crucial issue enabling an increase of safety at selected stages of transport. This paper elaborates on the matter of modelling hazardous situations resulting from an uncontrolled LNG release due to a crash or damage to a ship’s hull. This paper demonstrates subsequent stages of modelling along with theoretical assumptions and finally it presents the results of simulation calculations for various scenarios of LNG releases. The article shows the complexity of modelling at a time when variable atmospheric conditions occur, which hinder the planning of rescue operations in the event of an uncontrolled LNG release into the atmosphere. It needs to be remembered that making decisions in critical situations and developing proper procedures at a time when people’s lives are at risk or in the face of an environmental pollution incident constitutes one of the most significant components of effective management in transport. Two LNG release scenarios are presented in this article: catastrophic rupture and leak, for which danger zone dimensions were calculated. Simulations were conducted with the use of a tool called Phast ver. 8.23 for LNG. Calculations were made in a function of variable weather conditions and for two values of Pasquill coefficients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972a1","5e709434878c28a0473b81b0","5e709434878c28a0473b81ae","5e709285878c28a0473972eb","5e7092ab878c28a04739a489"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"4057","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709434878c28a0473b81ae","5e709434878c28a0473b81b0","5e7092ab878c28a04739a489","5e709285878c28a0473972eb","5e709285878c28a0473972a1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"628e8bcc40970776244ff94c","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"11","documentHash":"b0a985af-2c64-4798-9de3-8fac95360440"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["LNG","safety","modelling of substance distribution","catastrophic rupture","leak"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058268380"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739724a","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"BIELAWSKI","uuid":"1E6BDD46AC0FF7FA199D2AD4E9ADBEB9DBC91937DAFFB434A3C8FC0CF85E36E2DCB4E680D0D7C404AB05F25B4B9FFCD2247FA4C80F2A342640146D223CFD16C5","orcidId":"0000-0001-9103-5740","documentHash":"56727ae2-f3c4-444b-a649-cc07627f95d0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"629f23e340970718a3857a79","doi":"10.3390/app12115660","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/app12115660","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Diagnosing the Machine Set Rotor Using Its Relative Vibrations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The efficiency and dependability of machine set depends on the quality of maintenance of functional units of the machine set rotor.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Research experiments verifying the drift movement trajectory under various hydrometeorological conditions were carried out in the Szczecin Lagoon. In the presented analysis, 17 fragments from ten drift trajectories were selected, in which there was a clear time shift in the influence of the wind direction on the change of the drifting direction. Statistical analysis of directional and linear data allowed us to link the directions and speeds of drifters moving with the wind parameters recorded in two places, Świnoujście and Trzebież, with an appropriate time shift. Findings: As a result of the research, it was found that the change of the wind direction influences the direction change of the flow of surface waters in the Szczecinski Lagoon with an unavoidable delay. A significant correlation was found between the speed of changes in the wind direction and the initial wind direction. A relationship was also shown between the distance of the test site from the weather station and the registered wind direction change. Originality/value: The presented relationships between some fundamental processes in the energy transfer between wind and water surface may be beneficial for the maritime administration, which is responsible for the safety of navigation in the studied water area. The analysis results can be used in SAR actions and to project the track of water pollutants."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972a6","5e7094f6878c28a0473c80dd","5e709284878c28a047397221"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"XXV","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"483-499","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397221","5e709285878c28a0473972a6","5e7094f6878c28a0473c80dd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dc39","mniswId":"22361","title":"European Research Studies Journal","issn":"1108-2976","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e13ec1b4-9fe9-4c4d-9da5-bd3082096ed5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"636b9cd9409707100109fba1","year":"2022","volume":"XXV","number":"3","documentHash":"469c0ecc-4a58-4838-bfcd-2ef48265b5e0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SAR","wind parameters modelling","wind parameters and forecasting","shipwreck drift modeling","directional correlation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058298191"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ff878c28a0473a0b6c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Piątkowski","uuid":"8D42C0386915CA7DFF4FAE4FD5592D742606C20361CAD3E4E09D76107E47387D0F14C8828503699E6B1690803A5B9F102C8F5EC22CAA57B7A4AE2C34E571E0F0","orcidId":"0000-0003-0734-5530","documentHash":"dcbb0781-d11f-42da-becf-7e61ebe5398a"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ad","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Michalska-Pożoga","uuid":"19ED15396DFB6C98CDE5CBCE61DFE034C6536F15A642BD5B87960E9CE3D1FE3A2ECAA7D978C722BD781EBF7C0BF2401E1F103B890E2B1A7499A80F2F1759A61C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6119-568X","documentHash":"77ad1eef-9bca-43a2-a899-bc5b0cb66274"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63777f6a40970701fd407119","doi":"10.3390/en15228606","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/22/8606","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Fuel Cells in Road Vehicles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Issues related to the reduction of the environmental impact of means of road transport by the use of electric motors powered by Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells are presented in this article. The overall functional characteristics of electric vehicles are presented, as well as the essence of the operation of a fuel cell. On the basis of analyzing the energy conversion process, significant advantages of electric drive are demonstrated, especially in vehicles for urban and suburban applications. Moreover, the analyzed literature indicated problems of controlling and maintaining fuel cell power caused by its highest dynamic and possible efficiency. This control was related to the variable load conditions of the fuel cell vehicle (FCV) engine. The relationship with the conventional dependencies in the field of vehicle dynamics is demonstrated. The final part of the study is related to the historical outline and examples of already operating fuel cell systems using hydrogen as an energy source for energy conversion to power propulsion vehicle’s engines. In conclusion, the necessity to conduct research in the field of methods for controlling the power of fuel cells that enable their effective adaptation to the temporary load resulting from the conditions of vehicle motion is indicated."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ff878c28a0473a0b6c","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ad"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"8606","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ff878c28a0473a0b6c","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ad","5e709285878c28a0473972c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"636b69e1409707100105d629","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"22","documentHash":"975aa9b7-cecc-45cf-914c-6c88cd24d471"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hydrogen","supply with hydrogen","alternative supply sources","PEM fuel cell","FCV"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313383"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70941f878c28a0473b69c2","name":"Adriana","lastName":"BOHDAN","uuid":"B6E2529D4F06A40C0C13E8DC3DA1C4BD50351FA85B3AAF8915EE02E5E81FFE85C2D63872579D0C4096EA2BBD369FC5493EB4B7D3464561CA7558773AB5157B92","orcidId":"0000-0003-2695-0808","documentHash":"3fa5398d-b088-4ce5-bc86-956d4d9590ff"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63875ec840970727ca81f279","publicUri":"https://repository.am.szczecin.pl/handle/123456789/2728","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Green port impact of the development of the sustainability in port cities","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Seaports and cities are internally linked, and the port can have a strong influence on the city, especially in the environmental aspect.

the distribution chain of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Poland, using the terminal in Świnoujście as the “source of LNG”. The focus is primarily on the possibility of LNG distribution for road transport, taking into account the effective use of its energy potential. During the transport and storage of LNG it was found that the evaporation of LNG, the so-called boil-off gas (BOG), is a significant problem that leads to an increased pressure in the tank. Therefore, the possibility of using BOG in individual links of the LNG supply chain is indicated. One prospect is its compression to high pressure, which produces compressed natural gas (CNG) fuels. Thus, this paper specifies the influence of the initial BOG gas pressure on the unit compression work and analyses the change in the compression unit work, which depends on the final CNG fuel pressure, with a specific assumption for the BOG pressure."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972eb","5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f93"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"71","issue":"143","pagesFromTo":"22-30","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f93","5e709285878c28a0473972eb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a6e6","mniswId":"18270","title":"Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii Morskiej w Szczecinie","issn":"1733-8670","eissn":"2392-0378","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"55da4823-47c1-4d4c-8247-e482fb4c9f61"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e7897940970778ffa6d0ce","year":"2022","volume":"71","number":"143","documentHash":"f417f9cd-0dba-477d-ac4d-613136dc362a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fuel","LNG","road transport","minimization of energy losses"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058318239"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a489","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kaup","uuid":"C7F6842B24AE7D851F746BB317ABD52367EC9B1CC6B9DC784405E574DA9ED7375446845C4B5D17E7606D6CCAAE8E648B9B63E7267FBFCF47422FA0035E2E2F7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9384-8144","documentHash":"488c8c4d-34b8-4f07-9c8f-5bbc32d1ed8a"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972eb","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"ŚLĄCZKA","uuid":"759D7BBB207B434EFA81A5CA6F08F7D206BED69E025A0F821F004076FA7A0CDD9783E41F2B94B43A5AE5CF41E1690AD8A01EDD81784FB6469F9F64AD37799A08","orcidId":"0000-0003-3265-9726","documentHash":"c3a0236f-a4c1-4ffe-8618-771c3f20fc03"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972a1","name":"DOROTA","lastName":"ŁOZOWICKA","uuid":"85EE5CFFF61AB9BE949BB56FF018079F02B7F53F552E7DF3554357916CA1B9241246E4C28186859FF3AE2E6B7BE02E100CD805210DA896BF70CB38E28CC6CC94","orcidId":"0000-0001-8031-762X","documentHash":"274988a9-acff-4f39-9d75-2dcf133e53d0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62d92fc140970776cd0bf849","doi":"10.35808/ersj/2894","publicUri":"https://www.ersj.eu/journal/2894","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Dimensions οf Inland Ships in Relation to the Parameters of Waterways: The Case of Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: The article focuses on the analysis of the relation between the guaranteed parameters of the waterway and the dimensions of the inland ships. This article focuses on the consideration of how the change of the allowable ship draft affects the value of the efficiency index. Design/methodology/approach: In this way, it was obtained that the transport efficiency is linearly dependent on the draft of the vessel, so if, despite the possibility of loading the vessel into allowable draft, it is impossible due to the parameters of the waterways, the overall transport efficiency may decrease to a greater extent. Changes in load capacity is another factor influencing the effectiveness of the use of inland ships in the conditions of their operation on Polish inland waterways.

For this purpose, polymer biocomposites were produced with a polylactic acid structure and reinforced in the form of halloysite nanoparticles by 1; 2.5; and 5% by mass. A new method of decomposition of the produced biocomposites was developed. For this purpose, the composting process uses complex sugars in the form of beet molasses. This action is based on Stevenson's theory of protein-sugar condensation. Thus, the validity of this theory was confirmed, as research showed that this modification significantly influences the acceleration of the composting process of the produced biomaterials. For each phase of the process, the parameters of accelerated composting were defined by determining the temperature, degree of humidity, and quantitative scale of acidity and alkalinity. The degree of decomposition of biocomposites was assessed based on microbiological tests, hardness, weight loss, viscosity-average molecular weight tests, and structure assessment using macro and microscopic examinations (SEM). Based on the microbial tests, it was shown that composting also seems to be an alternative method of infectious waste disposal in the case of using biocomposites for products, e.g., medical products."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f","5e70929f878c28a047399503","5e709284878c28a047397224","602f697d9543c7410626f451"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"183","pagesFromTo":"114974","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656e0a3c40970749a863eb61","5e70936c878c28a0473a92f5","656e0a3c40970749a863eb62","602f697d9543c7410626f451","656e0a3c40970749a863eb64","5e70936b878c28a0473a91b4","5e70929f878c28a047399503","5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f","5e709284878c28a047397224"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780a6","mniswId":"8251","title":"Industrial Crops and Products","issn":"0926-6690","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"69c928da-6f6d-4d08-a63f-877d0f71a92f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656f008e40970720e1fd20fd","year":"2022","volume":"183","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"96af879b-8800-4ab4-8358-3fd0e4fdbfa7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biocomposites","composites","halloysite","recycling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058321366"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092a2878c28a0473999b5","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Sowa","uuid":"B3D8FBBD9F5CFB4C3BB9A14A5A395F152085FF97B0C3C286CBF11CFC44EF4C5F3BD235A05DF6F1F954AD07240C5BAB3B8DBE523AA7C20E10640BCB565213D2F4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2820-8327","documentHash":"af98e191-6911-47a6-9979-fe9d4358f433"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972cc","name":"JOANNA","lastName":"TULEJA","uuid":"2AA3AD43EEBAA7DDF1173346CB6655F7716A4F158406CB662DB24F7C54313624A96D274739517B4CCA6B239E4716DF032D459972D330463FD1F689C5125B39AF","orcidId":"0000-0003-4877-725X","documentHash":"daee5c32-3bb4-4389-a5ce-5d741a803d39"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739720e","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"KĘDZIERSKA","uuid":"3A94C6F456F7CDC3C636157D03742704B3BF4937DDE20F4A5633F6406F8BE317F5A0FFD861587C46179CA8DE65E41AD93FA060AE40FD8E19A0232CF3F5297C32","orcidId":"0000-0001-6531-6231","documentHash":"2f7d5851-8453-492e-8679-4c0c81981ce5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-10-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"638b1af740970757e46f1120","doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2022.09.455","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050922013485?via%3Dihub","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The use of the finite element method to locate the places of damage occurrence in elements of technological equipment in carburizing furnaces","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the article, the stresses occurring in the basic pallet used as a carrier for elements subjected to the carburizing process were determined by the finite element method in the Ansys program. The calculations were performed for two models of the pallet. The first model includes a pallet that is free to deform during heating and cooling. In the second model, part of the pallet was covered with insulating material in order to force its uneven heating, which corresponds to the actual operating conditions. It has been shown that in both model cases the stress state is favourable for the formation of cracks. Based on the inspection of the basic pallets withdrawn from use, it was confirmed that the adopted numerical calculation method for a pallet with insulation was sufficient to locate the places where damage occurred at the element design stage. The conducted research is an introduction to further work on the influence of macro-stresses on the destruction of charge carriers used in heat treatment furnaces. At the next stage, a design solution will be proposed that will reduce the susceptibility to cracking at the corners of the basic pallet. An analysis of the stress state in the pallet covered with the charge during heating and cooling will be performed in order to indicate the stage of the thermal cycle responsible for the cracking of the charge carriers on a macro scale."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f8f5","uid":"bQmdkdjc2fEVOfEB4Ahn06Q","uuid":"224d312f-19b7-4f25-83ea-6ac59c6c2892","name":"Instytut Zarządzania","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a2878c28a0473999b5"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972cc","5e709284878c28a04739720e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"3931-3937","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574195a","mniswId":"1113","fullName":"International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems","shortName":"KES","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"bb65bc19-2aab-4b61-9a0e-d6b41e5b1e74"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"63ea0e3d4097076b4a83dd2d","startDate":"2022-09-07","endDate":"2022-09-09","fullName":"26th International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems (KES 2022)","shortName":"26th KES 2022","city":"VERONA","country":"IT","website":"http://cidn.ajp.edu.pl/conferences/details/conference/26th-international-conference-on-knowledge-based-and-intelligent-information-&-engineering-systems-(kes-2022)","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"4587a287-d921-4b4e-a765-81805d9cb834"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972cc","5e709284878c28a04739720e","5e7092a2878c28a0473999b5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e710e5046e0fb0001bb6a1d","title":"Procedia Computer Science","issn":"1877-0509","documentHash":"dbe5d51e-2d97-4014-bfa6-9c68f019e6cb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"634fc5c340970779e45ede38","year":"2022","volume":"207","documentHash":"143169aa-50c5-47ec-8c88-a2f7c5fd3a70"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["metoda elementów skończonych","szok termiczny","naprężenia","pęknięcia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["finite element method","thermal shock","macrostresses","cracks"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058321400"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65378994409707139649741c","name":"Ryczyński","lastName":"Jacek","documentHash":"4d28a525-7026-4e4f-9215-83a537763905"},{"objectId":"5e709435878c28a0473b834d","name":"EMILIA","lastName":"SKUPIEŃ","uuid":"97D9D9D551DE2300CD5A9E9AF61CE66EDF95C5AE6A3305299742258B164396894B6B31A9623CFB9034CFFA43F7C9886A9CBBD37F81D8E2EE6701831D332D1471","orcidId":"0000-0002-9903-8791","documentHash":"50607053-d3ab-45a6-9034-c2e520df480e"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397210","name":"STEFAN","lastName":"JANKOWSKI","uuid":"4C80C697C0E1D562C49D752D2D91A2AC383B17B11AD3502E9BBAB812A84C469CDD42E6B8D4DC03D15539820C6DB7ED9A01FD35C45D9D1F127563569C3F5664D9","orcidId":"0000-0001-9020-7950","documentHash":"0f6eb334-e789-4776-9209-9c0102cafb7a"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395d08","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Tubis","uuid":"C52B6DC81EB0884964F0F7ACF4DBB06B7FA8E2697838512926810D8DBD675BB224D5D7760511489C77B0B42B7EEEAD67CA2368C8891387F7C0EBAF67617DC82C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2993-036X","documentHash":"185c6385-60c7-43d0-aca5-3f024463ccc0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62da48e840970752a1efc559","doi":"10.3390/en15082750","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/8/2750","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Risk assessment of human factors of logistic handling of deliveries at an LNG terminal","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"There has been growing interest in fuel supply chains regarding transport safety and LNG reloading. This is due to the increasing consumption of this gas in the economy to create sustainable transport systems. Poland is in the phase of energy transformation, which increases the demand for this type of alternative fuel. For this reason, the number of logistic operations carried out by Polish sea terminals handling LNG deliveries is increasing. This article aims to present a method for assessing the risk of adverse events occurring during the logistic handling of LNG deliveries at a port terminal and its implementation for a selected LNG terminal in Poland. Fuzzy logic methodology was used to assess the risk due to the lack of access to specific historical data on identified events. The conducted analysis considers the guidelines applicable at the LNG terminal, described in the Terminal Operation Manual, and the specific reloading conditions occurring in the tested Polish gas terminal. Based on the analysis conducted in cooperation with experts, scenarios of possible adverse events were identified and subjected to a risk assessment. Based on the conducted analysis, those events were distinguished and their risk of occurrence."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","uid":"bX41kHc85ivocrWE0ISfROw","uuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","name":"Politechnika Wrocławska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709435878c28a0473b834d","5e709273878c28a047395d08"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","parentUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","rootUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397210"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"2750","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709273878c28a047395d08","5e709435878c28a0473b834d","5e709284878c28a047397210","65378994409707139649741c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6253e8d62467f02e69a1ed72","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"8","documentHash":"fefc1c04-33d9-4512-9038-a476e44034d9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["LNG","risk assessment","logistic handling","sea terminal"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058321649"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094f6878c28a0473c80dd","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"KAPUŚCIŃSKI","uuid":"B32A32EADED44FEDCDE83CB202DDC51CD069C84844AE23EF6DF541A20AEBD2EED5FE67C86D060E91B457A8B334EF62880827D3CAF32962966DD4C8532F0A6690","orcidId":"0000-0002-7680-0608","documentHash":"bcd71568-83b9-4276-ac1b-70a91ad2e353"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972a6","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"PLESKACZ","uuid":"0971E162AFD0D01CA79627518C6DEED1E18F3837C64BDD64509B8F4B4D68EC0C49CDE1CD46CB0AD91F70600069406E5B2EA6E29FE06A35EFC825B2718EC15DF4","orcidId":"0000-0002-4296-1243","documentHash":"da54ba49-8fac-4a17-a334-9c95ac32d6a2"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397221","name":"LECH","lastName":"KASYK","uuid":"D4E1AF8525D000E24B40B4327B84B26C11B14FC0AE51B25E3CA6EF897DDA00563B6EEF017851659581ED3236C3C714C1EC058722F2826FE1445EA173E424F98D","orcidId":"0000-0002-4719-0695","documentHash":"1b83e982-6aee-4f77-a509-03ac43d88035"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62da5c4740970752a1f04947","publicUri":"http://repository.scientific-journals.eu/handle/123456789/2716","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Comparative analysis of meteorological conditions on the shores of Szczecin Lagoon","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The definition of dynamic areas of searching for shipwrecks, and/or the movement of pollution across waters of Szczecin Lagoon first requires the knowledge and specification of hydro-meteorological conditions across the area.

Castings are made of AlSi7 aluminium alloy (silumin) in a plaster mould. A new type of polymer waxes enriched with bentonite was used to obtain new composites, minimizing the defects caused by the casting production process. The castings were made in the centrifugal casting process. The prepared plaster moulds were removed from the furnace and poured with liquid aluminium alloy (AlSi7) at 750°C. The surface and fracture of the castings was analysed using an optical digital microscope type VHX-7000 manufactured by KEYENCE. It has been proven that the studied castings feature surface defects (raw surface defects) in the form of high roughness and the presence of bentonite inclusions classified as casting contamination.

It fills the gap in the literature researching the changing communication behavior of the inhabitants of a given city. The main purpose of this article is to identify and analyze the preferred means of movement for inhabitants of a medium-sized city in Central and Eastern Europe. The research area was the city of Szczecin, Poland. The research was carried out using the following research methods: literature review, analysis of legal acts and documents, case study. The research material was collected using an anonymous questionnaire based on a proprietary survey made available to the inhabitants of the largest city of north-western Poland, Szczecin, in the GOOGLE browser in the period 17 May 2019–1 April 2021. The multiple-response contingency tables, chi-square test of independence and non-parametric U Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used for study development. The conducted scientific research showed that, when determining the relationship between the method and the destination, the respondents most often chose a car or on-foot commuting in all of the surveyed destinations. The research results increase the level of knowledge regarding residents’ needs in terms of urban mobility and the development of Szczecin’s transport system. They can be used in the rational actions of local authorities aiming to improve residents’ the quality of life in the context of the sustainable development of city transport."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c6","5e709284878c28a047397221"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"15","pagesFromTo":"5692","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972c6","5e709284878c28a047397221"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e104ad40970720e718196b","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"15","documentHash":"9b409fd9-b0fd-4c50-96e8-fb39f3e79a07"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable development","urban mobility","preferences in individual and collective urban transport"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058328395"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62f35ac4409707058d19eb05","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Wiaterek","documentHash":"ffcf77cc-6932-4333-8ca2-0c148b2655a6"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"}],"objectId":"62f35ac4409707058d19eb04","publicUri":"https://repository.am.szczecin.pl/handle/123456789/2720","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Assessing the topicality of the problem related to the explosion of crankcases in marine main propulsion engines (1972–2018)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a query aimed at assessing the validity of the topic of crankcase explosions prevention in the main marine engines. The study takes into account the engine type, engine manufacturer, ship’s age, accident severity, ship’s location at the time of the incident, and the share of fatal accidents in the analyzed population of crankcase explosions. One of the primary hazards associated with offshore and deep-sea ship operations – and primarily ship power plants – are fires and explosions that result in accidents and incidents with an average frequency of 60 days. This paper discusses the actuality of crankcase explosion hazards in the main propulsion engines of various types of sea vessels. The assessment was made based on the results of a statistical analysis of historical data from 1972 to 2018. The methodology consisted of three stages: (1) a selection query to obtain the source data, (2) analysis of the obtained results (data separation, extraction of additional information, and statistical analysis), (3) synthesis of the obtained information, and drawing conclusions about the numerical indicators describing the statistical distribution of individual events for the given evaluation criteria. The analysis showed that the risk of crankcase explosions affects ships of all ages – both in crosshead (31%) and trunk piston engines (61%) – and that the number of serious incidents (67%) remained constant over the investigated period. Half of all incidents occurred on vessels younger than 15 years old. 58% of explosions took place in engines of the most popular prime movers manufacturers. The probability that a main engine crankcase explosion will result in injury or death is 17.34%."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"71","issue":"143","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62f35ac4409707058d19eb05","5e709284878c28a047397245"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a6e6","mniswId":"18270","title":"Scientific Journals of the Maritime University of Szczecin-Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii Morskiej w Szczecinie","issn":"1733-8670","eissn":"2392-0378","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fdb820fa-cedd-41fe-95cd-b3a078aeeee6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e7897940970778ffa6d0ce","year":"2022","volume":"71","number":"143","documentHash":"f417f9cd-0dba-477d-ac4d-613136dc362a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fire safety","main engine","marine diesel engine","crankcase explosion","human casualties","prime mover","crosshead engine"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058328644"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397218","name":"WŁODZIMIERZ","lastName":"KAMIŃSKI","uuid":"3C89D05FA1A576450883B66A4E45122DDB236186ADCA4781696C54A1AC1B02CE676C2AFACD0363B9D566DCD20F294C8E0E3DAD67039DB13FE148F25283DDF72D","documentHash":"c1236ffb-9e4c-407f-80ba-2cdefb4ebd32"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"6391c6ce40970764e07f93ff","doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2022.157.15","publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Kami%C5%84ski-Szczepanek-1.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Analysis of hot work procedures applied on board sea going vessels required by safety management system","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: reasons for writing the paper is to present, the optimal procedure to manage specific critical job as hot work on board sea going vessels.

All activities related to exploration of minerals in this area are beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and come under the provision of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and related regulations. The geological survey, which was the subject of the exploration, focused on the polymetallic nodule deposits. Other activities covered the tests of nodule processing, including alternative methods of metal extraction. This article describes the methodology of the bioleaching process and provides a summary of the initial results of the bioleaching test, applied to the samples of polymetallic nodules taken from the H22 exploration block of the IOM exploration area. The bioleaching efficiency under different pulp density conditions was studied. The enrichment of heterotrophic Mn-reducing microorganisms was prepared as the leaching medium. Bioleaching of the samples took place with different sample weights in order to determine the maximum possible extraction yield and the highest concentration of elements obtained in the leachate. During the bioleaching, the media were also exchanged to achieve maximum polymetallic nodule decomposition with regular addition of nutrients for heterotrophic Mn-reducing bacteria. The bioleaching efficiency of the polymetallic nodules increased to 100% (without Cu) when the pulp density was reduced to 0.1% (w/v). The discontinuous bioleaching and washing process recovered 55% Mn, 36% Ni, 15% Co, 27% Zn, and 38% Cu when the pulp density was increased to 10% (w/v). To achieve total Mn, Cu, Zn, Co, and Ni recovery from the polymetallic nodules, an intermittent bioleaching with about 25 changes of 60% of the medium was required when the pulp density was increased to 10% (w/v). Bioleaching has the potential to be used as an environmentally friendly alternative to other commonly used options for leaching and processing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a3fe"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1373","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6389dac940970711474da1d8","6389dac940970711474da1d9","6389dac940970711474da1da","6389dac940970711474da1db","5e7092ab878c28a04739a3fe"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478ea0","mniswId":"14412","title":"Minerals","issn":"2075-163X","eissn":"2075-163X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"2af82f59-2491-4ec3-9a2c-01d952e85824"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6389dac940970711474da1d7","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"11","documentHash":"9f736aca-63b5-43dc-a463-d76f8337cf58"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["polymetallic nodules","bioleaching","mineral processing","deep sea minerals"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058339437"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6661a0d94097074fa1bcc128","name":"Witold","lastName":"Maćków","documentHash":"f819b73f-4b2c-43e4-93c2-c34b696c9960"},{"objectId":"6661a0d94097074fa1bcc127","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Łysko","documentHash":"e6d1696f-ba7d-45eb-8a54-65180c433f92"},{"objectId":"6661a0d94097074fa1bcc126","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Forczmański","documentHash":"082e1852-058a-46c7-add0-656000dd03fb"},{"objectId":"619325b87523400e6371e262","name":"JAKUB","lastName":"ŚLEDZIOWSKI","uuid":"0394222B42D50F73F3622D6658F50E094F873C7350A4A1FE29F43ACEA7C18894E9872ACBA475ACD90ECFAB336132C5709D00208B3B90D637E5BEB457D336DC35","orcidId":"0000-0001-9359-7907","documentHash":"8eb5b671-b6f1-4a02-8f81-64185b6db819"},{"objectId":"5e7094df878c28a0473c5c20","name":"Apoloniusz","lastName":"Kurylczyk","uuid":"A618CE2EF26037D2FA0256837C32739CE286D222FC063B69025A57BD4F892E67ED9C6E2449A4FCF0E8A13CF11DA45978E97DC35E1E714985B7ACD4E9508C13AA","orcidId":"0000-0002-6378-0580","documentHash":"846fb445-b996-4153-861b-af4551a577c5"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a61d","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"TEREFENKO","uuid":"17666D8F8966BBD2E6848BA21E12A107E2E1552AD911508E7213B6B0F612ABFB55FAA5A62F0FA50C7452A55D9CED795FE2233A98FA8EFE52388E15F1379724AA","orcidId":"0000-0002-5081-8615","documentHash":"11e38919-d658-4abb-a14d-29b7eaccc64c"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a618","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"GIZA","uuid":"2FC83A0480F9C08D5AC5409D313583288BAAAD25408734CC8E4D9FFE053597072306ADCF787526121AB1A3BF495E4EF5BB133609A1BEF1F51AF80ACC21DDD6D6","orcidId":"0000-0002-5459-9261","documentHash":"ee0dde54-229c-4323-a731-56db79e78bcf"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a04739897e","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"STĘPIEŃ","uuid":"2DB2CE61E76FA8FA4C53CBC434774937F20E2F6F0EEDBDE295411733A41602A8A67D83D683ECC68473F9CF858E85226A3D62066AA70D1AADAFCD7F7B32277C3C","orcidId":"0000-0002-1080-6388","documentHash":"472f00dc-4d89-4fb1-bdb4-db6a71e68b0f"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972cd","name":"ARKADIUSZ","lastName":"TOMCZAK","uuid":"073A1937B996328768EB350854B9BB5EE6FEA84A23DC0057D8F64CFAF6F3BEA62184A10E0B2F10B37B010BE3C2B68489F9DC0A89D5F0B2D62F16C9E1230436E0","orcidId":"0000-0003-1275-2659","documentHash":"32b874ea-5670-4730-8538-e2ef102620bb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-19","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63925f8340970764e08abc5b","doi":"10.3390/rs14030458","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/3/458/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Application of unmanned aerial vehicles and image processing techniques in monitoring underwater coastal protection measures","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A prerequisite for solving issues associated with surf zone variability, which affect human activity in coastal zones, is an accurate estimation of the effects of coastal protection methods. Therefore, performing frequent monitoring activities, especially when applying new nature-friendly coastal defense methods, is a major challenge. In this manuscript, we propose a pipeline for performing low-cost monitoring using RGB images, accessed by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a four-level analysis architecture of an underwater object detection methodology. First, several color-based pre-processing activities were applied. Second, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization and the Hough transform methodology were used to automatically detect the underwater, circle-shaped elements of a hybrid coastal defense construction. An alternative pipeline was used to detect holes in the circle-shaped elements with an adaptive thresholding method; this pipeline was subsequently applied to the normalized images. Finally, the concatenation of the results from both the methods and the validation processes were performed. The results indicate that our automated monitoring tool works for RGB images captured by a low-cost consumer UAV. The experimental results showed that our pipeline achieved an average error of four pixels in the test set."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5f4afa68752340073806a89f","uid":"bqUy318c1k8dlOvXZTjDQxw","uuid":"2f040002-e1ef-49ce-b119-2c8ae9709b21","name":"Szkoła Doktorska Uniwersytetu Szczecińskiego","affiliatedPersonIDs":["619325b87523400e6371e262"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f902","uid":"bk_n03ydqnhCQzeW0cj586g","uuid":"dae78b8a-6bdd-4a4c-aeba-e3409b15c413","name":"Instytut Nauk o Morzu i Środowisku","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a618","5e7092ac878c28a04739a61d"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f8f6","uid":"bbiOKvMDIZKs9YekF98XAyw","uuid":"6890f8cc-a8a5-4bf1-a369-59f7884cfa5e","name":"Instytut Gospodarki Przestrzennej i Geografii Społeczno-Ekonomicznej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094df878c28a0473c5c20"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972cd","5e709297878c28a04739897e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-18","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["619325b87523400e6371e262","5e7092ac878c28a04739a61d","5e7092ac878c28a04739a618","6661a0d94097074fa1bcc126","6661a0d94097074fa1bcc127","6661a0d94097074fa1bcc128","5e709297878c28a04739897e","5e709285878c28a0473972cd","5e7094df878c28a0473c5c20"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","issn":"2072-4292","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"adfc571f-e92f-4da0-8504-22894916b3f6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6284e4c240970712d1b6cfc2","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"3","documentHash":"95491830-e5a1-43ec-b896-8554bf157685"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["monitoring wybrzeża","bezzałogowe statki powietrzne","przetwarzanie obrazu","detekcja obiektów","rafy podwodne"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["coastal monitoring","unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","image processing","object detection","underwater reef"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058339765"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7091f7878c28a04738dce2","name":"MARIUSZ","lastName":"JEDLIŃSKI","uuid":"FE32B4379F4773E30ECCC934EEA2804C18B4B44DEAEBD05D92C860F8892D31BDBE80849F1FE208F6477B416288F0721DBFBCA2A30204B8C7782352045374DED8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4227-2755","documentHash":"86c8be66-5730-457f-92fb-eae238ebca6c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6389d98040970711474d84f7","publicUri":"https://repository.am.szczecin.pl/handle/123456789/2736","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The hidden potential of advantages offered by a wooden pallet in a heterogeneous pallet pool – theoretical and analytical view","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A flat wooden pallet, being a simple logistics carrier in terms of its structure, can nonetheless be treated as a highly specialized logistical and marketing object applied in complex supply chains. Rigorous measures taken to standardize pallets are predominantly aimed at ensuring the highest possible safety level for the transported products and people handling the freight units during the complex logistical processes that involve pallets along supply chains. The goal of this article was to increase understanding of the operating strategies employed by entities using pallet pools, as well as the organizational, operational, and market challenges faced by them. It was hoped to achieve this goal via both theoretical and empirical studies. To this end, the research study applied theoretical synthesis and empirical evidence derived from primary research based on the industrial, transport, forwarding, and logistics markets. At the same time, the theoretical context was based on the literature on the subject, related to wooden pallet issues and their special role in logistical processes. Challenges connected with decisions made to enable effective and efficient management of pallet pools were addressed at legal and regulatory, as well as organizational and operational, levels. Diverse courses of action identified in several stakeholder groups were reflected in the adopted philosophy of managing the main feeding streams of pallet pools. Though limited to just the Polish market, the research study was sufficiently representative due to the strategic share of the European and global market of standard flat wooden pallets. The author proposes taking a perspective of value-added synergy as an alternative (to be understood as different and complementary rather than excluding possibilities) to other ways of approaching the value of supply chains. The undertaken considerations may contribute to increasing the awareness of the importance of taking a pallet, so common from the technical and technological point of view, as a value-added carrier in scientific considerations, due to its paradoxically low individual economic vulnerability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091f7878c28a04738dce2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"71","issue":"143","pagesFromTo":"111-119","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091f7878c28a04738dce2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a6e6","mniswId":"18270","title":"Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii Morskiej w Szczecinie","issn":"1733-8670","eissn":"2392-0378","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"55da4823-47c1-4d4c-8247-e482fb4c9f61"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e7897940970778ffa6d0ce","year":"2022","volume":"71","number":"143","documentHash":"f417f9cd-0dba-477d-ac4d-613136dc362a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["supply chain","logistics infrastructure","wood pallets pool","hidden value","logistics process"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058339908"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094dd878c28a0473c5a0f","name":"MATEUSZ","lastName":"LISAJ","uuid":"BEA2D10CA9A46A574DB70B6E1BCC9FEE27FDEF276A93C3E4E783E03A1944299E8667FF6E082D14863A3971215439128605D9BF561C45D4C25D6F26F3792D5028","orcidId":"0000-0001-6911-1663","documentHash":"b8746734-4912-4d01-8df6-69859ea63b4b"},{"objectId":"5e7092a7878c28a047399f6a","name":"ADAM","lastName":"BALCERZAK","uuid":"5721D93462C0A25851BB4001018DBA032631598B69ED10648C993256B46A28920A8F2807F67036B2DC4359ED2F6F4A126B8AFC647A7919A6E4B67B9FE3D6FE46","orcidId":"0000-0002-9047-4941","documentHash":"caef6556-79f7-45d2-8f75-fd52277c215c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"63925c9940970764e08aacfb","doi":"10.1140/epjc/s10052-022-10704-3","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1140/epjc/s10052-022-10704-3.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Decaying universes and the emergence of Bell-type interuniversal entanglement in varying fundamental constants cosmological model","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we consider a high-curvature limit of the varying fundamental constants toy model in which both the value of the speed of light and the value of the gravitational constant are related to the values of the two non-minimally coupled scalar fields. The high-curvature limit motivates the application of the third quantization procedure to such a toy model which results in a theory that describes bosonic massive particles that move freely in the three-dimensional minisuperspace associated with the degrees of freedom of the original model. Motivated by the idea that in the quantum cosmological description the minisuperspace gets promoted to a real configurational space of the system we supplement the third quantized action of the considered model with an interaction term that allows for decay and scattering processes. We show that such interaction term induces a scenario in which a parent universe decays into two universes described by a nearly maximally entangled Bell state. We eventually asses the strength of the entanglement, in the created pair of universes, by calculating the von Neumann entropy of entanglement."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f901","uid":"b6gUQbt4pHMAgmA8CPCfM6A","uuid":"c4de155a-292f-41b5-b74a-7ee5f8ef2f26","name":"Instytut Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a7878c28a047399f6a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094dd878c28a0473c5a0f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-8","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a7878c28a047399f6a","5e7094dd878c28a0473c5a0f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c12","mniswId":"6310","title":"European Physical Journal C","issn":"1434-6044","eissn":"1434-6052","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"25832d3d-9b7d-49f1-8af1-09d452843529"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"650839e240970739aadb6275","year":"2022","volume":"82","number":"8","documentHash":"5db43f55-2127-4751-83bd-a755bc440cf8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["splątanie","wieloświat","stany Bella"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["multiverse","entanglement","Bell states"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058339940"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6389ddff40970711474dc7df","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Fydrych","documentHash":"dd79213d-ef81-48dc-a27b-eb438ba9ff03"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739725a","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"ADAMKIEWICZ","uuid":"1F036D30836ED3E06F128ACB1A1E2F75CB303145BC360938CE025FD53327F743283BD86B9BFF79260371C02ECF84904F90A7058CC556BE624709DFBB072924A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8314-0660","documentHash":"5b667c21-74ae-41da-bc7b-4d7fdff3cf3f"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397244","name":"JAN","lastName":"DRZEWIENIECKI","uuid":"F8B7912FFC9D0D6640FC6A737769EA9162C4AC8BBAF8472A996A844550348BA557488C629C5462974A14EDB24300E55A7BA80A357A556442FE8BABB521BE50B9","orcidId":"0000-0001-8758-8131","documentHash":"5063154c-9fc1-47e2-8aeb-456a33963407"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-29","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":1,"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6389ddff40970711474dc7dd","doi":"10.2478/pomr-2022-0031","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/pomr-2022-0031","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Studies on the Effects of Cold Starts of the Ship Main Engine","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article presents the influence of various ship’s operational conditions occurring during manoeuvres related to entering and leaving the ports and mooring operations.

The effects of cold start-ups of the main ship engine are the subject of this study. Conditions of the engine inlet valve damage process are discussed. The physics of the degradation process leading to air inlet valve damage was considered. Laboratory tests of structure continuity and their results are discussed, and the valve material defects were excluded as the cause of the damage. The causes of repeated damage to the inlet air valves were identified. The effectiveness of the performed corrective measures was confirmed by a documented control test of the engine start-up.

At first, the nonlinear ship model of the Norrbin type is linearized with the use of simple system nonlinearity cancellation. Since the exact values of the model parameters are not known to overcome the resulting inaccuracies, these parameters are tuned in such a way as to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the system. Some novelty is that by treating the load disturbance as an additional, unknown parameter of the system, we do not need to introduce an extra integral action to deal with the appearing steady-state error. The simulations of the ship course change process confirmed the high efficiency of the proposed controller despite the assumed uncertainty of the system parameters and environmental disturbances. An important feature of this approach is also the elimination of the tuning problem."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972d6","5e709284878c28a04739722d","5e7092ac878c28a04739a5c5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"207","pagesFromTo":"936-945","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574195a","mniswId":"1113","fullName":"International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems","shortName":"KES","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"bb65bc19-2aab-4b61-9a0e-d6b41e5b1e74"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"638b16c540970757e46f003a","startDate":"2022-09-07","endDate":"2022-09-09","fullName":"26th International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems","shortName":"26th KES 2022","city":"Verona","country":"IT","website":"http://kes2022.kesinternational.org/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"e076f38c-615b-4241-b51a-55fb0f675525"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972d6","5e709284878c28a04739722d","5e7092ac878c28a04739a5c5","63908363409707120cc882f3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e710e5046e0fb0001bb6a1d","title":"Procedia Computer Science","issn":"1877-0509","documentHash":"dbe5d51e-2d97-4014-bfa6-9c68f019e6cb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"634fc5c340970779e45ede38","year":"2022","volume":"207","documentHash":"143169aa-50c5-47ec-8c88-a2f7c5fd3a70"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ADRC methodology","PID control","ship autopilot design","full-scale ship model"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058346823"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"615fad2875234017e0505d6f","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Baszak","uuid":"59BEE8C67DCA6D908CD74F3DC92CB88554FBBA90960DA31F0A4F0E90377C2CA68A114EA4F90C74DFAAC1CCE87074649CF6D081FBB555DF3121BD80112226BBAF","documentHash":"4b744189-7b54-41ca-a7ae-6a3774ab87f4"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b81ae","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"KALBARCZYK-JEDYNAK","uuid":"25AC1644194D3C29AEB2D0A88B383C512A96F8BF9EC0CA7C0C1C43B96DA14628AB75EB50E1627C982D1A1969BDD0E9B5AE95A55CD2E32F3899F2D6BC26FFE6CB","orcidId":"0000-0001-7513-4837","documentHash":"82d9c156-2ea0-41a5-bcd2-bf6a1919803b"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a489","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kaup","uuid":"C7F6842B24AE7D851F746BB317ABD52367EC9B1CC6B9DC784405E574DA9ED7375446845C4B5D17E7606D6CCAAE8E648B9B63E7267FBFCF47422FA0035E2E2F7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9384-8144","documentHash":"488c8c4d-34b8-4f07-9c8f-5bbc32d1ed8a"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972eb","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"ŚLĄCZKA","uuid":"759D7BBB207B434EFA81A5CA6F08F7D206BED69E025A0F821F004076FA7A0CDD9783E41F2B94B43A5AE5CF41E1690AD8A01EDD81784FB6469F9F64AD37799A08","orcidId":"0000-0003-3265-9726","documentHash":"c3a0236f-a4c1-4ffe-8618-771c3f20fc03"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972a1","name":"DOROTA","lastName":"ŁOZOWICKA","uuid":"85EE5CFFF61AB9BE949BB56FF018079F02B7F53F552E7DF3554357916CA1B9241246E4C28186859FF3AE2E6B7BE02E100CD805210DA896BF70CB38E28CC6CC94","orcidId":"0000-0001-8031-762X","documentHash":"274988a9-acff-4f39-9d75-2dcf133e53d0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6311b46e409707352b68b2d7","doi":"10.3390/app12168381","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/16/8381/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Risk Analysis of Seaport Construction Project Execution","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article concerns the assessment of the level of risk at the stage of construction of a seaport, with particular emphasis on selected adverse incidents that can significantly affect the timeliness of the investment.

This allowed the identification of incidents with the highest probability of occurrence during the port construction process and to determine their impact on environmental pollution and the timeliness and success of the investment. The risk analysis performed identified 15 typical incidents of technical nature. The determined risk level for these incidents is at a moderate level or lower, which can be considered acceptable. For all undesirable incidents the values of probability and loss levels have been averaged, because e.g., a fire can have an extremely different dimension and can cause a different scale of losses.

Obtained research data can be used to increase engines’ reliability, reduce operational costs of the vessels, and improve energy efficiency on board ships. Using analysis of under-piston scavenge drain oil, research has been performed to find the relationship between various engines’ operational factors and the wear intensity of cylinder liners and piston rings. Prediction models of the most suitable cylinder oil feed rates depend on the brand of cylinder oil and fuel actually in use, and the sulfur content in the fuel oil Verified in operation, the presented practical model can be used by engines’ operators to set up cylinder oil feed rates with satisfactory cylinder liner and piston ring wear rates and cylinder oil consumption. It is underlined that analysis of scavenge drain oil properties gives an answer whether reduction of the cylinder oil lubricating feed rate is possible, information about the quality of lubrication of cylinder liners and piston rings, and can be used as a maintenance tool to maintain the serviceability and reliability of marine slow-speed

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the decision to use solar energy and install photovoltaic panels in households in the years 2019-2021 within the area of a selected Polish municipality","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this article is to show the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on electricity consumption and, consequently, on decisions regarding the installation of photovoltaic panels using the example of a selected local authority in Poland—the Szemud Municipality. The analysis was conducted in 2022 and covered the years 2019–2021. An attempt was made to explore the factors that may have triggered an increase in the use of solar energy in households and identify the determinants of installing photovoltaic panels in the period under analysis. Previous analyses of the PV market (and the impact of the pandemic on it) have so far focused on the market as a whole, either in macro or global terms, while studies on smaller municipalities have been limited to examining changes in electricity consumption levels during the COVID-19 pandemic and during lockdown. Therefore, a research gap was identified in that there are no studies analyzing the reasons for the shift from conventional to PV-assisted energy in households, with the COVID-19 pandemic as the background of these changes. The literature research showed that there are currently no studies attempting to establish a link between the increased interest in this type of energy by local authorities and the COVID-19 pandemic. The research confirmed the hypothesis of increased interest in household PV during the pandemic. The main conclusions of the study boil down to the need for further support as well as promotion of the use of solar energy.

The sea waterway must be adjusted to the navigation of specific types of ships, characterized by length, breadth, draft and airdraft. The primary requirement for shipping in sea waterways is the safety of navigation. Each sea waterway has traffic restrictions for the ships using it. These restrictions are called conditions of sea waterway operation or conditions of ship operation in the sea waterway. Problem: There are a number of empirical, deterministic or probabilistic methods to determine the safe width of maneuvering areas on port waterways. The direct application of empirical methods to determine the conditions for the safe operation of ships on the complex waterway, such as the Świnoujście–Szczecin fairway, was impossible due to the complexity of the waterway and various restrictions on its individual parts. Method: The paper presents the assumptions and calculation procedure of a method allowing for the determination of maximum safe parameters of ships in existing complex waterways. Results: The proposed method was used in the preparation of port regulations for the dredged and widened Świnoujście–Szczecin waterway. The results of these calculations are presented as a practical application of the method. Conclusions: This article defines conditions for the safe operation of ships in complex port waterways systems and presents the methodology for determining maximum safe parameters of ships in existing complex port waterways systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709224878c28a047390892","5e709284878c28a047397233","5e709285878c28a04739729a","5e709284878c28a047397257"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"15","pagesFromTo":"7692","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397257","5e709224878c28a047390892","5e709284878c28a047397233","5e709285878c28a04739729a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences-Basel","issn":"2076-3417","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"01301afc-a0dc-4e98-8fba-0ab08483b798"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e7ab3c40970778ffa80933","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"15","doi":"","documentHash":"1280ebb3-110e-490c-bb89-4bf1a3a9f929"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["marine simulation","maritime transport","safety of navigation","maritime transport routes","design of waterways"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058471041"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6389e77c40970711474e4ff2","name":"Michael","lastName":"Bergmann","documentHash":"50d4792b-3246-4042-b71d-227c71545623"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972e6","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"ZALEWSKI","uuid":"AB61EA76077C0D21D709219272B4B32A3C91E00680E06B04A22B890CE18774A20503BB140DE6D28EB731B23634C32B81A62FDF8517C1D1032E5433F97C53D333","orcidId":"0000-0001-8157-9728","documentHash":"51a06cd9-7773-4733-bde1-d1414b74297d"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739724e","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"BĄK","uuid":"6DE64B34CE930B368CB6679EC2A53DE31345941E62D7288F10CE619C3A1F189E080E9B55385822B86C1D887BD440E2882815AA954B73F99CC6646011580AF076","orcidId":"0000-0003-4977-6304","documentHash":"ec2c235e-c59c-424d-a727-12857fcce281"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6389e77c40970711474e4ff1","doi":"10.3390/rs14215291","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/21/5291/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Evolution of Maritime GNSS and RNSS Performance Standards","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The primary means for electronic position fixing in use in contemporary maritime transport are shipborne GPS (Global Positioning System) receivers or DGPS (Differential GPS) receivers.

It is proposed that the initial boiling point be used as an indicator of the contamination of lubricating oil with distillate fuel (i.e., diesel biofuel oil) in the context of the rapid detection of explosion risks in the crankcase. Detailed tests were carried out on lubricating oil samples (SAE 30 and SAE 40 grades, which are most commonly used in the lubrication systems of marine trunk engines) diluted with diesel oil at selected mass concentrations (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100%). The oils were tested to determine their relevant properties: the flash point temperature and the initial boiling temperature. The flash point was determined in a closed crucible using the Pensky–Martens method, which is in accordance with PN-EN ISO 2719. The differences between the initial boiling point and the flash point of the tested lubricating oils were determined for different dilution levels of lubricating oil in diesel fuel. An approximate method for the calculation of the flash point of the oil based on the initial boiling point is proposed. The results of oil flash point measurements are compared with values calculated as a function of the boiling point for both lubricating oils tested. An evaluation of how well models fit the experimental results is reported. Conclusions are presented on the applicability of the proposed method during operational practice."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"21","pagesFromTo":"7927","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6358f7654097076d018c02b7","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"21","documentHash":"87ceda81-eb01-475b-becf-80aff228af37"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["marine diesel engine","trunk piston marine engine","initial boiling temperature","crankcase oil dilution"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058471224"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63907ed1409707120cc7eb17","name":"Michalina","lastName":"Gucma","documentHash":"080ad85f-4d1c-476b-b246-022167b95e06"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397212","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"DEJA","uuid":"47D7CB61583AFB91E88686194C6D7F6B5103105C86EFD98BF14E1E3F1AF0AF93AE62B8ABD6990345D6D8B7473247EE6F6BB81B69277CB6F3C2CB2FB25550B148","orcidId":"0000-0001-5988-788X","documentHash":"ccde8a10-eb07-4055-8225-d2d8aabcdf7b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63907ed1409707120cc7eb16","publicUri":"http://repository.scientific-journals.eu/handle/123456789/2722","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Assessment of selected remote sensing methods in detecting and tracking marine pollution","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper discusses the use of satellite tracking during an environmental disaster at sea, and it assesses the possibility of using remote sensing imagery captured by satellites using multispectral cameras and synthetic-aperture radar (SAR). This study is based on scientific literature and satellite tracking of the X-Press Pearl container ship disaster, which involved the EO-Browser platform. The purpose of this paper is to assess selected remote sensing methods for detecting and tracking marine pollution. The first part of the paper discusses satellite tracking of the X-Press Pearl disaster. The second part focuses on evaluation of the quality of remote sensing imagery from satellites and aircraft, when taking weather conditions into consideration. It should be noted that the research was conducted in real time when the incident occurred.

During the operation of such engines, the excessive wear of the cylinder liners and piston rings frequently occurs. The breakdown of cylinder liners or piston rings is very dangerous for the safety of a vessel, the environment, and the people on board. The reliability of engine components is an extremely important topic, as it influences the efficient operation of the vessel. Therefore, to prevent such undesired events, it is essential that the condition of the cylinder liners and piston rings is frequently assessed. This paper presents research that finds prediction models for the rate of piston ring wear. The compiled prediction models are verified using verification tests. The models can be implemented to evaluate the tendency of piston rings to wear, and can be used to evaluate the quality of cylinder liner lubrication. Our findings will help to obtain the required optimal piston ring wear rates, maintain the good operational condition of the engine, reduce the costs of engine maintenance, and reduce the total consumption of lubricating oil and the emission of noxious substances into the atmosphere. All the mentioned benefits are related to a reduction in the ship’s operational costs and are directly related to energy efficiency."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397218"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ad"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1433","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397218","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ce65864097076d267588ff","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"16","number":"3","documentHash":"1c39b60a-35c9-4885-96be-6cce0665242d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["piston ring wear rate","cylinder liner condition","cylinder oil feed rate","reliability","maintenance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058478170"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c5","name":"JANUSZ","lastName":"URIASZ","uuid":"A2B43AF3058F204B53C8FE375C2632AE5B007B392BA841AEB5CBE9C465764516D1A16C8EB8FF75FCEC683EC404FB3AEEAD52C57FD971E7FA811601999279CE1F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1915-1186","documentHash":"0b21fed2-4288-4228-a239-993f8017521f"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397216","name":"IZABELA","lastName":"BODUS-OLKOWSKA","uuid":"695DFA5F274060E776FA8B0D7D04A28F3AB48F092027C6123A3277F2134AC256F2E9660526299BD7DCE881F9512FB9F7E974063D2B84EC911C311E0BAA419FB3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4366-0116","documentHash":"2b1d3665-1483-40c2-99df-c8511769c8a0"}],"objectId":"63d8c5e040970739948bdeb1","doi":"10.36163/aon-2022-0003","publicUri":"https://annualofnavigation.pl/parametric-classification-of-ferromagnetic-bottom-objects-based-on-an-image-analysis-of-magnetic-anomaly-map/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Parametric classification of ferromagnetic bottom objects based on an image analysis of magnetic anomaly map","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The magnetic properties of ferromagnetic objects or naturally occurring minerals such as ores can be detected and mapped using magnetic field theory studies.

It is possible by detecting the magnetic anomalies they induce. The following article is presenting the stages of geoclassification of the bottom objects based on the analysis of a magnetic anomaly map. In order to determine the conditions and parameters of geoclassification, a catalog of ferrous seabed bottom features was previously developed. The catalog is dedicated to inland water areas and contains the characteristics of features potentially possible to meet in these waters along with the parameters of the magnetic anomaly they induce: e.g. spatial dimensions (length, width, area, perimeter, value ratio) together with the value of the generated anomaly itself. The further part of the article presents the map segmentation process, carried out for the purpose of detecting the areas covered by an anomaly and then dimensioning it along with the classification procedure.

On the basis of the conducted analysis we can say that a significant advantage of hydrogen vehicles is the total lack of emissions, a long range of up to 350-400 km and short charging times. However, a significant problem is insufficient infrastructure – not enough hydrogen stations. Despite this difficulty, more and more manufacturers are interested in producing hydrogen vehicles, and investors are seriously considering the costs and benefits of zero-emission buses.

The efficiency of processing such large and heterogeneous data is crucial for extracting the reliable and consistent information that is needed for the effective management of smart cities within the field of transport. Data heterogeneity and volume as well as its integration and analytics are big challenges for decision-makers. The development of urban agglomerations is largely dependent on the proper management of such data. Therefore, this paper explores the role of these data repositories, their acquisition from different sources, and the ways to combine them. The main goal of this paper is to propose a concept of Smart City management based on Big Data Analytics and technology related to UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) which may reduce costs and resource consumption. The presented concept includes successive data generation and collection, data type identification, problem and requirement identification, filtering, classification, pre-processing, and data optimization, as well as decision support analysis. A key part of this analysis utilizes computer algorithms, such as Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) and Thresholding and Blob detection, to develop a multi-camera image recognition system for freight transport management and logistics in smart cities. The objective is to design a system that optimizes the route planning and time of vehicle passage on selected road sections, ultimately leading to the reduction of emissions. During the study, data obtained from multiple sources were compared, and the analysis uncovered different results for the same assumptions. We discuss the reasons for these variances. Overall, the results obtained in the analysis indicated that it is necessary to correct the predictions of the multi-camera image recognition system with additional methods and algorithms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397260","5e709284878c28a04739721f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"9506","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a04739721f","5e709284878c28a047397260"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6396de06409707231272458f","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"24","documentHash":"ded6a837-c734-4996-a6be-874f26418052"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fleet management systems","freight transport","ITS","smart cities","UAV","big data analytics","heterogeneity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058501818"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094be878c28a0473c2f2f","name":"OLEKSANDRA","lastName":"OSYPCHUK","uuid":"C063F2C7D19BE0512F4FE02AC5B4AD163098AE1F16ABE71082A68B9ED776497D5809B591A8DE6D0E3F9AAD9EE498B8B78CB367B483A14D1BF4D6B9C11799F546","orcidId":"0000-0002-2712-245X","documentHash":"a85260b2-de07-45ad-bef8-15b0d725c9de"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397203","name":"STANISŁAW","lastName":"IWAN","uuid":"F493D83A4967CDDC3DD6CAC0D263937EF19134C3A98DCBADBC71C2176DAFAF818DD157A33208F63C12260CAEEC6848D8CE3E15014DDE047F7A199750A3B87CDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-5480-5475","documentHash":"3c8e640e-f90a-4332-a130-9623e9c950b3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63f733924097074c8dc40f6a","doi":"10.3390/su15043567","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/4/3567","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Analysis of Selected Solutions for Sustainable Urban Deliveries in the Construction Industry","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Modern cities are places where the ever-increasing human needs are met. This is possible through the creation of friendly living conditions and enabling economic exchange, as a result of which enterprises provide their clients with goods and services. Urban freight transport is an element that supports these processes. However, in addition to the benefits it delivers, its organization and impacts pose challenges in environmental, economic, and social terms. Implementation of construction projects is a determinant of the development of modern cities. However, this entails transport for supply purposes, which significantly affects the volume of freight transport in cities. Such a large share translates into a growing interest in the topic of using more sustainable ways of organizing and providing construction-related transport. The paper presents the first stage of research aimed at building a model for the implementation of good practices in the field of construction supplies. The aim of the paper was to analyze the transport of construction supplies in terms of compliance with the principles of sustainable development on the example of construction projects currently implemented in Szczecin. Furthermore, this paper is centered around collecting good practices in the field of construction transport. The goal was achieved using the analysis of the statistical data, non-structured observation, and surveys regarding construction projects being carried out in Szczecin, and also paper-and-pencil interviews with experts. It was possible to identify irregularities and gaps in knowledge in the field of sustainable urban freight transport for the implementation of construction supplies. The diagnosed current condition may be a significant source of problems in the future and clearly indicates the need for further research and action by both city authorities and enterprises in the direction of implementing measures for sustainable urban freight transport. As part of the paper, the possibility of using Petri nets in decision-making processes on the implementation of selected organizational solutions contributing to a more sustainable organization of construction supplies was also examined. The developed decision models were simulated in the HPSim software. Models created by the authors using Petri nets can be an important tool that clearly and transparently shows enterprises their possibilities in the implementation of good practices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094be878c28a0473c2f2f","5e709284878c28a047397203"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"3567","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094be878c28a0473c2f2f","5e709284878c28a047397203"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63e4a16a4097076b4a116027","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"15","number":"4","documentHash":"47c661a6-e8a2-40bc-bbb6-5eebca8a44b8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["city logistics","construction supplies","sustainable urban freight transport","construction logistics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058502385"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63e246c9409707409b814ee5","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Żółkiewski","documentHash":"36c47fc5-e54f-4204-9f53-71d37fd7231b"},{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b85d1","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"JAKUBOWSKI","uuid":"CCDC672652B5979C070593104E7F61E3F9DFB4D71AC214D176A3584072B4A5CF26B3BA1B614FB309DA57D91BF340D5403327EF2A25F782A86A8510EE2CCA9656","orcidId":"0000-0002-0331-3147","documentHash":"55041fe5-3c7d-4c5c-b2f1-627564d5ae6b"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63e246c9409707409b814ee3","doi":"10.3390/jmse11020360","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/11/2/360","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Analysis of the Relationship between Selected ship and Propulsion System Characteristics and the Risk of Main Engine Turbocharger Explosion","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The scientific aim of this paper is to analyse the topicality of the turbocharger explosions and to attempt to answer the question of whether some technical characteristics of the engine can be perceived as directly connected with the risk of the turbocharger explosion. Moreover, our objective was also to calculate the turbocharger explosion probability. This article presents the results of a quantitative and qualitative analysis of 42 explosions of marine main engine turbochargers occurring between 1977 and 2022. The number of explosions was analysed, and the average and instantaneous frequencies of turbocharger explosions each year were determined. An analysis was performed of the number of explosions with respect to the age and type of ship on which the accident occurred. An analysis of the contribution of different types of main engine to the studied population of explosions was also carried out. Criteria such as the number of strokes, engine speed, type of crank-piston mechanism, cylinder arrangement, engine power per cylinder, and number of cylinders were considered. An analysis was carried out of the disasters that had occurred, considering the contribution of the various engine manufacturers. An integrated distribution of the number of turbocharger explosions by year was presented, considering the engine speed, the maximum continuous rating of the engine, and the engine design. The analysis did not indicate a significant correlation between the type of ship and the number of explosions that occurred. More than half of the analysed population of explosions (median) occurred on vessels no older than 15 years. It is highly likely that engine type does not directly affect the number of turbocharger explosions and the risk of explosions. On the other hand, it is not possible to exclude the influence of the individual characteristics of an engine built to a particular manufacturer’s design on the magnitude of the risk of a turbocharger exploding during engine operation. Considering the number of ships worldwide, the probability of an explosion in a given year on a given ship is not less than 1.61 × 10−7."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709438878c28a0473b85d1","5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"360","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245","5e709438878c28a0473b85d1","63e246c9409707409b814ee5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c925","mniswId":"11734","title":"Journal of Marine Science and Engineering","doi":"10.3390/jmse","issn":"2077-1312","eissn":"2077-1312","documentHash":"6c46084a-9d2d-49a2-9b37-3f8bfcae78ad"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63e246c9409707409b814ee4","year":"2023","volume":"11","number":"2","documentHash":"65f0381c-b31f-49e7-ae7b-eb171c04c07b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["explosion","fire","main engine","turbochargers","Marine propulsion","failure analysis","prime mover"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058509312"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a047398792","name":"MARIUSZ","lastName":"NÜRNBERG","uuid":"611C6B9520888F4F9FC1C661F65AB65D9BE18FBB4B89C5A2A9764D7BAAE6EC3BE66E78812C7AB27D6AF28C775761C4941C784F823FE49156BC402164AD3D45B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4275-1350","documentHash":"96a5086f-ccf1-4d13-93c7-96f8c6fd95aa"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397260","name":"ARTUR","lastName":"KUJAWSKI","uuid":"8E5C2AF9CC9460951AB778606073C28414B5BAD06A2F7D3148A330977BC7A3296962AE2F8101EF94D39C708FC16FBB2AE6189580F1F20FDB2D872EC2AAC5B101","orcidId":"0000-0002-3661-1562","documentHash":"24263fe7-bb38-4d62-ad9b-2b44cb8a352e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63f74ca74097074c8dc7f559","doi":"10.3390/su15043285","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/4/3285","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Analysis of the Potential Use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Image Processing Methods to Support Road and Parking Space Management in Urban Transport","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Progressive urban density affects city centers especially and results in growing congestion, lack of parking spaces, and increasing environmental costs of transportation, causing increased air pollutant emissions and noise. These phenomena reduce the attractiveness of the city and result in a degradation of the quality of life for its residents. In light of these phenomena, there is a clear need for intelligent management of urban space using new technologies that would be complementary to existing intelligent transportation systems. Expanding information resources obtained from mobile cameras will have a positive impact on increasing the efficiency of transportation management and use of limited space in city centers. It will also have an impact on reducing external transport costs and increasing the quality of logistics services provided in the city. The main aim of the paper is to develop a concept of a transport management system in cities using mobile vision systems mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles. The model will concern the cases of lane occupation by freight vehicles and the analysis of parking spaces in the city in order to improve their management.

Numerous recurrent deep learning approaches, mainly based on long short-term memory (LSTM), are proposed for dealing with such problems, but the most accurate models may differ from one test case to another with respect to architecture and hyperparameters. In the current study, the use of an LSTM and a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is proposed for dealing with a data collection that, besides the time series values denoting the solar energy generation, also comprises corresponding information about the weather. The proposed research additionally endows the models with hyperparameter tuning by means of an enhanced version of a recently proposed metaheuristic, the reptile search algorithm (RSA). The output of the proposed tuned recurrent neural network models is compared to the ones of several other state-of-the-art metaheuristic optimization approaches that are applied for the same task, using the same experimental setup, and the obtained results indicate the proposed approach as the better alternative. Moreover, the best recurrent model achieved the best results with R2\n of 0.604, and a normalized MSE value of 0.014, which yields an improvement of around 13% over traditional machine learning models."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709302878c28a0473a105b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"266","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["642bf6184097077d14478afb","642bf6184097077d14478afc","642bf6184097077d14478afd","642bf6184097077d14478afe","5e709302878c28a0473a105b","642bf6184097077d14478aff","642bf6184097077d14478b00"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bb1c","mniswId":"2219","title":"Axioms","issn":"2075-1680","eissn":"2075-1680","documentHash":"a98458ed-88a8-44e5-a824-5ab915a2d338"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"642bf6184097077d14478afa","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"3","documentHash":"88ac164f-0af6-49a8-bdbe-0a8f76c1cfc6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["deep learning","metaheuristic optimizers","long short-term memory networks","solar energy generation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058560066"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e052497d","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"BROŻEK","uuid":"4635B57887278636145F7244DEB98B68F0D8FE6C5ADE495765BC130C7E90C26B200477CB06A9DD3CC11530816F9279B27C62568C179399FA5C4326B6AF52A668","orcidId":"0000-0002-5022-6492","documentHash":"520540ee-1ccc-4ca7-8403-81909f61e278"},{"objectId":"615fad2875234017e0505d6f","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Baszak","uuid":"59BEE8C67DCA6D908CD74F3DC92CB88554FBBA90960DA31F0A4F0E90377C2CA68A114EA4F90C74DFAAC1CCE87074649CF6D081FBB555DF3121BD80112226BBAF","documentHash":"4b744189-7b54-41ca-a7ae-6a3774ab87f4"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7e3c","name":"MAREK","lastName":"STAUDE","uuid":"C111C8CA6533B2647002880B562141DEAD14395B57FF3B9D09357EB6F74F323B319D535C3D658840D78D30D641C7E91996F8509C9F54EA19BC24910C56FAC6A4","orcidId":"0000-0002-6773-1962","documentHash":"d486f289-2eb5-4b88-a10a-b82fb14171a6"},{"objectId":"5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f93","name":"EWELINA","lastName":"ZŁOCZOWSKA","uuid":"18EB1AD75BF693447193D1EAFCA2FFFBF2B9B79268211F05110B1613F237AEFB256FE8BD75738419997C75C7C51CD8608929C51DF4307181DE845548ED52D801","orcidId":"0000-0003-0493-6562","documentHash":"27c0b135-65ae-47ac-a920-9e000be3ae8e"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a5c5","name":"MARIUSZ","lastName":"SOSNOWSKI","uuid":"33C8A79CA6ADA0BE371D67C6B3081749992C3CB63295837DE613CB22F20E333349BE22B6BD30DFBC851E65D0864282E99DCDC0C0578FB573B59855C2DCD20AF9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3260-6472","documentHash":"a0d26502-5b70-4b86-9761-e53a54d182db"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a047399503","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"BRYLL","uuid":"13D123B097AC3EB05B1642D9ABFD8FF54BF3FB711A1422A1D9C9A61508C1C306B42CA9AA50376A6C11E7722AFEE773DA2BBB111F589C91CFD5ADDB293A85B49B","orcidId":"0000-0002-2437-9356","documentHash":"8c36dae4-15c7-4c39-af4b-b8ecafad343a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63bbf04640970754861d9e2e","doi":"10.3390/en15249560","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/24/9560","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Study of the Combustion Process for Two Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) Streams Using Statistical Methods and Heat Recovery Simulation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study characterises materials that belong to the group of refuse-derived fuels (RDF). This group of materials regarded as an alternative fuel is derived from industrial, municipal solid and commercial wastes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of waste composition, demonstrate statistically different values and the energy efficiency of the fuel derived from waste. Data on incinerated waste were collected from two different sources. The basic physical and chemical parameters of waste include density and water content. The lower heating value (LHV) of waste, chlorine concentration and ash content of two groups of incinerated waste were also evaluated and compared for a given period of time (one year, with monthly breakdown). Statistical analysis indicated the differences in the combustion of waste groups, visualized by box plots and other diagrams to show the distribution of the results. An analysis of exhaust gas parameters was carried out, both in terms of chemical composition and energy parameters. The RDF combustion process was presented through simulations for the adopted conditions of heat recovery. It was found that for each kilogram of RDF, about 3.85 kWh (13860 kJ) of heat can be obtained. The combustion process was simulated using Aspen Plus software."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6164f32875234017e052497d","5e70929f878c28a047399503","5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f93","5e709431878c28a0473b7e3c","615fad2875234017e0505d6f","5e7092ac878c28a04739a5c5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"9560","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6164f32875234017e052497d","5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f93","5e709431878c28a0473b7e3c","615fad2875234017e0505d6f","5e7092ac878c28a04739a5c5","5e70929f878c28a047399503"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6396de06409707231272458f","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"24","documentHash":"ded6a837-c734-4996-a6be-874f26418052"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["combustion process","refuse-derived fuel","lower heating value"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058576871"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"642bf05e4097077d1446cd0b","name":"Selçuk","lastName":"Nas","documentHash":"9a1dce31-5908-4802-97fa-3e0e2be87047"},{"objectId":"642bf05e4097077d1446cd0a","name":"Burak","lastName":"Kundakçı","documentHash":"eb0645fc-e429-453e-a8eb-968d5a70e7dc"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397247","name":"LUCJAN","lastName":"GUCMA","uuid":"183EEB887094163A7D1DA32C6E1C9A50264C298AE5709B7EE006E0C53D5868B52A9B6808B26A98EF6B1D33C54FCD5C3431C76106942EAED5CF09441BFD7961ED","orcidId":"0000-0001-9706-3363","documentHash":"45e41b90-2c7b-43a2-81e2-283764211aeb"}],"objectId":"642bf05e4097077d1446cd08","doi":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2023.113921","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823003050?via%3Dihub","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Prediction of ship domain on coastal waters by using AIS data","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ship domain is crucial for collision risk assessments and may vary depending on the navigation area.

There is a significant trend of vessels being ordered with alternative fuel propulsion. Shipping’s future fuel market will be more diverse, reliant on multiple energy sources. One of very promising means to meet the decarbonisation requirements is to operate ships with sustainable electrical energy by integrating local renewables, shore connection systems and battery energy storage systems (BESS). With the increasing number of battery/hybrid propulsion vessels in operation and on order, this kind of vessel propulsion is becoming more common, especially in the segment of short range vessels. This paper presents review of recent studies of electrification or hybridisation, different aspects of using the marine BESS and classes of hybrid propulsion vessels. It also reviews several types of energy storage and battery management systems used for ships’ hybrid propulsion. The article describes different marine applications of BESS systems in relation to peak shaving, load levelling, spinning reserve and load response. The study also presents the very latest developments of hybrid/electric propulsion systems offered by leading maritime market manufacturers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ad"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f85479f085dcb410a25ed62"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1122","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f85479f085dcb410a25ed62","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ce65864097076d267588ff","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"16","number":"3","documentHash":"1c39b60a-35c9-4885-96be-6cce0665242d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["battery energy storage systems","ship hybrid/electric propulsion","ship propulsion electrification","electric ships"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058615886"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646b3540409707633df9d3a6","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Szymonowicz","documentHash":"ead29395-7cfe-4ee0-bef1-5df993915e35"},{"objectId":"646b3540409707633df9d3a5","name":"Michalina","lastName":"Gucma","documentHash":"361eafe4-333e-4dd5-a0bb-c88df6e28ea3"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397212","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"DEJA","uuid":"47D7CB61583AFB91E88686194C6D7F6B5103105C86EFD98BF14E1E3F1AF0AF93AE62B8ABD6990345D6D8B7473247EE6F6BB81B69277CB6F3C2CB2FB25550B148","orcidId":"0000-0001-5988-788X","documentHash":"ccde8a10-eb07-4055-8225-d2d8aabcdf7b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"646b3540409707633df9d3a3","doi":"10.30657/pea.2023.29.25","publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/pl/article/10.30657/pea.2023.29.25","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Environmental solutions for maritime ships: challenges and needs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The manuscript focuses on the subject of environmental solutions for maritime ships. With the increasing volume of cargo transported by sea, it is crucial to minimise its environmental impact. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has introduced new regulations in recent years to limit environmental damage. IMO’s initial strategy for reducing GHG emis-sions from ships aims to reduce GHG emissions from vessels by 50% by 2050 and CO2 emissions by 70% compared to 2008 (Resolution MEPC.304 (72), 2018). This has prompted ship owners to seek solutions to reduce fossil fuel consumption. The study aims to determine the feasibility of using eco-friendly solutions in maritime shipping to meet the challenges and needs of sustainable maritime fleet.

The prediction of energy load and consumption depends on various factors such as temperature, plugged load, etc. The machine learning and deep learning (DL) approaches developed in the last decade provide a very high level of accuracy for various types of applications, including time-series forecasting. Accordingly, the number of prediction models for this task is continuously growing. The current study does not only overview the most recent and relevant DL for energy supply and demand, but it also emphasizes the fact that not many recent methods use parameter tuning for enhancing the results. To fill the abovementioned gap, in the research conducted for the purpose of this manuscript, a canonical and straightforward long short-term memory (LSTM) DL model for electricity load is developed and tuned for multivariate time-series forecasting. One open dataset from Europe is used as a benchmark, and the performance of LSTM models for a one-step-ahead prediction is evaluated. Reported results can be used as a benchmark for hybrid LSTM-optimization approaches for multivariate energy time-series forecasting in power systems. The current work highlights that parameter tuning leads to better results when using metaheuristics for this purpose in all cases: while grid search achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9136, the metaheuristic that led to the worst result is still notably better with the corresponding score of 0.9515."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709302878c28a0473a105b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1434","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63da67f8409707687b07d36a","63da67f8409707687b07d36b","63da67f8409707687b07d36c","63da67f8409707687b07d36d","5e709302878c28a0473a105b","63da67f8409707687b07d36e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ce65864097076d267588ff","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"16","number":"3","documentHash":"1c39b60a-35c9-4885-96be-6cce0665242d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["deep learning","time series","metaheuristic optimizers","long short-term memory networks","energy load prediction"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058639977"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397208","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"CEPOWSKI","uuid":"6685DBCDB06D285734B9EE831FF17066B24A8506B542A758A1D1930D041F818B45526AC5B1636649DBDE6BA6DC454AD55550206670EA11E50A9B10009F858104","orcidId":"0000-0001-8038-075X","documentHash":"493be9f6-a180-4217-a1b3-b2fc1c0d0cb6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-12","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"646b2132409707633df8ca34","doi":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2023.114744","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801823011289?via%3Dihub","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The use of a set of artificial neural networks to predict added resistance in head waves at the parametric ship design stage","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"During the parametric ship design stage, added ship resistance, a component of total ship resistance is analysed to estimate the required propulsive power. The determination of added resistance at this design stage is problematic because the added resistance is calculated using hull shape, which is unknown at this stage. At the parametric design stage, only basic ship parameters, such as length, breadth, draught, block coefficient and Froude number are defined and known. Therefore, the focus of this research was to develop an effective tool to solve this problem. The article presents a set of five Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict added resistance using basic design parameters. Only model test data was used to train the ANNs in order to obtain reliable results. The research showed that using an ANN set consisting of five ANNs developed using different segregated data resulted in slightly more reliable and accurate estimates than using an individual ANN. To facilitate implementation, the developed ANNs were provided in the form of mathematical functions and open source software code from the Mendeley Data repository. A practical example of how an ANN set can be used to solve a design task was demonstrated in this article."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397208"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"281","pagesFromTo":"114744","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397208"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c2","mniswId":"15344","title":"Ocean Engineering","issn":"0029-8018","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"1769a8a1-e28e-487a-8470-bf6196654271"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646b2132409707633df8ca35","year":"2023","volume":"281","documentHash":"85716d7a-abf6-4c01-8494-a97f5ca78958"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Added","Resistance","Ship","ANN","Design","Preliminary"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058640350"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972eb","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"ŚLĄCZKA","uuid":"759D7BBB207B434EFA81A5CA6F08F7D206BED69E025A0F821F004076FA7A0CDD9783E41F2B94B43A5AE5CF41E1690AD8A01EDD81784FB6469F9F64AD37799A08","orcidId":"0000-0003-3265-9726","documentHash":"c3a0236f-a4c1-4ffe-8618-771c3f20fc03"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397257","name":"STANISŁAW","lastName":"GUCMA","uuid":"067D323C978A04E1738FD3BC990629D6DB66E1134907156F45ED7EBFF883954C1045402D167DB85E389F84A0A20BCA4DBEB482ECC97A5C0D2869B99BC8D61524","orcidId":"0000-0003-2286-8815","documentHash":"ea30d09e-fba1-4b99-93c5-db818862f72d"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739724e","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"BĄK","uuid":"6DE64B34CE930B368CB6679EC2A53DE31345941E62D7288F10CE619C3A1F189E080E9B55385822B86C1D887BD440E2882815AA954B73F99CC6646011580AF076","orcidId":"0000-0003-4977-6304","documentHash":"ec2c235e-c59c-424d-a727-12857fcce281"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"646cb688409707691c52b93f","doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0016.1230","publicUri":"http://www.archivesoftransport.com/eaot/2022/04/008.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Assessment of ship manoeuvring safety in waterway systems by relative navigational risk","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The safety of vessels navigating in the sea waterway system is ensured by fulfilling the acceptable restrictions called safe ship operation conditions in that system. The assessment of navigation safety is particularly important when the conditions for safe operation of ships in the waterway system are changed concerns increasing the maximum parameters of vessels, increasing the allowable hydrometeorological conditions or changing the minimum tug assistance. The article presents a method for assessing navigation safety when the conditions for the safe operation of vessels in the waterway system get changed. The method uses two indicators, which are difference in navigation risks and relative navigation risk. To determine the navigational risk, algorithms were developed for calculating the probability of accidents caused by the deterioration of navigation conditions and technical failure of ship equipment and tugs. Another algorithm was developed for calculating the consequences of the accidents that involve blocking a waterway by a ship anchoring in an emergency, grounding, impact of the ship against a port structure or moored ship and a collision with another ship in motion. The method developed for assessing navigation safety by means of relative navigation risk can be used in practice when changing the conditions for safe operation of vessels in the waterway system and when the system is modernized. Navigational safety management is a decision process that is implemented in the loop presented in the article. The acceptable risk is determined on the basis of vessel traffic intensity and ship parameters defined by safe operation conditions for a given waterway system. Relative navigational risk may be used in assessment and comparison of various conditions of safe ship operation. The probability of an accident caused by ship's moving outside the available navigable area due to technical failures of ship equipment or tugs is determined, depending on the type of port waterway and the manoeuvres performed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972eb","5e709284878c28a047397257","5e709284878c28a04739724e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"64","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"109-124","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397257","5e709284878c28a04739724e","5e709285878c28a0473972eb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479c48","mniswId":"21035","title":"Archives of Transport","issn":"0866-9546","eissn":"2300-8830","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"bf140c6d-8e2d-4c80-849a-7893ca734f50"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6389a92a40970711474af7f6","year":"2022","volume":"64","number":"4","documentHash":"1f468281-79bc-4d14-a511-8e913acdc35a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["navigational risk","sea waterway system","navigation safety on sea waterways"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058643650"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a04739729a","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"PRZYWARTY","uuid":"AF3736DE6F3EB70EC44DA9DD9788243A72254E26027995FBB294F2D1E6075CE6A09082C03F56AD6A9F5314B215431642C80A50385A7EE4232C0A09BA56C1B445","orcidId":"0000-0002-2438-7073","documentHash":"e932335c-40ed-4b06-b512-7035e758976d"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739725f","name":"JAROSŁAW","lastName":"ARTYSZUK","uuid":"E0B44859ABEC16F0BFCCA562095B64E5D20101AF343259445B87AF52CD23AC2047DDE6C346563544E84E3D3F7555F8B99B1137B1C8C6A3802A18F43EA3A9A447","orcidId":"0000-0002-9022-2672","documentHash":"43707609-7c1d-4fea-ab87-e506880025f0"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397257","name":"STANISŁAW","lastName":"GUCMA","uuid":"067D323C978A04E1738FD3BC990629D6DB66E1134907156F45ED7EBFF883954C1045402D167DB85E389F84A0A20BCA4DBEB482ECC97A5C0D2869B99BC8D61524","orcidId":"0000-0003-2286-8815","documentHash":"ea30d09e-fba1-4b99-93c5-db818862f72d"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397233","name":"RAFAŁ","lastName":"GRALAK","uuid":"675B730A73A3886C5465DAE098CBBE4D9DA6F3481C56156DF0E7B65F981B377319DDC6C482DF962851D52C717E87CE3DA1B36BB04715AC4A2E3459D2021FF542","orcidId":"0000-0003-0330-2197","documentHash":"b1e6f039-55fd-4a93-868c-721603c26f71"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"646de99a40970770404b8a8e","doi":"10.3390/app13020920","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/2/920","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Simulation Tests of the Passing Distance of Ships on a Two-Way Fairway","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"One of the components necessary to determine the width of a safe maneuvering area on two-way fairways is a safe passing distance.

The results obtained allowed the modification of the authors’ previous, but still widely used, deterministic–probabilistic MTE (Marine Traffic Engineering) method for determining the width of a safe maneuvering area."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397233","5e709285878c28a04739729a","5e709284878c28a047397257","5e709284878c28a04739725f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"920","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397257","5e709284878c28a04739725f","5e709284878c28a047397233","5e709285878c28a04739729a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"976d1e86-5dd0-4e19-9276-7114f4dea573"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"641aa5694097077035acbab5","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"13","documentHash":"f7c28e50-8146-4bb2-9407-f274cb1567e6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["maritime traffic engineering","passing distance","safety of navigation","safe maneuvering area","design of waterways","full-mission ship simulator","two-way fairway"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058646669"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"615fad2875234017e0505d6f","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Baszak","uuid":"59BEE8C67DCA6D908CD74F3DC92CB88554FBBA90960DA31F0A4F0E90377C2CA68A114EA4F90C74DFAAC1CCE87074649CF6D081FBB555DF3121BD80112226BBAF","documentHash":"4b744189-7b54-41ca-a7ae-6a3774ab87f4"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b81ae","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"KALBARCZYK-JEDYNAK","uuid":"25AC1644194D3C29AEB2D0A88B383C512A96F8BF9EC0CA7C0C1C43B96DA14628AB75EB50E1627C982D1A1969BDD0E9B5AE95A55CD2E32F3899F2D6BC26FFE6CB","orcidId":"0000-0001-7513-4837","documentHash":"82d9c156-2ea0-41a5-bcd2-bf6a1919803b"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a489","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kaup","uuid":"C7F6842B24AE7D851F746BB317ABD52367EC9B1CC6B9DC784405E574DA9ED7375446845C4B5D17E7606D6CCAAE8E648B9B63E7267FBFCF47422FA0035E2E2F7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9384-8144","documentHash":"488c8c4d-34b8-4f07-9c8f-5bbc32d1ed8a"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972eb","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"ŚLĄCZKA","uuid":"759D7BBB207B434EFA81A5CA6F08F7D206BED69E025A0F821F004076FA7A0CDD9783E41F2B94B43A5AE5CF41E1690AD8A01EDD81784FB6469F9F64AD37799A08","orcidId":"0000-0003-3265-9726","documentHash":"c3a0236f-a4c1-4ffe-8618-771c3f20fc03"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972a1","name":"DOROTA","lastName":"ŁOZOWICKA","uuid":"85EE5CFFF61AB9BE949BB56FF018079F02B7F53F552E7DF3554357916CA1B9241246E4C28186859FF3AE2E6B7BE02E100CD805210DA896BF70CB38E28CC6CC94","orcidId":"0000-0001-8031-762X","documentHash":"274988a9-acff-4f39-9d75-2dcf133e53d0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63f76c374097074c8dcaa8d0","doi":"10.2478/pomr-2022-0041","publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/pl/article/10.2478/pomr-2022-0041","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Review of the Container Ship Loading Model – Cause Analysis of Cargo Damage and/or Loss","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"As the maritime transport of containers continues to grow and container ships change in terms of design and construction, it is important to ensure the appropriate level of safety for this type of transport. Over the decades, the size and cargo capacity of container ships have been changing, and so have their manoeuvring restrictions and required stability criteria. It seems that changes in the regulations, technological development and increased stability requirements are not yielding satisfactory results – the causes of container ship accidents continue to show similar patterns. The present article refers to the problem of ensuring safety in sea container transport, with a particular focus on cargo processes. Its purpose is to determine cause-and-effect relations leading to the loss of containers at sea, and to develop a model of loading that could significantly raise the level of safety of container transport.The article provides a general description of threats to ships related to weather conditions, loading methods or stability limitations. A statistical analysis of the occurrence of damage and/or loss of cargo from container ships was carried out and the risk of cargo loss was assessed on the basis of data from 2015‒2019. A Pareto diagram was used for this purpose. The authors present the concept of the container ship loading model, which may contribute to increasing the safety of shipping in the future."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972a1","5e709285878c28a0473972eb","5e709434878c28a0473b81ae","5e7092ab878c28a04739a489","615fad2875234017e0505d6f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"26-35","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a489","5e709285878c28a0473972a1","615fad2875234017e0505d6f","5e709285878c28a0473972eb","5e709434878c28a0473b81ae"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479305","mniswId":"16308","title":"POLISH MARITIME RESEARCH","issn":"1233-2585","documentHash":"1b64f72d-b630-47d5-bf32-6fc50b3cb9ea"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63b53b1f4097076e47927d6d","year":"2022","volume":"29","number":"4","documentHash":"2219ee7d-ea9e-4b3a-a176-8b70ad7e39ce"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["container","maritime transport","safety management","operations process modelling","loss of cargo","means of transport"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058667182"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397272","name":"ALEKSANDRA","lastName":"ŁAPKO","uuid":"AFE1174BBB371C6ABD9C370F9797DA40368D7E7C34C5CF7FB3DFB719F331E631C4775DC6D3DC5332773B607803D17C71076EBCF7FAFF6B357EC51A2E03727811","orcidId":"0000-0003-0235-6329","documentHash":"0f57227e-e7bb-45d9-998f-f541d49c789a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63f7399c4097074c8dc50ee5","doi":"10.3390/su15043803","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/4/3803","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Age Simulation Suits in Education and Training of Staff for the Nautical Tourism Sector","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Education can be the first step towards sustainable tourism.

In the experiment, two Sakamoto suits were used that simulate a number of ailments characteristic of old age. The participants found the classes using the suits to be helpful in both their private lives and future careers, when they will face problems resulting from an aging society. After the experiment, the participants declared a greater understanding of the elderly and were able to identify more problems that senior tourists might encounter while visiting marinas. Therefore, in the future, they may make decisions to implement solutions that accommodate the needs of senior tourists in marinas.

This paper combines these effects and holistically analyzes the consequences of fuel in the lubricating oil of a trunk piston engine on the risk of crankcase explosion. The author hypothesized that diesel fuel as an oil contaminant increases the risk of an explosion in the crankcase of an engine due to the independent interaction of two factors: (1) changes in the oil’s combustible properties, and (2) deterioration of the lubrication conditions of the engine’s tribological nodes, such as main bearings, piston pins, or crank bearings. An experiment was performed to evaluate the rheological, ignition, and lubrication properties of two oils (SAE 30 and SAE 40) commonly used for the recirculation lubrication of marine trunk piston engines for different levels of diesel contamination. The hypothesis was partially confirmed, and the results show that contamination of the lubricating oil with diesel fuel in an amount of no more than 10% does not significantly affect the risk of explosion in the crankcase. However, diesel concentrations above 10% call for corrective action because the viscosity index, lubricity, coefficient of friction and oil film resistance change significantly. Deterioration of the tribological conditions of the engine bearings, as seen in the change in viscosity, viscosity index, and lubricity of the oil, causes an increase in bearing temperature and the possibility of hot spots leading to crankcase explosion."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"683","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bbf9d240970754861e7a00","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"2","documentHash":"bdcdd787-ec7d-42c3-b825-f07cfd910154"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["crankcase explosion","trunk type engine","flash point temperature"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058667325"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70943d878c28a0473b8ac1","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kruzel","uuid":"D091BD183AC156941A5DF5BAD6F23EE0ECFC246C19C039785FE63B56A7744338D7F2256585ADB0D98276BE4251A864375B6DAB4AD8DAA1C0658F5806E53AD52E","orcidId":"0000-0001-8349-1375","documentHash":"d452d99f-10be-4bbe-8fdf-3170cf572404"},{"objectId":"5e7093ee878c28a0473b3852","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Fiuk","uuid":"D2DB4B8633AADD6D840306E966C4A62B8270AA6F3B9F5A1614BA2D1F044F17E468C1A71379DB41AE8B36C648C3DF9C2A73F0DB82D40A152CB9BD4CD7729428B5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8069-9816","documentHash":"246bfba3-58e5-449d-a435-e2c0ddf144a1"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ad","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Michalska-Pożoga","uuid":"19ED15396DFB6C98CDE5CBCE61DFE034C6536F15A642BD5B87960E9CE3D1FE3A2ECAA7D978C722BD781EBF7C0BF2401E1F103B890E2B1A7499A80F2F1759A61C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6119-568X","documentHash":"77ad1eef-9bca-43a2-a899-bc5b0cb66274"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9a3","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Dutkowski","uuid":"AA6C5EEE9BF28E248AA3987F6B84BADD11B7EE2566C9BCF978C1C0EA061BB3F8E8A6E12B084EFABB40F63C62953E7FFD3D28EC3AF76121099BE86C592350DB98","orcidId":"0000-0003-3945-9882","documentHash":"3f150489-3dc2-4687-9b01-d2f241fe006b"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a996","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Rokosz","uuid":"1D4CE1A791735673B590920455AB77F410A403982459B4E1517B65C192613FFF40A2FBA04760AD959E1198517F42777FAF2B3502785DFF0009AE68BA96D3830D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1040-7213","documentHash":"9a205458-291e-420f-aa3d-24417373b3dc"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"646b2fdb409707633df971c3","doi":"10.3390/en16104125","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/10/4125","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Experimental Studies on the Influence of Spatial Orientation of a Passive Air Solar Collector on Its Efficiency","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The solar collector is used to convert solar energy into thermal energy. First, the internal energy of the absorber increases, which is reflected in the increase in its temperature. This energy is transferred to the working fluid in direct contact with the absorber. Depending on the type of fluid, liquid or air solar collectors are distinguished. When the flow of the working medium takes place naturally, without the support of pumps or fans, the solar collector is treated as a passive device. The gravitational movement of air in the inner space of an air solar collector depends on its construction and its spatial orientation in relation to both the source of radiation and the direction of the force of gravity. This paper describes the results of laboratory experimental tests of a prototype passive air solar collector, including: the influence of radiation intensity and the deflection of the solar collector from the vertical on the increase in the temperature of the air flowing through the collector, the mass flow rate of the air and the efficiency of the device. The tests were carried out using an air solar collector with the dimensions 2080 × 1040 × 180 (height × width × thickness) and radiation intensity in the range of I = 0 ÷ 550 W/m2. It was found that the vertical arrangement of the collector does not ensure maximum efficiency of the device."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a996","5e7093ee878c28a0473b3852","5e70943d878c28a0473b8ac1","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ad","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9a3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"4125","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a9a3","5e70943d878c28a0473b8ac1","5e7093ee878c28a0473b3852","5e7092ae878c28a04739a996","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ad","5e709285878c28a0473972c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646714e84097076e9cc00355","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"16","number":"10","documentHash":"eec1103f-1687-46e4-b835-a5f6544d735b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gravity","thermal efficiency","flat solar collector","experimental investigation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058694459"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63520429752340623bbf016f","name":"PATRYK","lastName":"BIERNACIK","uuid":"E4C339D9132BA5DB18E6DB7575F30A2CD0C8BF1A8406E2E4DC5FAA6CA22E4EB59A320630ABEE3C9BFE113BF83BA5A1A2A193B0E70E9EFAC91D2ECAEA21B930CC","orcidId":"0000-0003-4048-6992","documentHash":"558ab78b-e46a-4d5c-8fe4-7227ae86dea3"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c4","name":"MARTA","lastName":"WŁODARCZYK-SIELICKA","uuid":"E2672257D6548CB96A156323A538F169F850F21A9FCDF2CCE6C1D494DF5C18285AB32B3B9087F4704502FEE31B5D7C1D165D35505CD85ED9DCF844B04A45FD6D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7489-8437","documentHash":"e1658e70-952e-4244-bb79-494498fb1350"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739722e","name":"WITOLD","lastName":"KAZIMIERSKI","uuid":"6632CFA9746CAB3A5BCB8FAA5226A5D03854FBFC9C3D4FB66F7A1787AE16AC9DB2D875B4D5A78DCD80AC6AD8C71DE403C01243BC9A2B22B7CD9D57BADA475911","orcidId":"0000-0002-9637-0457","documentHash":"3799272c-706c-4890-abf9-092b1efabe89"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"646c97cc409707691c4fb0cf","doi":"10.3390/s23083941","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/8/3941","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Comparative Analysis of Selected Geostatistical Methods for Bottom Surface Modeling","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Digital bottom models are commonly used in many fields of human activity, such as navigation, harbor and offshore technologies, or environmental studies. In many cases, they are the basis for further analysis. They are prepared based on bathymetric measurements, which in many cases have the form of large datasets. Therefore, various interpolation methods are used for calculating these models. In this paper, we present the analysis in which we compared selected methods for bottom surface modeling with a particular focus on geostatistical methods. The aim was to compare five variants of Kriging and three deterministic methods. The research was performed with real data acquired with the use of an autonomous surface vehicle. The collected bathymetric data were reduced (from about 5 million points to about 500 points) and analyzed. A ranking approach was proposed to perform a complex and comprehensive analysis integrating typically used error statistics—mean absolute error, standard deviation and root mean square error. This approach allowed the inclusion of various views on methods of assessment while integrating various metrics and factors. The results show that geostatistical methods perform very well. The best results were achieved with the modifications of classical Kriging methods, which are disjunctive Kriging and empirical Bayesian Kriging. For these two methods, good statistics were calculated compared to other methods (for example, the mean absolute error for disjunctive Kriging was 0.23 m, while for universal Kriging and simple Kriging, it was 0.26 m and 0.25 m, respectively). However, it is worth mentioning that interpolation based on radial basis function in some cases is comparable to Kriging in its performance. The proposed ranking approach was proven to be useful and can be utilized in the future for choosing and comparing DBMs, mostly in mapping and analyzing seabed changes, for example in dredging operations. The research will be used during the implementation of the new multidimensional and multitemporal coastal zone monitoring system using autonomous, unmanned floating platforms. The prototype of this system is at the design stage and is expected to be implemented."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w

The CMFMCs are located in the residential area of a megapolis and include manufacturing and service enterprises, residential and non-residential buildings, and a city logistics node. Demand monitoring and identification of the influence of seasonal and social environmental factors on its fluctuations is considered as a tool for identifying changes in the operating conditions of the water supply system (WSS) for the CMFMC facilities. To identify the typical operating conditions of water supply facilities, an approach is proposed that involves the analysis of daily water consumption profiles (WCPs). The formation of a database, the formation of groups of the same type of daily WCPs, and the construction of typical daily WCPs for typical groups and their description are the main stages of the proposed approach. The database contains a set of classification characteristics that describe the daily water consumption and its unevenness, as well as the shape of the daily WCP. The principal component analysis was applied to determine the dominant components of daily water consumption. A set of morphometric parameters was used to describe the shape of the daily WCPs. The methods of cluster and discriminant analysis were used to identify the influence of seasonality and social factors on water consumption and to form groups of the same type of daily WCPs. The analysis of sets of similar type of daily WCPs for typical days of typical seasons was carried out for a formalized description of the typical operating conditions of water supply facilities. The results of the analysis are the clarification of the equations of the dominant components of daily water consumption, the determination of the average values of the characteristics of daily water consumption, and the construction and description of typical daily WCPs for typical operating conditions of water supply facilities. The research results were obtained on the basis of the data of the monitoring systems for water supply enterprises in Ukraine and Poland in 2021–2022. The obtained results are the basis for planning the water supply process and adjusting the operation modes of WSS pumping stations for the CMFMC, as well as planning power consumption for typical operating conditions, which will contribute to increasing the efficiency of water and electricity use."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942c878c28a0473b79a4","5e709285878c28a0473972de","5e709284878c28a047397212"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"4519","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64a2ac93409707320730ea01","64a2ac0a409707320730d54e","5e709284878c28a047397212","5e709285878c28a0473972de","5e70942c878c28a0473b79a4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"647461194097071010932e75","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"11","documentHash":"e786aa17-dd21-4b26-8f63-83d2e0aa76f4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["discriminant analysis","energy efficiency","management","city multifloor manufacturing cluster","demand monitoring","cluster analysis","water consumption profile"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058710657"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64a27f2640970732072e685f","name":"Korczyńska","lastName":"Iga","documentHash":"070f4929-c71d-401f-a23b-6fd83a80feef"},{"objectId":"64a27f2640970732072e685e","name":"Kostecki","lastName":"Tomasz","documentHash":"67a0bb8d-b338-4dfc-90d6-9b3978837074"},{"objectId":"64a27f2640970732072e685d","name":"Dobrzyńska","lastName":"Renata","documentHash":"0ad64bb2-0ef3-437a-b777-b9173db4c2af"},{"objectId":"64a27f2640970732072e685c","name":"Scheibe","lastName":"Mieczysław","documentHash":"b7c3bec1-408f-4b23-b5d3-7f6c16864a22"},{"objectId":"602f697d9543c7410626f451","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Kostecka","uuid":"FAE53E36C71E8923119AB6D89173C662086FA2DD2608FD7E31A8C3666677341813238759D174B2137EF28B374924B62E9809C7F32662F65A42523967BDD92095","orcidId":"0009-0006-5357-6531","documentHash":"db446977-45e0-46ed-b86a-5a86a1b9bf9e"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a047399503","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"BRYLL","uuid":"13D123B097AC3EB05B1642D9ABFD8FF54BF3FB711A1422A1D9C9A61508C1C306B42CA9AA50376A6C11E7722AFEE773DA2BBB111F589C91CFD5ADDB293A85B49B","orcidId":"0000-0002-2437-9356","documentHash":"8c36dae4-15c7-4c39-af4b-b8ecafad343a"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972eb","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"ŚLĄCZKA","uuid":"759D7BBB207B434EFA81A5CA6F08F7D206BED69E025A0F821F004076FA7A0CDD9783E41F2B94B43A5AE5CF41E1690AD8A01EDD81784FB6469F9F64AD37799A08","orcidId":"0000-0003-3265-9726","documentHash":"c3a0236f-a4c1-4ffe-8618-771c3f20fc03"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64a27f2640970732072e685a","doi":"10.3390/app13105832","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/10/5832","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Evaluation of Fire Resistance of Polymer Composites with Natural Reinforcement as Safe Construction Materials for Small Vessels","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In small vessels, for example, yachts, polymer–glass composites are mainly used for their construction. However, the disposal and/or recycling of composite units is very difficult. It is advisable to solve the problem of disposing of post-consumer items as soon as possible. Therefore, alternative, environmentally friendly, but also durable and safe construction materials are being sought. Such materials can be polymer–natural composites, which can be used as a potential material (alternative to polymer–glass composites) for the construction of small vessels. However, its performance properties should be investigated as new construction materials. The possibility of using polymer–hemp composites was assessed in terms of safety, i.e., the fire resistance of these materials. This paper compares selected characteristics that the reaction of composite materials has to fire with glass fiber and hemp fiber reinforcements. During the study, a natural composite reinforced with hemp fabric was investigated. Based on the laboratory test, it was found that this composite showed better susceptibility to energy recycling, with a relatively small deterioration in fire resistance compared to the composite reinforced with glass fiber. This material could therefore be a potential construction material for small vessels if we consider fire resistance in terms of the safety of the vessel’s operation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972eb","5e70929f878c28a047399503","602f697d9543c7410626f451"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"5832","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929f878c28a047399503","602f697d9543c7410626f451","64a27f2640970732072e685c","64a27f2640970732072e685d","64a27f2640970732072e685e","5e709285878c28a0473972eb","64a27f2640970732072e685f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences-Basel","issn":"2076-3417","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"01301afc-a0dc-4e98-8fba-0ab08483b798"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646b3b2a409707633dfa3b34","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"10","doi":"","documentHash":"0c14c940-fb9b-4530-8f0c-c793b27b0314"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["safety","structure","fire resistance","glass composites","small vessels","yachts"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058711307"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e05249f7","name":"PAULINA","lastName":"MITAN-ZALEWSKA","uuid":"F08AA16A010522E1203E2ADC1D85A1277B9FC60ACAEE721C33AB20BD848D6EEA2AC7F78358479296FC21D44994EE0E4FC900B8850967571089BC41AE7BAEC8BC","orcidId":"0000-0002-4652-1739","documentHash":"b4e4ef04-0315-4994-88b8-93ba75d2efad"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397275","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"KOZAK","uuid":"6686F8D2AE6BEC141649DA7093335B0B2837BDE8ADAAEA334F02AC73C33CD43BDABAEF1350DBE6098DB83B1B6950F00829B7B2941CAD447337B4CEF4AF3B0109","orcidId":"0000-0002-0062-1590","documentHash":"f563722f-8d8b-42f0-8e8b-d2225ee9ca9d"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739726b","name":"OLEH","lastName":"KLYUS","uuid":"A6125A6D7042694805585D228FF1E11710B26ABCEDE2484011D0B952D80C118EF0DB72DEF3A5165A412B59EE01656260D1DDEB45EA9931E127193648A3F8D6A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-9849-5974","documentHash":"ab147927-87b8-491c-a616-48178c5528b2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64abe0c840970762a240fab3","doi":"10.3390/en16135163","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/13/5163","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Effective Parameters of a Compression-Ignition Engine Powered by a Mixture Consisting of Ethyl-Tetra-Butyl Ether and Diesel Fuel","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present article presents the results of analytical research on the possibility of using a mixture consisting of diesel oil and ethyl-tertiary-butyl ether in different percentages of EETB to power compression-ignition engines. The calculations were carried out for a four-stroke diesel engine intended for use as a power generator, among other things. In order to illustrate and verify the correctness of the calculations, a mathematical model was built that confirmed the correctness of the calculations. The calculations focused on a thorough analysis of the elemental composition (content of individual elements) of the fuel and, in particular, the carbon content in the fuel. A calculation algorithm was applied for mixing diesel fuel with ethyl-tertiary butyl ether in a share of EETB 5% + 95% ON, 10% EETB + 90% ON, 20% EETB ++80% ON, 30% EETB + 70% ON, 40% EETB + 60% ON. In this study, it determined the parameters of the working medium, the parameters of the environment and residual gases, and the processes (charge filling, compression, combustion, expansion) and effective parameters of the engine. The calculations used in this study led to heat balance, and a summary of the obtained results and their comparison with diesel oil are also described in this study. The results show the feasibility of using a mixture of ethyl-tertiary-butyl ether as a fuel in diesel engines. The results are very similar to those for 100% diesel. The results of our calculations confirming the possibility of using ether for fuel and thus maintaining similar engine operating

transport systems is a challenge for modern and dynamically developing urban areas in accordance with the concept of sustainable and Smart Cities. Increasingly, there is a need to promote and adapt urban space to the movement of vulnerable road users (VRU). As part of a clear emphasis on the issue of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, the aim of the article is to define the typology and hierarchy of solutions contributing to the increase in VRU safety in cities. The research process was based on the use of grounded theory. In the adopted research methodology, the use of the Delphi method made it possible to identify the approach of various European cities to the use and implementation of technical, technological and organizational solutions affecting safety. The research made it possible to evaluate individual solutions in VRU safety management and to indicate a list of recommendations for improving security, taking into account the views of international experts. In addition, the results of this study may enrich the current literature, helping to understand the perception of solutions implemented in urban transport systems as a holistic set of interrelated elements supporting pedestrian safety and increasing their role in cities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094be878c28a0473c2f2f","5e709295878c28a04739878d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"10568","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709295878c28a04739878d","5e7094be878c28a0473c2f2f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64955f1a4097075a05ce1702","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"13","doi":"","documentHash":"50ee384f-d2a6-4edb-8f37-efd88f3de139"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["traffic measurements","transportation safety","sustainable traffic modes","urban transport systems","perceived safety","vulnerable road users","grounded theory research"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058717983"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64abfb2240970762a242ef91","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Lewicki","documentHash":"fe851e3c-d2a7-434f-b03e-d4bd584ec45d"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f","name":"JAROMIR","lastName":"MYSŁOWSKI","uuid":"8ABC36B4EFDB49B6F02207FDB71D428632BF913305051EB0AB5211D4E0E0B01ECD75C85CAE5C5C4E966C716F6F381C79E06CA0922404FDDB79F4A1FCDA90B6D9","orcidId":"0000-0002-5464-7622","documentHash":"c5370dca-4288-4a36-a4cd-21f6188b816c"}],"objectId":"64abfb2240970762a242ef8e","publicUri":"https://ibima.org/accepted-paper/how-the-military-conflict-in-eastern-europe-affected-the-automotive-sector-case-study-poland/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"How the Military Conflict in Eastern Europe Affected the Automotive Sector – Case Study Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The available literature on the subject emphasizes that contemporary armed conflicts are related to economic and business aspects as never before.

The problem of using mobile phones in moving vehicles has been largely resolved; however, there is a visible high percentage of pedestrians and cyclists who are used to checking their devices while moving in traffic. The aim of the article is to get acquainted with the issues of using mobile phones by pedestrians when crossing a pedestrian crossing and to escalate the problem. Despite the introduction of a ban on the use of mobile phones when crossing a pedestrian crossing in the Polish law on road traffic, many road users still use phones. The conducted observation shows that at least 2 out of 10 people pass through the pedestrian crossing with a mobile phone in their hand."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972d6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"12676","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ae67c14097077279afc6fc","64ae67c14097077279afc6fd","64ae67c14097077279afc6fe","5e709285878c28a0473972d6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences-Basel","issn":"2076-3417","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"01301afc-a0dc-4e98-8fba-0ab08483b798"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6391e95a40970764e084b771","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"24","doi":"","documentHash":"7a9e9e54-67e6-4e23-9599-97e60a53f863"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["road accidents","safety","mobile phones","pedestrians"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058720759"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a047398792","name":"MARIUSZ","lastName":"NÜRNBERG","uuid":"611C6B9520888F4F9FC1C661F65AB65D9BE18FBB4B89C5A2A9764D7BAAE6EC3BE66E78812C7AB27D6AF28C775761C4941C784F823FE49156BC402164AD3D45B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4275-1350","documentHash":"96a5086f-ccf1-4d13-93c7-96f8c6fd95aa"},{"objectId":"5e7091f7878c28a04738dce2","name":"MARIUSZ","lastName":"JEDLIŃSKI","uuid":"FE32B4379F4773E30ECCC934EEA2804C18B4B44DEAEBD05D92C860F8892D31BDBE80849F1FE208F6477B416288F0721DBFBCA2A30204B8C7782352045374DED8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4227-2755","documentHash":"86c8be66-5730-457f-92fb-eae238ebca6c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64ae5d2f4097077279af1909","doi":"10.3390/en15249573","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/24/9573","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Application of the Experimental Method in the Assessment of the Electromobility Paradigm for Courier Shipments in an Urban Agglomeration","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The main idea of this article is to identify the benefits of the full vehicle substitution process for a fully sustainable Urban Freight Transport (UFT) in economic, social, and environmental terms, based on the application of the experimental method. The scientific assumption was made that Electric Delivery Vehicles (EFV) can be complementary in the first stage, and only in the next stage, substitutable to the traditional diesel-powered fleet servicing transport (courier) tasks within the delivery limits in the Szczecin Agglomeration. To assess the level of substitutability, observational instruments were used, while ensuring an active modification of the studied phenomenon (introduction to the operation of selected routes of electric vehicles). The focus was on three key elements, the environment, rules, and regularities. The article presents the architecture of such experiments regarding 22 selected routes, which allowed for the calculation of selected performance indicators for ex-ante evaluation in planning delivery scenarios. The results were verified using a simulation-based approach in the Szczecin Metropolitan Area. As a result, it made it possible to find answers to the research questions posed, in particular: is it possible to fully replace combustion-engine vans with electric ones, and what integrated benefits can be identified, and their systematics has been illustrated in the proposed proprietary model “Electromobility Octagon Profit”. Future research could extend the theoretical knowledge by further exploring the development processes for the use of electric vehicles in the urban freight transport system and by adding insights from other contexts, stakeholders, and theoretical areas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709295878c28a047398792","5e7091f7878c28a04738dce2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"9573","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091f7878c28a04738dce2","5e709295878c28a047398792"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6396de06409707231272458f","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"24","documentHash":"ded6a837-c734-4996-a6be-874f26418052"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["city logistics","electromobility","electric freight vehicles"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058720902"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5b9d","name":"TADEUSZ","lastName":"UHL","uuid":"473D39C8E7F1CAABD48E0C5827230EA1B91FA26A55D6763386454C45D8743DBA67AFAE55B76546207E732FCB6F94CDBC50C7E7DAA17564024031FD0BB4BB1FFA","orcidId":"0000-0001-6849-9168","documentHash":"2d110101-78bb-434b-ac0b-b152055b559f"}],"objectId":"64ae8b954097077279b204b8","doi":"10.26636/jtit.2022.166022","publicUri":"https://www.il-pib.pl/czasopisma/JTIT/2022/4/61.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Reliability of Communication Systems Used in Offshore Wind Farm","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the era of renewable energy, offshore wind farms play a very important role. The number of such installations in Europe is increasing rapidly. With the growing capacity of wind turbines installed in these farms (3, 5, 10 MW), the profitability of this type of energy systems plays an increasing role. The number of wind energy turbines installed at offshore wind farms is growing constantly as well. Once installed, the power plants must be under constant technical supervision, with reliability of electronic communication systems being a particularly important aspect in the operation of offshore wind farms. Considerations focusing on this subject form the very core of this paper. After an introduction to offshore wind farms, the following aspects will be discussed: redundant topologies, e.g. multiple HiPERRings, redundant switches and routers within the backbone networks, redundancy of the transmission media used, alternative transmission technologies, e.g. WLANs (IEEE 802.11h, IEEE 802.11g).

Box-corer samples from six stations in individual depth layers 0–3, 3–5, 5–10, 10–20 cm were collected from 4300–4500 m depth. The deep-sea sediments were classified as clayey-siliceous oozes according to the mineral and grain-size analyses. The chemical composition of the studied samples is compatible with that of pelagic sediments. Manganese content varies from 0.16% to 0.70% being the highest in the geochemically active layer (top 7–12 cm) and decreases with depth. The Mn/Fe ratio, Ba, Co, Ni and Cu have the highest values in the first (0–3) and second (3–5) layers and decrease with depth. REE range is 195.84–357.79 ppm showing low variation between the layers. PAAS-normalized REE patterns show significant enrichment of MREE and HREE with strong negative Ce anomaly and weak positive Eu and Y anomalies.

Monitoring ship movements in the area of an offshore wind farm has a significant impact on the safety not only of the wind farm itself, but also on the safety of navigation. The study investigated the monitoring of ship traffic in the area of the Southern Baltic Sea in the region of planned wind farms to identify risks associated with new offshore renewable energy projects. Design/Methodology/Approach: The analysis of hazards and their consequences in the study area was carried out using the risk matrix method. The study was based on AIS data from the years 2021, 2020 and 2019, related to the area of the planned project and adjacent areas. Risk identification and analysis was performed for the three life stages of the wind farm: construction, operation and decommissioning. Findings: Based on the research and analysis of extensive information on the traffic of vessels including various vessel types and functions, the authors have made an in-depth analysis of maritime safety around planned investment projects related to the construction of renewable energy sources along the Polish coast. The results made it possible to identify factors affecting navigational safety, as well as to analyse the risks associated with vessel traffic in the vicinity of planned wind farms. Practical Implications: The results obtained in the study allow the estimation of navigational safety in the region around wind farms in the Southern Baltic Sea. Originality/Value: Numerous investments in renewable energy sources such as offshore wind farms are planned along the Polish coast in the years to come. Investing in offshore wind energy ideally addresses Europe's current energy problems and European projects, which include the need to replace coal-fired power stations with much more environmentally friendly sources of renewable energy. An essential factor in planning such future investments is navigational safety in the vicinity of these facilities. This analysis is a new approach to identifying the various risks associated with the construction of wind farms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a04739727a","5e709285878c28a04739729d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"XXVI","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"595-611","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a04739729d","5e709284878c28a04739727a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dc39","mniswId":"22361","title":"European Research Studies Journal","issn":"1108-2976","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e13ec1b4-9fe9-4c4d-9da5-bd3082096ed5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64b63f2d4097072492af6778","year":"2023","volume":"XXVI","documentHash":"28ae63a3-010e-4a2e-b208-1540d154517e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["AIS","wind farm structures","offshore wind energy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058739376"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64b670ed4097072492b297a5","name":"Marek","lastName":"Jaśkiewicz","documentHash":"9f5878ff-6b7e-4e7e-8305-ececc0929246"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972d9","name":"DARIUSZ","lastName":"TARNAPOWICZ","uuid":"B2F02446E4E95D09304ED7E7491C0B7D2AE99EB31D6FF1BF764F887969968F5FBF2DC02529ABCC9FF3FEAFF38527EFCA11C2110CDDC46DE85D51FAD2569698E7","orcidId":"0000-0002-9456-2316","documentHash":"9dd63c94-31b7-4b82-a056-3203ea65be2a"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397278","name":"ARKADIUSZ","lastName":"NERĆ","uuid":"9CE279AB5D215F7F9B6B7357365E2CA5658B6C9FC33FA791F88A65A26157EB9EA98726EDE03275C3E0A2B91C6763269726978E1D17C59DC5455A41957FC6D510","orcidId":"0000-0003-1875-1331","documentHash":"50de171d-b709-47f2-9454-43edec93cec0"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739721c","name":"SERGEI","lastName":"GERMAN-GALKIN","uuid":"5CB13DE91564D2C3D724071B040DBED856B10448CF58C302BE54F33DA41D2C3D59DA23D1FF8186AB5FE70131A348466509E908DD37E0B380874CEA27821EC0D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-9342-7630","documentHash":"d1e715cd-0aad-441b-85db-6353eb124db8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64b670ed4097072492b297a4","doi":"10.3390/en16073158","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/7/3158","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Improving the Energy Efficiency of a Ship’s Power Plant by Using an Autonomous Hybrid System with a PMSG","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In ship systems, diesel power generators are used in various systems of autonomous power plants to ensure power supply security. This article presents an autonomous hybrid system of a ship power plant with a diesel generator with a permanent magnet synchronous generator and electricity storage in parallel topology (the permanent magnet synchronous generator is connected directly to the receiving network). The electricity storage through the active converter is connected to the receiving network in parallel with the permanent magnet synchronous generator. The decoupled control of the reactive and active power in the active converter enables stabilization of the voltage in the ship’s electrical power grid while ensuring the possibility of obtaining different operating regimes of the power plant at various stages of the ship’s operation. The innovative method of voltage stabilization presented in this article is based on the compensation of the unfavorable reaction of the permanent magnet synchronous generator armature through the optimal transmission of negative inductive reactive power from the active converter to the generator using the electromagnetic properties of the synchronous generator. The active converter controls the direction of the active power transmission between the DC source, the grid, and the permanent magnet synchronous generator. This paper proposes a hybrid autonomous power plant system using battery storage in place of a single diesel generator set against the commonly used two diesel generator sets, working in parallel, to increase the energy efficiency of the power plant by minimizing the specific fuel consumption of the diesel generator set. The article examines the possibilities of such a mechatronic system design based on analytical research and analysis of electromagnetic and energy characteristics using the Matlab-Simulink program."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972d9","5e709284878c28a047397278"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"3158","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972d9","5e709284878c28a04739721c","5e709284878c28a047397278","64b670ed4097072492b297a5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6422cbbf4097075f21b9d150","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"16","number":"7","documentHash":"3ec71700-7e5b-4392-b64a-64032d90841e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["energy efficiency","permanent magnet synchronous generator","ship power plant","voltage control","hybrid power system","power transmission"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058739537"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a047397282","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"NOZDRZYKOWSKI","uuid":"A1EBCDD60DF80F7E4BF42F0D714D512D1D7495092AF8B8B466F74A745FA3B90AA864E275266B949A28C1ADB21BC37C0068DC564F19612486BF6EAF57B7C35735","orcidId":"0000-0003-2785-0868","documentHash":"63530bfa-f94e-4127-8fe5-1f36fef2b046"}],"objectId":"64ba31e44097070998d890ba","publicUri":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991053035947505066&context=L&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&lang=pl&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=LibraryCatalog&query=any,contains,Warunki%20i%20kryteria%20poprawnej%20oceny%20stanu%20geometrycznego%20wielkogabarytowych%20wa%C5%82%C3%B3w%20korbowych&offset=0","type":"BOOK","typeName":"Książka","year":2022,"title":"Warunki i kryteria poprawnej oceny stanu geometrycznego wielkogabarytowych wałów korbowych","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"W monografii przedstawiono usystematyzowany zbiór zagadnień prezentowanychW monografii przedstawiono usystematyzowany zbiór zagadnień prezentowanychw chronologicznej kolejności, związanych z problematyką pomiarów specyficznej grupyelementów maszyn, jakimi są wielkogabarytowe wały silników okrętowych.

Office meetings have since moved to virtual spaces. Unfortunately, remote video meetings have become associated with declines in engagement, collaboration, and learning, as well as ‘Zoom fatigue’. In this article, we study the potential of virtual reality (VR) technology as a solution to these problems and as a medium to enrich remote work environments. For seven weeks, we collected data on the meetings of a team of eighteen knowledge workers. For five of those weeks, the meetings were organized in VR. We used a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods to gather feedback on those sessions and to compare them with a regular video conferencing baseline. Our results demonstrate that both technologies have applications in the work environment—albeit in different situations.

Rapeseed biomass represents a difficult-to-handle cargo, mainly due to its sensitivity to mechanical, climatic, and biological impacts, as well as its dusty nature. This study aims to determine the physical properties of rapeseed meals and their fractions. Morphological and chemical features of six particle sets are investigated in order to explain the variation in their physical properties having importance in handling and transportation processes. The true density of fractions increases when the particle size decreases due to the diminishing quantitative share of seed coats. No correlation is observed between true and bulk densities, as the particle shape, surface sculpture, and adhesion affect the mutual particle arrangements. Along with a decrease in the particle size from 0.4 mm, a rapid decrease in the flowability is observed. The tendency of the finest dust (d < 0.075 mm) to form agglomerated complexes causes its lower bulk density, higher porosity, and higher angles of repose in comparison to coarse dust (0.075–0.4 mm). It is concluded that a relatively low tendency to free flowing of natural RSM is mainly caused by its wide-ranging particle size distribution and their geometry differentiation, which facilitate mutual particle interlockings. The known cases of blockages of silos, bins, hoppers, and transfer chutes may be mainly caused by the powder fractions (< 0.2 mm), with a much lower flowability than other particles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397204"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"74","issue":"146","pagesFromTo":"5-15","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397204"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a6e6","mniswId":"18270","title":"Scientific Journals of the Maritime University of Szczecin-Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii Morskiej w Szczecinie","issn":"1733-8670","eissn":"2392-0378","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fdb820fa-cedd-41fe-95cd-b3a078aeeee6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6466070c4097074d0a92d3f6","year":"2023","number":"74 (146)","documentHash":"e058c8fd-72d7-4120-8708-9819ef763576"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biomass","rapeseed meal","agricultural commodities","bulk storage","logistics vulnerability"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058753167"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca588c4097077ac1d00507","name":"Wiktor","lastName":"Mujta","documentHash":"bcd8426e-ac92-4118-9cb7-b4335d9baf7a"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972d5","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Stateczny","uuid":"B5967EACC00C242891B204E0F8F0C928867EECAA2AE704CC3B9DE7A7DAB2D3F9101C31976D000FF0F83399576F793EA869A442DDD63B43B42A6DC5917FF37F2C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4671-6827","documentHash":"772720b9-b638-4d76-b1e3-8af00f62a0d6"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c4","name":"MARTA","lastName":"WŁODARCZYK-SIELICKA","uuid":"E2672257D6548CB96A156323A538F169F850F21A9FCDF2CCE6C1D494DF5C18285AB32B3B9087F4704502FEE31B5D7C1D165D35505CD85ED9DCF844B04A45FD6D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7489-8437","documentHash":"e1658e70-952e-4244-bb79-494498fb1350"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64a2798940970732072e0cd2","doi":"10.3390/s23125445","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5445","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Testing the Effect of Bathymetric Data Reduction on the Shape of the Digital Bottom Model","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Depth data and the digital bottom model created from it are very important in the inland and coastal water zones studies and research.

Data reduction is an approach that is meant to reduce the size of the input dataset to make it easier and more efficient for analysis, transmission, storage and similar. For the purposes of this article, test datasets were created by discretizing a selected polynomial function. The real dataset, which was used to verify the analyzes, was acquired using an interferometric echosounder mounted on a HydroDron-\\n1 autonomous survey vessel. The data were collected in the ribbon of Lake Klodno, Zawory. Data reduction was conducted in two commercial programs. Three equal reduction parameters were adopted for each algorithm. The research part of the paper presents the results of the conducted analyzes of the reduced bathymetric datasets based on the visual comparison of numerical bottom models, isobaths, and statistical parameters. The article contains tabular results with statistics, as well as the spatial visualization of the studied fragments of numerical bottom models and isobaths.

The flash point tFP, calculated cetane index CCI, density ρ, coefficient of the temperature density change ε, kinematic viscosity ν, dynamic viscosity η, viscosity index VI, and lubricity during a High-Frequency Reciprocating Rig (HFFR) test (x, y, WSD, and WS1.4) and lubricating conditions during an HFFR test (oil film resistance FILM and friction coefficient μ) were determined. The test was performed for the oil mixtures of the lubricating oil of the SAE 30 and SAE 40 viscosity grades, which were diluted with the biodiesel blend (D93B7—diesel oil with 7% v/v fatty acid methyl esters, FAME) at concentrations of diesel oil in the mixture equal to 0% (pure lubricating oil), 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, and 75% m/m, respectively. The experiment confirmed the existence of clear relationships between the increase in the dilution of lubricating oil with tested biodiesel blend and tFP, ρ, ε, ν, η, and VI, and the deterioration of lubrication conditions. It is recommended to take remedial action even in the case of low diesel oil concentration (<5% m/m) in the lubricating oil due to tFP, ν, and η changes. Simultaneously, the tests showed no significant effect on the lubricity and the CCI. The critical contamination of oil with fuel in the range of 2–5% by weight, as indicated in the literature, still allowed for a certain “safety margin” regarding these parameters. However, when the concentration of diesel fuel in the lubricating oil exceeded 5–8% m/m, the deterioration of the lubrication was expressed by a decrease in FILM and an increase in μ was observed; hence, such a contamination should be considered excessive. When the concentration of diesel fuel exceeds 10% by weight, there is a serious risk of engine damage during operation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397277","5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"5056","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245","5e709284878c28a047397277","649ebd3740970725a1096016"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"649ebd3740970725a1096015","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"13","documentHash":"8f580a10-cf71-46ba-90e1-b2da9cd30b19"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mechanical wear","crankcase explosion","lubricating oil properties","oil dilution with distillation fuel","high-frequency reciprocating rig","HFFR","anti-wear properties","lubricity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058753410"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094f6878c28a0473c80dd","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"KAPUŚCIŃSKI","uuid":"B32A32EADED44FEDCDE83CB202DDC51CD069C84844AE23EF6DF541A20AEBD2EED5FE67C86D060E91B457A8B334EF62880827D3CAF32962966DD4C8532F0A6690","orcidId":"0000-0002-7680-0608","documentHash":"bcd71568-83b9-4276-ac1b-70a91ad2e353"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c6","name":"ANNA","lastName":"WOLNOWSKA","uuid":"FF75E3DA7ABDDDC6886D370AEEB9195B1BC2442921231AF1C016067E8726C5CDC6C692EDB04B1A973D7FF95DE6CE1C366E78B39E24D385B40844677400AB6A35","orcidId":"0000-0003-4074-5747","documentHash":"9c762f5e-1b1a-4ef2-a37a-0524db34f077"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972a6","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"PLESKACZ","uuid":"0971E162AFD0D01CA79627518C6DEED1E18F3837C64BDD64509B8F4B4D68EC0C49CDE1CD46CB0AD91F70600069406E5B2EA6E29FE06A35EFC825B2718EC15DF4","orcidId":"0000-0002-4296-1243","documentHash":"da54ba49-8fac-4a17-a334-9c95ac32d6a2"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397221","name":"LECH","lastName":"KASYK","uuid":"D4E1AF8525D000E24B40B4327B84B26C11B14FC0AE51B25E3CA6EF897DDA00563B6EEF017851659581ED3236C3C714C1EC058722F2826FE1445EA173E424F98D","orcidId":"0000-0002-4719-0695","documentHash":"1b83e982-6aee-4f77-a509-03ac43d88035"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64a2a0eb40970732073028fc","doi":"10.3390/app13116780","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/11/6780","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Analysis of Social and Situational Systems as Components of Human Errors Resulting in Navigational Accidents","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"As in any industry exposed to risk, human and organizational factors are the main stakes of maritime safety. Understanding the causes and risks of maritime accidents is integral to the sustainability of shipping. The investigation of marine accidents is a crucial tool for their identification in areas related to operations and ships, including social and situational systems, their design, and technical systems. The authors conducted a cause–effect analysis of marine incidents. For this purpose, case-by-case analysis and an Ishikawa diagram were used, which is a tool that helps identify actual or potential causes of accidents. The study showed that by far the most significant cross-section of causes of accidents were elements of social and situational systems that affect the safety of the ship, crew, and environment. The least significant contribution came from the machinery area. Through the detailed descriptions, a picture emerges not so much of a lack of knowledge of the regulations as of a failure to comply with existing procedures or best practices. In the authors’ opinion, more emphasis is needed on preventive measures, including safety culture, training, competence assessment, and increased awareness of the need for sustainability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972a6","5e709285878c28a0473972c6","5e7094f6878c28a0473c80dd","5e709284878c28a047397221"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"6780","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397221","5e709285878c28a0473972c6","5e709285878c28a0473972a6","5e7094f6878c28a0473c80dd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences-Basel","issn":"2076-3417","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"01301afc-a0dc-4e98-8fba-0ab08483b798"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646f1d584097076e9c3e34d1","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"13","number":"11","documentHash":"8261e445-adc9-4575-8386-c1a0e9dbe046"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ishikawa diagram","marine accidents","navigation","safety","sustainability","social systems","situational systems"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058753493"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739726b","name":"OLEH","lastName":"KLYUS","uuid":"A6125A6D7042694805585D228FF1E11710B26ABCEDE2484011D0B952D80C118EF0DB72DEF3A5165A412B59EE01656260D1DDEB45EA9931E127193648A3F8D6A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-9849-5974","documentHash":"ab147927-87b8-491c-a616-48178c5528b2"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397224","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"GAWDZIŃSKA","uuid":"C6778D72E64A8693E71E8B4B3185176E02F27A2FBAC7C826FE10E52C1DE5C39FA8AF9E6CD9F255C1337381FDAC2C89900863455120FE2999A88DE6A876E35906","orcidId":"0000-0001-6989-6966","documentHash":"e6eca669-ec45-405e-9b6f-636b1b2cd1a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6459e165409707019f32873f","doi":"10.3390/en16093915","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/9/3915","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Particles Morphology of MechanicallyGenerated Oil Mist Mixtures of SAE 40 Grade Lubricating Oil with Diesel Oil in the Context of Explosion Risk in the Crankcase of a Marine Engine","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article presents research results on mechanically generated oil mists.

In the shipping market, it allows for a wide spectrum of integration of corporate management areas: shipowners’ financial condition, environmental protection, work safety, seafarers’ health, and stable cooperation with shippers. The aim of this paper is to create a deeper understanding of how and which emerging technologies accelerate sustainability strategy of shipping companies. Three research perspectives have been adopted. The first one is aimed to examine shipowners’ approach to emerging technologies as a tool to improve their corporate sustainability performance. The second perspective gives a view of trends in the development of emerging technologies in shipping and how they related to sustainability. Taking the third perspective, we examine how effective, in the opinion of future seafarers, the use of emerging technologies is in improving corporate sustainability of shipping companies. The research methods for each of the perspectives are, respectively, a sustainability reports and ships’ registry data analysis, a patent analysis, and a questionnaire survey analysis. The results prove that shipowners use not only certain management practices, but also new technologies to enhance corporate sustainability. The transition to sustainable shipping will continue for many years to come and all shipping companies will have to become part of it."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c7","5e709285878c28a0473972de"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"12475","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972c7","5e709285878c28a0473972de"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633139ff4097073dc8674766","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"19","documentHash":"ef433b41-ea6b-44f5-b733-b7b260f37ca5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CSR","environmental protection","shipping","technology","corporate sustainability"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058773070"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c7","name":"NATALIA","lastName":"WAGNER","uuid":"26E53CDC2FD3099002948F30AA2D35392306E07B07818599B3E7D17A8D7F2EE9ED0B1B30B78FCD2C46741A3A2084611956C050ED59175CB2D0CBFD32C7925C1D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6898-4737","documentHash":"ba5e1d6d-7560-4ad8-9072-54e365477c50"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397272","name":"ALEKSANDRA","lastName":"ŁAPKO","uuid":"AFE1174BBB371C6ABD9C370F9797DA40368D7E7C34C5CF7FB3DFB719F331E631C4775DC6D3DC5332773B607803D17C71076EBCF7FAFF6B357EC51A2E03727811","orcidId":"0000-0003-0235-6329","documentHash":"0f57227e-e7bb-45d9-998f-f541d49c789a"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397225","name":"EWA","lastName":"HĄCIA","uuid":"F42EF81ABD18219FD25F57CC9992D41257D9428883BBECDB1AF297E85BE5039D4C2C964CD231EA0AC7F4966F664185E1C57DAB5B620CB42A0ADE13BEECD6C5ED","orcidId":"0000-0003-4865-7901","documentHash":"37e25853-a96f-487f-8acf-092b7c9404f6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64acfecd4097076ac0ace0bd","doi":"10.3390/en16010175","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/1/175","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Importance of City Logistics for Urban Tourism Development: Searching for a New Research Field","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the results of a study on city logistics in the urban tourist area as a research field.

In the era of decarbonisation, city logistics and tourism must define new rules for coexistence. The identified dominant subfields (tourism, logistics, urban transport, urban development and planning, new technologies, and sustainable development) and the links between them have pointed to some research gaps and suggested a direction for further research. The research procedure applied, adapted to the overall goal of the study, consists of an analysis of publications in the Scopus database (February 2022). A keyword co-occurrence network for the research field of city logistics in the urban tourist area is constructed with the use of the VOSviewer software. It follows from the analysis that the research area combining city logistics and city tourism remains relatively unexplored. Forming only a small part of research into city logistics, it has unexplored research potential.

The main focus of the article is on control optimization, which allows improving energy efficiency by reducing reactive power in the mechatronic propulsion system. The first method consists in modifying the commonly used field-oriented control (FOC) strategy to ensure zero reactive power in the inverter–PMSM system. Since a characteristic of ship propulsion systems, unlike those used on land, is the step load on the propulsion motor, the system’s performance in dynamic states is particularly important. Unfortunately, control strategies based on FOC do not take into account the dynamics of the system, since they apply only to steady states. Therefore, the authors of this paper, based on control theory methods, proposed an approach that also optimizes control in dynamic states, while minimizing reactive power in the steady state. The analytical studies were confirmed in simulation studies using the MATLAB Simulink package."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972d9","5e709285878c28a0473972d6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"9390","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972d6","5e709285878c28a0473972d9","5e709284878c28a04739721c","64ae64874097077279af9484"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6396de06409707231272458f","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"24","documentHash":"ded6a837-c734-4996-a6be-874f26418052"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["energy optimization","permanent magnet synchronous motor","diesel–electric propulsion"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058773196"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5b9d","name":"TADEUSZ","lastName":"UHL","uuid":"473D39C8E7F1CAABD48E0C5827230EA1B91FA26A55D6763386454C45D8743DBA67AFAE55B76546207E732FCB6F94CDBC50C7E7DAA17564024031FD0BB4BB1FFA","orcidId":"0000-0001-6849-9168","documentHash":"2d110101-78bb-434b-ac0b-b152055b559f"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac079","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Falkowski-Gilski","uuid":"08812B935C5D2310B769BADD5E0C847854D8AED95F09E1480BD136FC0DB38CA745F24DF323EBFE8F99DA61CCB9DF5C2F36A4D80C502AB4E6594D2999906E4AD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8920-6969","documentHash":"17529026-4f30-4844-8a3a-aabea9447f41"}],"objectId":"64abeb2f40970762a241b968","doi":"10.15199/59.2022.4.23","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Badanie jakości transmisji w sieciach komórkowych na przestrzeni lat 2019-2021: wpływ pandemii Covid-19 na poziom świadczonych usług","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Pandemia COVID-19 znacząco ograniczyła mobilność użytkowników, a w szczególności studentów.

methodical approach to increasing the efficiency of a tug with an azimuth stern drive (ASD). The difficulties in the bow-to-bow (as a reverse tractor) operations of an azimuth stern-drive tug, while pulling at the assisted (towed) ship’s bow, are investigated through a parametric study. The authors’ original generic analytical model of a tug in a steady state is utilised. Various design and operation options are also compared, which cover the escort speed, hawser angle, and relative location of the towing point, among others. The latter also means a shift to stern-to-bow operation. The thruster power required and the remaining surplus for executing new alignment (steering) orders are assessed. The study is, thus, aimed at energy savings for the whole operation and, consequently, at long-term harbour-tug-fleet energy effectiveness. The basic output of the present research is the comparison of the behavioural and control patterns of various tug arrangements at a ship’s bow. The results of the study show a slight advantage for a midship winch tug working through her stern for bow operation (stern-to-bow) over the reverse tractor acting bow-to-bow. Comparing various tug designs or operation options is difficult due to complicated tug dynamics and statics patterns under the hawser action. Both relative and absolute towing forces have to be considered (a high relative force may result in a low absolute force, much less than ordered by the pilot), with some geometrical and safety constraints additionally. The practical implementation of the conducted research should cover the guidance and training rendered to tug masters in the scope of the operational limitations of a particular tug and towards the design or acquisition of the tug that is best-suited for a particular harbour operation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w

centers. Practical training, which gives the possibility to practice any typical and unusual sea situations, unexpected events and failures, rescue operations, or maneuvering in restricted areas, is very important. Full mission bridge simulators are widely used in this field. The aim of this conducted research was to verify the usefulness of a multitask navigation bridge simulator in the process of automatic evaluation of anticollision actions executed by a navigator. To achieve that, the available literature was analyzed, several simulations were carried out, and expert studies were performed. The simulations were carried out in the K-Sim Polaris simulator with the participation of students, deck officers, and captains. Expert research was carried out with a group of navigators with different professional experiences. This allowed for verification of the used evaluation criteria and their mutual relations. The results analysis concludes that properly programmed scenarios of testing navigator competence led to an objectivized assessment, which is its important element. However, the key is both the proper programming of the testing scenario as well as the correct selection of the criteria for the assessment itself. Therefore, during test scenario creation, it is necessary to use both the knowledge of experts and a multistage modification of the applied evaluation parameters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w

prawdopodobieństwa wystąpienia określonego zdarzenia niebezpiecznego i konsekwencji związanych z tym niebezpieczeństwem, oparte jest na integracji wielu metod oraz wypracowaniu algorytmu automatycznej jego oceny. Z ogólnej formuły obliczania ryzyka wynika, że analiza ryzyka sprowadza się zawsze do wyboru optymalnej metody, która pozwoli na: identyfikację zagrożeń, oszacowanie ekspozycji na zagrożenia, oszacowanie poziomu prawdopodobieństwa zdarzeń niebezpiecznych, oszacowanie poziomu strat w zdarzeniach niebezpiecznych. Podczas szacowania ryzyka w transporcie morskim trudno jest wskazać jedną metodę. Wybór jest zawsze uzależniony od warunków brzegowych prowadzonych badań dotyczących konkretnego aspektu nawigacji morskiej. W pracy skupiono się na akwenach ograniczonych, a jako reprezentatywny przykład wzięto pod uwagę żeglugę po torze wodnym Świnoujście–Szczecin. Zaprezentowano szereg metod służących m.in. do aktualnej oceny bezpieczeństwa nawigacji przy istniejących warunkach oznakowania nawigacyjnego. Zostało to osiągnięte poprzez przeprowadzenie badań ankietowych wśród pilotów morskich pracujących na co dzień na torze wodnym Świnoujście–Szczecin. Kolejna statystyczna metoda analizowania danych historycznych, jakimi są wypadki morskie, czyli zdarzenia na morzu otwartym lub wodach z nim połączonych, gdzie statki morskie uprawiają żeglugę, pozwoliła wskazać obszary potencjalnie niebezpieczne, które wymagają szczególnej uwagi w kontekście redukcji zdarzeń niepożądanych w przyszłości."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a04739724e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a04739724e"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"9788364434488","pages":143,"translation":false,"publicationPlace":"Szczecin","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb778","mniswId":"11300","name":"Akademia Morska w Szczecinie","documentHash":"cd457f72-563e-49a6-9a9b-0d70cbc60ea5"},"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["bezpieczeństwo nawigacji","ECDIS","zarządzanie bezpieczeństwem","automatyzacja procesu zarządzania bezpieczeństwem"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058805089"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64ba49fd4097070998daef17","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Baszak","documentHash":"3c65d0d4-4067-41ff-afa8-d853f60ca72b"},{"objectId":"64ba49fd4097070998daef16","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Laskowski","documentHash":"58696618-a005-47c1-b7a0-7e16043d91c2"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"}],"objectId":"64ba49fd4097070998daef15","publicUri":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991053055515905066&context=L&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&lang=pl&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=LibraryCatalog&query=any,contains,978-83-64434-40-2","type":"BOOK","typeName":"Książka","year":2022,"title":"Mały angielsko-polski leksykon terminów związanych z eksploatacją zbiornikowców LNG","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W pracy przedstawiono definicje podstawowych haseł związanych z budową, działaniem i eksploatacją zbiornikowców (gazowców) LNG.

The digital industrial revolution has been underway for more than a dozen years. Industry 4.0 and the idea of digital twins (DT) are becoming the focus of virtually all industrial sectors. Some sectors are more predisposed to digitalization, while for others, the process is much more difficult. This mainly depends on the specific characteristics and susceptibility of a given industry, including the current degree of digitalization of companies, as well as the knowledge and mental readiness of employees. The individual characteristics of an industry are important. Shipbuilding is a traditional industry where the level of digitalization is still low. As a result, the efficiency of shipbuilding processes and the quality of ships built are not sufficiently controlled. The article addresses this problem, reviews work in the field of digitalization of shipbuilding processes, and identifies the needs and challenges in this area. The article proposes the concept of a DT system for the entire ship design and production process. Key areas of digitalization of the actual processes were defined, and a division was made into planning, monitoring, and process analysis activities. Special attention was paid to the area of dimensional quality control, and the dimensional quality management metasystem (DQMM) was introduced into the comprehensive DT system. The requirements were defined, and the limitations of the proposed solution were identified, taking into account a number of external factors, including the degree of readiness of the manufacturer—the shipyard. The developed DT system concept was tested using the example of the construction process of a simplified ship. Practical aspects of the implementation of the proposed solution, in particular, DQMM, were pointed out."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a546","5e7092ab878c28a04739a453"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"9733","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a453","5e7092ab878c28a04739a546"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"648c2bea4097077564c49b83","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"15","number":"12","documentHash":"38c25c70-a244-482f-b455-66865c3af353"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["quality management","shipbuilding","shipyard","digital twin system","digitalization","product life cycle","technology applied to maritime industry","dimensional quality control"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058825222"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f97ac52085dcb424e4c1b62","name":"ILONA","lastName":"GARCZYŃSKA -CYPRYSIAK","uuid":"C3BDE8EA2999B0AEBD2A2794E7B7FF9975CE0A142C441D141E7E21C9186CE5FFE1A812CCA33DB8D2E12DEF8444ABDD1A275B4BBA3F5906F6DB19CC911BE89F5D","orcidId":"0000-0003-1709-6777","documentHash":"2495a6e1-979f-4b99-bd9c-15affc57ae8b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"649ecd6640970725a10a4613","doi":"10.17402/562","publicUri":"https://repository.am.szczecin.pl/handle/123456789/2775","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Research and applications of artificial neural networks in spatial analysis: Review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The conducted review presents the possibility of using artificial neural networks in sectors related to environmental protection, agriculture, forestry, land uses, groundwater and bathymetric. Today there is a lot of research in these areas with different research methodologies. The result is the improvement of decision-making processes, design, and prediction of certain events that, with appropriate intervention, can prevent severe consequences for society. The review shows the capabilities to optimize and automate the processes of modeling urban and land dynamics. It examines the forecasts of assessment of the damage caused by natural phenomena. Detection of environmental changes via the analysis of certain time intervals and classification of objects on the basis of different images is presented. The practical aspects of this work include the ability to choose the correct artificial neural network model depending on the complexity of the problem. This factor is a novel element since previously reviewed articles did not encounter a study of the correlation between the chosen model or algorithm, depending on the use case or area of the problem.

Via a calculation of the efficiency index for a set of limiting amplitudes of roll during loading simulation, we are able to analyze ship effectiveness. The application of the above-mentioned method can be employed as a useful tool to predict the lowest allowable significant amplitudes of roll when the required efficiency level is specified. Additionally, a calculation is made for the operable days where cargo operations are possible.

This article determined the mathematical relationships between fuel consumption and operation parameters, such as rotational speed, draught, trim, hull fouling time, wind speed, wave height, and seawater temperature, as well as the hierarchical impact of these parameters on fuel consumption. The study used a dataset of 105,790 measurements taken on a 4,800 TEU container carrier that was in operation for 1,187 days after hull cleaning. Data-driven approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and a Multiple Nonlinear Regression (MNR) with Random Search were used to develop a relationship between the ship operating parameters and fuel consumption. A comparison of statistics between the two methods showed that both ANN and MNR provided highly accurate fuel consumption estimations, with MAPE of 6.1/6.41%, RMSE of 5.01/4.98 t/day, RRMSE of 7.22/7.12%, PCC of 0.964, and R2 of 0.93.

Reducing CO2 emissions in the global economy, including maritime transport, is being pursued in various ways, one of them being the design work leading to the construction and operation of unmanned ships. Unmanned vessels operating on longer routes will still have internal combustion propulsion. However, they will not have the superstructure and the various systems and equipment necessary for the crew. This will result in an unmanned vessel having less weight, less displacement and, therefore, less size, resistance and propulsion power than a manned vessel for the same transport capacity. Consequently, the unmanned vessel will emit less CO2. This paper presents a novel method for predicting fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for unmanned container ships. The method uses regression relationships of geometric and operational parameters for manned container ships developed for this purpose to determine such relationships for unmanned ships. On this basis, it is shown what the level of CO2 reduction will be compared to manned container ships."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a5e6","5e709285878c28a0473972c9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"4818","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972c9","5e7092ac878c28a04739a5e6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6486a68d4097071aeb3e9c5c","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"12","documentHash":"a3663e0b-e5a2-4edc-930e-a9f497bb1d17"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["emissions","fuel consumption","propulsion power","speed","manned and unmanned container ships"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058826059"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64ae72054097077279b05a82","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Wiaterek","documentHash":"20e7e03b-2cdf-4469-8dbc-2120094b42c9"},{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b85d1","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"JAKUBOWSKI","uuid":"CCDC672652B5979C070593104E7F61E3F9DFB4D71AC214D176A3584072B4A5CF26B3BA1B614FB309DA57D91BF340D5403327EF2A25F782A86A8510EE2CCA9656","orcidId":"0000-0002-0331-3147","documentHash":"55041fe5-3c7d-4c5c-b2f1-627564d5ae6b"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64ae72054097077279b05a80","doi":"10.3390/jmse10121850","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/10/12/1850/htm","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Impact of Marine Engine Component Failures upon an Explosion in the Starting Air Manifold","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Based on available sources, the frequency of explosions in the marine engine’s starting air manifolds is determined under real conditions. A cause-and-effect analysis of these explosions and their root causes are identified. A probabilistic model of an explosion in the starting air manifold of a marine engine is built using a fault tree analysis (FTA). Using a stochastic simulation (Monte Carlo) and an exact reliability availability calculation (ERAC) algorithm applied to the developed FTA model, selected reliability measures are calculated to describe an incident of the top event, which involves an explosion in the starting air manifold. For such an event, several factors are calculated, including the availability, the unavailability, the failure frequency, and the mean time to failure. Based on the simulations, the relative frequency of the top event is determined in relation to the number of events that can simultaneously occur and lead to an explosion. The significance of each basic event is assessed to determine their individual impact on the explosion incident. The following measures are used: the Vesely–Fussell measure of importance, the criticality measure of importance, the Birnbaum measure of reliability importance, and the Birnbaum measure of structural importance. The results of the analysis show that defective starting air valves are most responsible for the explosion incident in the starting air manifold. During the first year of the ship’s operation, the reliability does not fall below the value of 0.65, while the mean time to failure and the top event frequency are statistically at the level of one explosion per approximately 2.28 years of continuous engine operation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709438878c28a0473b85d1","5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"1850","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245","64ae72054097077279b05a82","5e709438878c28a0473b85d1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c925","mniswId":"11734","title":"Journal of Marine Science and Engineering","doi":"10.3390/jmse","issn":"2077-1312","eissn":"2077-1312","documentHash":"6c46084a-9d2d-49a2-9b37-3f8bfcae78ad"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64ae72054097077279b05a81","year":"2022","volume":"10","number":"12","documentHash":"cca41b9c-9d09-43c1-be51-d66bd074773c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fire safety","marine engine","starting air manifold","explosion prevention","cause-and-effect analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058835690"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397215","name":"CEZARY","lastName":"BEHRENDT","uuid":"C7460767A0FD33C8E5C7ACE46EBD2FE218FC2DE163B06D3F7F7D439414769B361B4A2631DC9767205C89C1BEF75B440756927BB9E0665476285678C7DD3814BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1403-4802","documentHash":"f8f35665-07fc-4471-92bd-1565eb2e7cda"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64ae6cb54097077279b0166a","doi":"10.3390/en15239203","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/23/9203","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of Waste Heat Utilization on the Efficiency of Marine Main Boilers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"As a result of technological advancements in the 21st century, steam-driven ships, with an efficiency of between 36 and 38%, have been replaced by diesel-driven ships, with an efficiency of up to 55%. Accordingly, the manufacturers of the main boilers and steam turbines in ships have fought for their products to remain on the market by modernizing their construction in order to increase their competitiveness in relation to diesel drives. Based on a review of data in the literature, this article presents an analysis of the increased efficiency of ship boilers with the use of waste heat from boiler exhaust gas. This paper considers the utility of using this heat to heat up the water that supplies the boilers as well as the use of the heated air in the combustion process. The analysis takes into account the different types of heat exchangers used for these purposes and the different efficiencies of boilers made by the leading boiler manufacturers. The formulae and calculation methodologies used are applied in the following analysis of the impact of using waste heat to increase boiler efficiency."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c8","5e709284878c28a047397215"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"9203","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397215","5e709285878c28a0473972c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"637f4f38409707772c20edd2","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"23","documentHash":"30c26638-cece-4599-b2be-12653eead8c8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["marine main boilers","waste heat recovery","feeding water heating","air heating","boilers efficiency"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058836204"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64ae9e2b4097077279b3274a","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Prajwowski","documentHash":"0c7fba6b-5035-494d-a65b-647eef836405"},{"objectId":"64ae9e2b4097077279b32749","name":"Rajewski","lastName":"Przemysław","documentHash":"c64119f2-be74-4860-892b-a0ba3a4a22fb"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739726b","name":"OLEH","lastName":"KLYUS","uuid":"A6125A6D7042694805585D228FF1E11710B26ABCEDE2484011D0B952D80C118EF0DB72DEF3A5165A412B59EE01656260D1DDEB45EA9931E127193648A3F8D6A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-9849-5974","documentHash":"ab147927-87b8-491c-a616-48178c5528b2"}],"objectId":"64ae9e2b4097077279b32747","publicUri":"http://www.pam.edu.ge/article?id=309","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Measuring the fuel consumption of international combustion engines during operation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Due to the increasing awareness of the impact of exhaust emissions on the environment, combined with the continued increases in fuel costs, there is great need for reduction in fuel consumption as well as clean exhaust gases.

Many countries have been involved in helping brutally attacked people, especially mothers and children. The versatile involvement of large powers is monitored and noticeable by the media. Active help from Poland is a very visible sign of human solidarity with the suffering Ukrainian nation. Open hearts, houses and institutions and humanitarian and medical aid are elements of Polish kindness and empathy. The aim of the research was to collect Poles’ opinions about the need to provide humanitarian aid to Ukrainians from the territories of the Russian–Ukrainian war. Capturing feelings of Poles towards Ukrainians during the war is an interesting issue that shows subjective opinions about the existential situation perceived in the space of mutual personal interactions. The results showing opinions on help were collected from a group of 1012 people throughout Poland with the help of an authorial questionnaire. The obtained data shows a positive attitude of Poles to Ukrainians. The most willing to help are people over 49 years old, more often with a good and very good financial situation. Respondents believe that general assistance from other countries and the European Parliament is not sufficient. Military support is accepted the most by the oldest participants of research, and less by the age group up to 30 years who support medical help more. More concerned about the ongoing conflict are respondents under the age of 30 and the least wealthy, including, more often, women. The richest respondents are least afraid of the effects of the ongoing Russian–Ukrainian conflict. The conducted research confirms the openness of Polish society to refugees and brings opinions about existential solidarity with the suffering Ukrainian nation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397263"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"13369","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709381878c28a0473ab706","5e7092d3878c28a04739d87d","5e709284878c28a047397263","615fad2875234017e0505d80","5e70936b878c28a0473a91ee","5e7094f6878c28a0473c8091","5e7092b1878c28a04739adcc","5e7092d3878c28a04739d845"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6346a824409707583916aa91","year":"2022","volume":"19","number":"20","doi":"","documentHash":"36a8593e-8526-4c7f-9e98-06a82b82700e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["subjective feelings","refugees","war","Ukrainians"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058836509"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64b649614097072492b01139","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Jaremba","documentHash":"f160fb52-b9a4-4d4c-b668-f85b6289efaf"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739722e","name":"WITOLD","lastName":"KAZIMIERSKI","uuid":"6632CFA9746CAB3A5BCB8FAA5226A5D03854FBFC9C3D4FB66F7A1787AE16AC9DB2D875B4D5A78DCD80AC6AD8C71DE403C01243BC9A2B22B7CD9D57BADA475911","orcidId":"0000-0002-9637-0457","documentHash":"3799272c-706c-4890-abf9-092b1efabe89"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64b649614097072492b01138","doi":"10.3390/s23115076","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/11/5076","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"On Quality Analysis of Filtration Methods for Bathymetric Data in Harbour Areas through QPS Qimera Software","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents an assessment of the quality of selected filtration methods for the postprocessing of multibeam echosounder data.

In this paper, we propose some quantitative and qualitative factors to perform these assessments, and we analyze a few selected filtration methods as examples. This research makes use of real data gathered in real environments, preprocessed with typical hydrographic flow. The methods presented in this paper may be used in empirical solutions, and the filtration analysis may be useful for hydrographers choosing a filtration method for DBM interpolation. The results showed that both data-oriented and surface-oriented methods can be used in data filtration and that various evaluation methods show different perspectives on data filtration quality assessment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a04739722e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"5076","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a04739722e","64b649614097072492b01139"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"SENSORS","issn":"1424-8220","documentHash":"c8a0faed-8ad8-4c36-9597-a6dc2ad66c22"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64785429409707222e31db94","year":"2023","volume":"23","number":"11","documentHash":"3a1abd7d-abdb-4ca6-bef7-5a3b1d7ecfa1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bathymetry","hydrography","surface modeling","multibeam echosounder","digital bottom model","data filtration"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058861735"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473ae958","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"C6C566491A721A761683A8B062B060EB9B61B5A5DDEE9195614CFE1E0304C45E1D234CF2C158D8B53663A29A776B17D96FB51A4F3B2B62EEBA4A07F3A49A01B2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3770-5082","documentHash":"38b8604d-0bff-4113-ab70-c74438f2c9a1"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473ae947","name":"Robert","lastName":"Sika","uuid":"6987885A0393D3516B783915809F0F91CFB1E3E50F8BD69CEEDD59764A0F92F75B6C76BA077EA0C62E06EC783A02EB7A9514E38F6B999A0A4BE0A050DACCF06B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6025-5748","documentHash":"71cc9b6d-e550-491b-8899-3525eec9574e"},{"objectId":"5e7092f1878c28a04739fa4d","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Czarnecka-Komorowska","uuid":"80CD3EB83C010532DF6430B0466F5D42A95C3DB1CD20232D38979AF4C15F3A472128392E027128B26F4A0BB451139EFACCDD57DA36E8D523AFB96951F41F6B01","orcidId":"0000-0002-5027-7484","documentHash":"dba239c0-10ee-4bc3-96db-7da8a1eb5de4"},{"objectId":"5e7092f1878c28a04739fa4b","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Popielarski","uuid":"A447CEF4BAB1A644719BA9054F93BF39375D69EE7C5BB269B010C5027FBA2F90BBC2249573A7C8C4B8E7C4C9EFF235D122CB0465DA8F108D1B3D532C6A25F7A8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3797-5461","documentHash":"d68497ad-0148-44f9-994e-917aa6a55d05"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397224","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"GAWDZIŃSKA","uuid":"C6778D72E64A8693E71E8B4B3185176E02F27A2FBAC7C826FE10E52C1DE5C39FA8AF9E6CD9F255C1337381FDAC2C89900863455120FE2999A88DE6A876E35906","orcidId":"0000-0001-6989-6966","documentHash":"e6eca669-ec45-405e-9b6f-636b1b2cd1a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6502ace440970739aa37d67b","doi":"10.3390/ma16186106","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/18/6106","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Determination of Saturation Conditions of the Aluminum Metal Matrix Composites Reinforced with Al2O3 Sinter","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Aluminum metal matrix composites (Al MMCs) are a class of materials characterized by being light in weight and high hardness. Due to these properties, Al MMCs have various applications in the automobile, aeronautical and marine industries. Ceramic-reinforced Al MMCs in the form of sinters are known for having excellent abrasive properties, which makes them an attractive material in certain fields of technology. The biggest problem in their production process is their low ability to infiltrate ceramics with alloys and consequently the difficulty of filling a ceramic preform. The castability of such composites has not yet been researched in detail. The aim of this study was to create aluminum metal matrix composite castings based on aluminum alloys (AlSi11) reinforced with an Al2O3 sinter preform using a Castability Trials spiral mold, and then to determine the degree of saturation with the liquid metal of the produced ceramic shaped body (Castability Trials spiral). For the selected AlSi11 alloy, the liquidus (Tl) and solidus (Ts) temperatures were determined by performing thermal-derivation analysis during cooling, which is Tl—579.3 °C and Ts—573.9 °C. The resultant pressure necessary for the infiltration process was estimated for the reinforcement capillaries with the following dimensions: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 microns. The following values were used to determine the capillary pressure (Pk): surface tension of the alloy—σ = 840 mN/m; the extreme wetting angle of the reinforcement by the metal—θ = 136°. It has been experimentally confirmed that for the vacuum saturation process, the estimated resultant pressure enables saturation of reinforcement with capillaries larger than 25 microns, provided that the alloy temperature does not drop lower than the infiltration temperature. After the experiment, the time and route of the liquid metal flow in the spiral were determined. On the basis of the obtained values, a simulation was developed and initial assumptions such as saturation time, alloy temperature, reinforcement and mold temperature were verified. The energy balance showed that the saturation limit temperature was Tk = 580.7 °C for the reinforcement temperature of 575 °C. In contrast to the above, the assumption that the temperature of the metal after equalizing the temperature of the composite components must be higher than the liquidus temperature (Tliq = 579.3 °C) for the aluminum alloy used must be fulfilled. After the experiment, the time and path of the liquid metal flow in the spiral were determined. Then, on the basis of the obtained values, a simulation was developed, and the initial assumptions (saturation time and temperature) were verified."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f1878c28a04739fa4b","5e7092f1878c28a04739fa4d","5e7093a9878c28a0473ae958","5e7093a9878c28a0473ae947"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397224"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"6106-1 - 6106-16","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a9878c28a0473ae958","5e7092f1878c28a04739fa4b","5e7092f1878c28a04739fa4d","5e7093a9878c28a0473ae947","5e709284878c28a047397224"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65002bdb40970739aa2daed5","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"16","number":"18","documentHash":"d2b445e7-4ac7-41f4-adee-1280951b1211"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aluminum metal matrix composites","castability","energy balance","casting"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058891846"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a047397297","name":"JAN","lastName":"MONIETA","uuid":"5126CD6588EC51E96B1493D017947160A0937C6B4EC70C8F68E8206045627308F6C6407B4F63AB006B0B7E5470275189A0785A0CF022D45F1C643E8E323F3BBF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2992-5800","documentHash":"51e85aa9-9cbd-422f-9a89-b61a94515f35"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64e8576840970777ed7dd2bb","doi":"10.3390/app13179599","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/17/9599","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Diagnosing Cracks in the Injector Nozzles of Marine Internal Combustion Engines during Operation Using Vibration Symptoms","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the operation of internal combustion engines, despite technical state monitoring, some cracks that develop in metal components go undetected, leading to secondary, critical, or degradation damage. The diagnostic systems used in floating objects mainly use quasi-static thermodynamic signals, which alert operators too late about emerging damage. Although various methods have been developed to detect cracks in internal combustion engine components, the effectiveness and implementation of the proposed methods are not satisfactory. Therefore, this article presents the use of selected vibration and in-cylinder pressure signals to diagnose the development of damage in some components of marine diesel engines. The investigations were conducted under the natural conditions of the operation of sea-going vessels during port-handling operations. During these investigations, it was possible to observe clear changes in the values of diagnostic symptoms, which corresponded to the development of damage. The developing damage detected in the study involved cracks in injector nozzles manufactured from alloy steel. Despite advances in design, materials, and manufacturing technology, injector nozzle cracks still occur. The diagnostic symptoms used to detect damage development were the amplitude and spectral and wavelet measurements of vibration acceleration signals. This work aimed to search for crack-oriented methods of signal analysis, for example, computer visualization and the recording of diagnostic parameters in various domains. Decimation, windowed, time, amplitude, and time-frequency domain analyses; wavelet statistics; color analysis; and machine learning were used for classification using artificial neural networks. Experimental investigations showed the possibility of diagnosing the development processes of damage to marine diesel engines. The advanced signal processing methods used made it possible to obtain many signal measurements, from which the most useful diagnostic symptoms were selected. The new symptoms found with decimation, time-domain windowed analysis, and Haar wavelet statistics were more useful than the existing ones."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w

sustainable megapolises is associated with the formation of city multifloor manufacturing clusters (CMFMCs) in them directly in the residential area in order to reduce the supply chain from the manufacturer to consumers. Additive technologies (ATs) belong to green technologies because they are considered environmentally sustainable due to less production waste and the ability to reuse of product materials within the circular economy concept. Sustainable development of ATs and additive manufacturing management has become a priority sphere for scientific research, and the use of ATs in the city manufacturing has become any daily reality. Nevertheless, the issues of additive manufacturing management within the CMFMCs have not yet been sufficiently studied. The primary goal of this study was to examine the possibilities of additive manufacturing management in the CMFMCs of the megapolis due to the rational facilities multi-floor layout in production buildings, considering the structure of city manufacturing and business process reengineering related to the needs of the production services market. This paper presents a novel model of facilities multi-floor layout in the production buildings of the CMFMCs, considering the structure of city manufacturing, morphological analysis of the additive manufacturing equipment (AME) used, the balance of material and energy flows under infrastructure capacity limitations of megapolis. The model was verified based on a case study for various options of the floor-by-floor grouping of AME in a building of the CMFMCs. Management solutions for maintaining the flow balance of material, energy and water resources in the CMFMCs are discussed. The results may be useful for additive manufacturing management in an urban environment, taking into account the needs of the production services market in the megapolis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w

Each project partner was responsible for compiling two or three case studies, which have been assigned in the previous steps of the project, as well the teaching and evaluating method which was used during the Intensive Study Programs (ISP).

online sphere, new event paradigms must be explored and developed to better utilise the unique multimedia opportunities offered by the virtual world. With this in mind, we conducted in-depth interviews with researchers, performed a SWOT analysis of remote conferences, and developed experimental conference functionalities. We implemented these during the 9th edition of a two-day international scientific IT conference, which was attended by over 277 participants on the first day and 199 on the second. In this article, we describe how these innovative functionalities met the participants’ needs based on qualitative and quantitative data. We present how the experiences of remote and in-person events differ, and offer recommendations on organising remote conferences that encourage participants to exchange knowledge and engage in activities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737eec4","uid":"bV7b5PxMzYcN_S0F-CKP4Ow","uuid":"3467ab3b-6b6a-4c58-84bc-d41a4af88b72","name":"Ośrodek Przetwarzania Informacji — Państwowy

Methanol is a relatively new fuel, approved for use as a safe marine fuel in the late 2020s. In these analyses, reference was made to the current interim guidelines, supplementing the IGF Code in the form of MSC.1/Circ.1621. The SOV type was chosen because of the current growing demand for these ships (the dynamic development of offshore wind power) and the lack of analyses of this type of small craft. The importance of assessing CO2 emissions in this case is due to the specifics of the vessel’s operation in different modes, and thus the variable load on the propulsion system and the area of operation close to the coastline. A computational research method was used to evaluate CO2 emissions, as well as the cost of methanol fuel, using current regulations and technical data. A comparison was also made between conventional MDO and LNG fuels. The first results of the analysis showed that methanol fuel is only competitive with MDO (a few-percent advantage) in terms of the average estimated index value EIV. Economically, it will require a higher investment, despite the favourable unit price of methanol compared to LNG and MDO."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a3f9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"21","pagesFromTo":"7419","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a3f9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"653b4b0c409707677d744980","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"16","number":"21","documentHash":"958acc36-d9e7-4e0f-aeec-4ef6984792ee"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["alternative fuel","decarbonization","LNG","methanol","Service Operation Vessel (SOV)","EIV index"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059028551"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a5f80","name":"SYLWIA","lastName":"MIELNICZUK","uuid":"73A3B163A34553B8F9894C95EEBE66E994A8E49E47B3C7F5ECBA25EF32D50F394FD04A8EAA759930E4476EFF268B8EEF9E8244AF0618D2C8CAB38422FC4DD9C9","orcidId":"0000-0002-9568-5633","documentHash":"1c380b4c-ffbc-4c5f-ae5d-928c20446ecb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6565b0634097075e9e4dd518","doi":"10.17402/557","publicUri":"https://repository.am.szczecin.pl/handle/123456789/2768","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The modified artificial potential fields method in collision situations at sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper proposes a modified artificial potential fields (APF) method for collision avoidance at sea. The concept of artificial potentials used herein is derived from fields generated by electric charges. Attractive and repulsive forces are determined, accounting for the positions of an own vessel and a target vessel. The own vessel and its goal are considered as opposite charges. There is an attractive force between them, while the own vessel and target vessels or obstacles are considered as charges with a repulsive force between them. The values of these forces depend on the coefficients of attraction and repulsion. To solve a particular collision situation, the modified method of artificial potential fields is used. Due to the specific nature of the vessels’ movement, additional factors affecting the values of the attraction and repulsive forces are considered, as opposed to solutions used for robots. The main purpose of this article is to present the method for determining the coefficients of the APF method. This method will be used to avoid collisions at sea. From an analysis of factors influencing the execution of the vessel maneuver in a collision situation, a modified method for determining the attraction and repulsion coefficients is proposed. A case study of collision avoidance in a vessel encounter situation is also conducted."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709344878c28a0473a5f80"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"145","issue":"73","pagesFromTo":"73-81","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709344878c28a0473a5f80"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a6e6","mniswId":"18270","title":"Scientific Journals of the Maritime University of Szczecin-Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii Morskiej w Szczecinie","issn":"1733-8670","eissn":"2392-0378","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fdb820fa-cedd-41fe-95cd-b3a078aeeee6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64b665724097072492b1b244","year":"2023","volume":"73","number":"145","documentHash":"0faa54eb-dd81-42c8-9b0e-64da49d8bd11"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["artificial potential fields","safety","ship encounters","collision avoidance maneuvers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059028610"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6564875b4097075385073115","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Frank","documentHash":"4f7321be-3a68-4d3e-a749-3434eea92c02"},{"objectId":"5ebedcb4752340254fc422d7","name":"PRZEMYSŁAW","lastName":"BARTOSZKO","uuid":"393500104037CEC8A3A0306CCA77755B177CA1B4F042DA1D7BB84DB798D29E5B54E78F0182FA30DE9E55462AD7A7B5A87B7B516D6525453EA6382588C45C63C0","orcidId":"0000-0002-5289-5331","documentHash":"7531828a-58d4-4c71-ba93-53619b5e9192"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397253","name":"ARTUR","lastName":"BEJGER","uuid":"EB17316B5954E3CAFBD4F2412005CCE991BAE98A0EF070868AF3E5D9884806E950CD0BA57F64F794357B42DF1772A2B07DDDDD996E7D12C9B10089A3C61CB493","orcidId":"0000-0001-5392-1979","documentHash":"6e821e6d-f4ab-4b7c-aa75-398a2a6973d1"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397244","name":"JAN","lastName":"DRZEWIENIECKI","uuid":"F8B7912FFC9D0D6640FC6A737769EA9162C4AC8BBAF8472A996A844550348BA557488C629C5462974A14EDB24300E55A7BA80A357A556442FE8BABB521BE50B9","orcidId":"0000-0001-8758-8131","documentHash":"5063154c-9fc1-47e2-8aeb-456a33963407"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6564875b4097075385073114","doi":"10.3390/en16227474","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/22/7474","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Use of Coherence Functions of Acoustic Emission Signals as a Method for Diagnosing Wind Turbine Blades","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Acoustic emission (AE) is one of the methods of non-destructive evaluation (NDE), and functions by means of detecting elastic waves caused by dynamic movements in AE sources, such as cracking in various material structures. In the case of offshore wind turbines, the most vulnerable components are their blades. Therefore, the authors proposed a method using AE to diagnose wind turbine blades. In the identification of their condition during monitoring, it was noted that the changes characterising blade damage involve non-linear phenomena; hence, wave phenomena do not occur in the principal components of the amplitudes or their harmonics. When the authors used the inverse transformation in the signal analysis process, which essentially leads to finding a signal measure, it allowed them to distinguish the wave spectrum of an undamaged system from one in which the material structure of the blade was damaged. The characteristic frequencies of individual phenomena interacting with the blade of a working turbine provide the basis for the introduction of filters (or narrowband sensors) that will increase the quality of the diagnosis itself. Considering the above, the use of the coherence function was proposed as an important measure of a diagnostic signal, reflecting a given condition of the

transport. The 30-year forecast for the development of marine technologies predicts many autonomous vessels at sea. This will necessitate radical implementation of new intelligent maritime navigation systems. One of the intelligent systems that has to be implemented is a collision avoidance system. The inference process is a key element of autonomous manoeuvres. These authors propose an inference process that enables exchange of information, intentions and expectations between autonomous vessels and gives them an opportunity to negotiate a safe manoeuvre satisfying all the parties concerned. The model of inference in the communication process has been presented. Methods and algorithms for information exchange and negotiation have been developed. These models were implemented and tested under various conditions. The results of case studies indicate that it is possible to effectively communicate and negotiate used the developed method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented approach over 30 random simulations have been carried out. After successful laboratory tests, over 100 scenarios were executed in quasi-real conditions and fully operational conditions. Tests were carried out in the center of the Foundation for the Safety of Navigation and Environmental Protection on Lake Silm in Iława, Poland. In the framework of project AVAL (Autonomous Vessel with an Air Look) POIR.04.01.04-00-0025-16,  82 random scenarios involving four vessels were performed and 60 random scenarios with two vessels. In 2020 tests were carried out in real conditions on the ferries Wolin and m/f Gryf. The communication and negotiation system presented in the article has been designed and developed specially for maritime navigation purposes. The authors believe that the presented solution can be one of various solutions implemented in autonomous shipping in the near future."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972cb","5e709285878c28a0473972d2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"117-135","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972cb","5e709285878c28a0473972d2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479c48","mniswId":"21035","title":"Archives of Transport","doi":"","issn":"0866-9546","eissn":"2300-8830","documentHash":"63c104a5-52dc-41a7-91ff-a1f5e5250136"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6564486840970749a8dbe8bc","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"68","number":"4","documentHash":"5849e56e-8112-46a9-8347-fc713c520bb7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["automation of communication processes","autonomous ships","collision avoidance","inference processes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059088935"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972b7","name":"KRYSTIAN","lastName":"PIETRZAK","uuid":"CCDD5B57E059F066CEBEC0D4C29F31A3BD05AB6B08D620E03FFB70ABEAF8E4C28CCA3FF64116354F89B48EC121FAAE404C1FC7CE5480D4F2EC272F0358305D78","orcidId":"0000-0002-9145-4790","documentHash":"9309870e-6b16-4a3a-9d5e-e0e4e6f7f17c"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a047397289","name":"OLIWIA","lastName":"PIETRZAK","uuid":"DDB7BC0DA2FE5CE710B991416D0A29A2699AC571366F481AA5D8E1F52F93A48B38CAC078C4479BE79BF4C1E1585A5C6EDA6A1F6EA181A8164AEE49BB61F24A9B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4422-421X","documentHash":"6f4f7bc0-06ec-44b0-9d45-5886b025a6fb"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739727b","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"MONTWIŁŁ","uuid":"2347BDE1FD2C63FE562BD8F05553ABA734D0816BEEC42E5CBFD592BB2FD995DF248BDAD2A8BE94C055D282E0000050A5C116C34A9B9B2D3B32E20F1E9F3B960C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3721-868X","documentHash":"8216e071-7316-47e1-b696-4b74f6386619"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6572e3a04097074b377810ec","doi":"10.3390/en16247943","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/24/7943/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A Study on the Effects of Applying Cargo Delivery Systems to Support Energy Transition in Agglomeration Areas—An Example of the Szczecin Agglomeration, Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article addresses certain issues related to the application of various cargo delivery systems that facilitate energy transition in cities and agglomerations. The main purpose of this article was to estimate the effects resulting from the application of a cargo delivery system that is an alternative to road transport within the area of the Szczecin agglomeration. The study applied the following research methods: literature review, mathematical computations, case study, and observation. The article estimated the volume of transport external costs’ reduction resulting from shifting cargo deliveries from road to rail transport in said agglomeration, applying the EU methodology to specify the amounts of external costs generated by individual modes and means of transport. The completed studies have demonstrated that the application of a rail-based cargo delivery system in the Szczecin agglomeration would enable a considerable reduction in the external costs generated by transport, thus supporting energy transition in said area. The findings also make it possible to conclude that the proposed solution may bring some other effects, such as a reduction in the number of diesel-powered heavy goods vehicles, reduced road congestion, and the increased safety of residents, as well as supporting electromobility and low-emission mobility policies in cities and

The results of the conducted analyses show that part of the requirements set by the accreditation organizations running two of the most popular marina categorization schemes worldwide relate to the achievement of sustainable development goals. The requirements motivate the management at marinas applying for a category to implement solutions that are friendly to the environment and society, and contribute to the growth of local economies. The research results indicate that the categorization of marinas is not only of some marketing value but is also a useful tool in the development of sustainable marine tourism."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397272"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"76","issue":"148","pagesFromTo":"23-31","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397272"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a6e6","mniswId":"18270","title":"Scientific Journals of the Maritime University of Szczecin-Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii Morskiej w Szczecinie","issn":"1733-8670","eissn":"2392-0378","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fdb820fa-cedd-41fe-95cd-b3a078aeeee6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655dbaff40970728e32b02de","year":"2023","volume":"76","number":"148","documentHash":"000b9963-cf6f-453a-80a8-895f5df4b8a8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["management","sustainable development","sustainable tourism","marine tourism","categorization of tourist facilities","marinas management"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059118391"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"655db64240970728e32ad9dd","name":"Adriano","lastName":"Gurrieri","documentHash":"27884ebd-5592-477f-8303-9ef876fabd38"},{"objectId":"655db64240970728e32ad9dc","name":"Diana","lastName":"Datsenko","documentHash":"9489cf1c-11d4-4480-ace3-76ce6374bb73"},{"objectId":"655db64240970728e32ad9db","name":"Luca","lastName":"Persi","documentHash":"d858141d-b1c3-48cc-8394-30a9c434a93b"},{"objectId":"655db64240970728e32ad9da","name":"Olga","lastName":"Kunytska","documentHash":"a6edd197-533e-4ff4-8c03-4fd61f30f149"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972ad","name":"KINGA","lastName":"KIJEWSKA","uuid":"31BD0D9020883C3E16DB394B6D37321AC983F7A29ED320FF0DC7912B45CDAEB393A2DBA3B882F309A85A090419606C2F7F37142476B5776727B874670652DA1B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4980-9372","documentHash":"ed586d6b-78dc-446a-8146-6fc61bea1a37"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397203","name":"STANISŁAW","lastName":"IWAN","uuid":"F493D83A4967CDDC3DD6CAC0D263937EF19134C3A98DCBADBC71C2176DAFAF818DD157A33208F63C12260CAEEC6848D8CE3E15014DDE047F7A199750A3B87CDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-5480-5475","documentHash":"3c8e640e-f90a-4332-a130-9623e9c950b3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"655db64240970728e32ad9d9","doi":"10.17402/577","publicUri":"https://repository.am.szczecin.pl/handle/123456789/2791","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Comparative analysis of the parcel lockers market and its users in Italy, Poland, and Ukraine","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Parcel lockers seem to be a very interesting and innovative solution for any type of city, beneficial to both customers and online stores.

As part of the research, concepts for various dock moving systems have been developed, including calculations of technical and operational parameters. Each concept has been analysed for meeting the defined requirements and design criteria. Ultimately, a system which meets all of the requirements and criteria and is completely environmentally friendly has been selected for construction. The authors discuss the entire process of creating system concepts, parameter calculations, and assessment of fulfilment of the requirements and design criteria.

This project consists of three elements: a data repository, a rule base and a decision support system. Due to the schedule of works in the project, only the first of them was presented. The next ones will be described in subsequent publications at various international conferences. The idea of the project naturally resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, but other infectious outbreaks may also occur on sea vessels, posing a threat to the ship's crew and passengers (passenger transport). The existing legal regulations, available knowledge or training do not sufficiently address the problem of the epidemic on the state. Therefore, it was decided to introduce a novelty - a decision support system, which is designed to facilitate taking the right steps in the event of an infectious disease on a seagoing vessel."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397273","5e709284878c28a047397216","5f97ac52085dcb424e4c1b62","5e709284878c28a047397268"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"133-137","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397216","5f97ac52085dcb424e4c1b62","5e709284878c28a047397268","5e709284878c28a047397273","659d279740970776646ee6e7","659d279740970776646ee6e8","659d279740970776646ee6e9","659d279740970776646ee6ea","659d279740970776646ee6eb","659d279740970776646ee6ec","659d279740970776646ee6ed"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a614","mniswId":"19718","title":"TransNav - The International Journal on Marine Navigation and Safety of Sea Transportation","issn":"2083-6473","eissn":"2083-6481","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"ad4c92c6-41a5-43b8-ad64-4541e166e300"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659d221d40970776646e114b","year":"2024","volume":"18","number":"1","documentHash":"c7df538d-0c2d-4105-a2f4-0af1984aeede"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["decision support","decision support system","COVID-19","pandemic","seagoing ship"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059227505"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397268","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"LISAJ","uuid":"45193735E1766EF5D07F06E9066788B0E8EB2276921D491633322481134DF902C9A2EB07C8ADD53EF3D10D4198AAE0C305BBE634CE47AAC73A68634A8FDB6FF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-7390-425X","documentHash":"a71a51ed-c161-4647-b72f-097921dad8e6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"659d2fb94097077664707342","doi":"10.12716/1001.18.02.15","publicUri":"https://www.transnav.eu/Article_Model_of_Radio-Communications_Platform_Lisaj,70,1410.html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Model of Radio-Communications Platform Supporting Inland Navigation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents model of the Radio–communications Platform supporting Inland Navigation.

This particular manipulator stands as the most widely employed equipment on work class remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) globally. The article delves into a detailed discussion of ROVs in general, with a specific focus on those belonging to the work class category. Furthermore, the manipulator is dissected into its constituent elements, as delineated by the manufacturer, and each individual component is subjected to separate evaluation. The damages that were encountered are described in detail, along with the corresponding repair processes. To quantify the likelihood of future damage to the various manipulator elements over the subsequent five-year period, the obtained damage results are inputted into the Geogebra program. This enables the calculation of the probability of damage occurrence for each individual component. The research findings are ultimately summarized and juxtaposed with the real-life experiences of ROV operators, which are captured through a meticulously designed questionnaire. The questionnaire is carefully constructed to elicit valuable insights from the operators regarding the most common faults or defects observed in the Titan 4 manipulator. It is important to note that this manipulator-focused investigation is based on the author's first-hand experience as a ROV Supervisor in the offshore oil and gas industry. The combination of practical expertise and the empirical data gathered from the questionnaire responses ensures a comprehensive and well-rounded examination of the Titan 4 manipulator and its associated operational challenges."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"291","pagesFromTo":"116282","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659d43e54097077664727821","5e709285878c28a0473972c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c2","mniswId":"15344","title":"OCEAN ENGINEERING","issn":"0029-8018","documentHash":"516179a8-a9a7-44c4-a357-9eed3680be10"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659d43e54097077664727820","year":"2024","volume":"291","documentHash":"26bdd417-edd0-4e9d-ac9d-a4187c72fc28"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["offshore","ROV","robotics","manipulator","oil and gas","subsea","schilling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059231306"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659d35d340970776647130f6","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Krause","documentHash":"47ef11d4-af7d-44af-971f-ac8d13ca6b1f"},{"objectId":"659d35d340970776647130f5","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Kidacki","documentHash":"a1e35f96-6b3d-4a4e-8ad9-da0bae76ff5c"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739726b","name":"OLEH","lastName":"KLYUS","uuid":"A6125A6D7042694805585D228FF1E11710B26ABCEDE2484011D0B952D80C118EF0DB72DEF3A5165A412B59EE01656260D1DDEB45EA9931E127193648A3F8D6A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-9849-5974","documentHash":"ab147927-87b8-491c-a616-48178c5528b2"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b94","name":"SŁAWOMIR","lastName":"OLSZOWSKI","uuid":"C4FDB3FF9B965680B53584EDA2C56E32980853DF560DD0959D31F5AE7F8AB1C435B63B4DD9A8EEA4C4F063677373E5D3D9EBB2FF65F1BBD183229AA9891D8937","orcidId":"0000-0001-5991-9124","documentHash":"71ebd812-1581-4e49-998e-87c9e4606165"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"659d35d340970776647130f4","doi":"10.3390/en17010266","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/1/266/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The Effect of Internal Combustion Engine Nozzle Needle Profile on Fuel Atomization Quality","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article presents the results of research on the impact of changing the cross-section of an atomizer’s flow channel, which is caused by changing the flow geometry of the passive part of the needle on the drop diameter distribution of the fuel spray. A three-hole type H1LMK, 148/1 atomizer with hole diameters, dN, equal to 0.34 mm, is analyzed. A nozzle with a standard (i.e., unmodified) needle and three nozzles using needles with a modified profile in the flow part of the needle, marked by the code signatures 1L, 2L, and 3L, are tested. An increasing level of fuel turbulence characterizes the needles during the flow along their flow part due to the use of one (1L), two (2L), and three (3L) de Laval toroidal nozzles, respectively, obtained by mechanically shaping the outer surface of the flow part of the spray needle. The spray produced is tested using the Malvern Spraytec STP 500 device cooperating with the dedicated Malvern version 4.0. During the tests, measurements and an analysis of the spray droplet size distribution over the entire injection duration, equal to 7 ± 2 ms, are made for each nozzle. The experiment makes it possible to determine the effect of the nozzle needles’ profiles on the time distribution of the actual droplet diameters; the time distribution of the Sauter mean droplet diameters, D[3,2]; the percentile shares of the droplet diameters Dv (10), Dv (50), and Dv (90); the distribution span during the development of the spray stream; and the time distribution of the shares of the droplets with diameters belonging to selected diameter classes D[x1−x2] in the spray. The results of the measurements of the drop diameter distribution indicate that using atomizers with a modification to the flow channel allows for an increase in the share of droplets with smaller diameters compared to the standard atomizer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a04739726b","5e709285878c28a0473972c8","5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

The new polymer biocomposites (WPCs) were evaluated for their mechanical and structural properties regarding their susceptibility to multiple processing. As thermo-mechanical degradation processes are associated with the repeated processing of plastics, which causes changes in the properties and structure of these materials. Therefore, to determine the extent to which the composites can be used under operating conditions, the composites were examined by DMA. As a result of the study observed some effects caused by the repeated effects of shear stress and temperature on the rheological and mechanical properties of polymer composites. The first of these is related to a decrease in viscosity of WPC composites subjected to the six times processing and changes in flow conditions during extrusion and injection moulding due to the degradation of the polypropylene matrix. As the viscosity of the composites decreased, a reduction in tensile strength and other mechanical properties of the polypropylene matrix was noted. On the other hand, the second effect observed leads to the conclusion that, as the composites' processing cycles increase, the WPC composite's mechanical properties increase due to an increase in the degree of homogenization of the individual components of the WPC composition. This study aims to describe the relationship between these two primary processes and to determine the relationship between the properties and the structure of the new WPCs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397224"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a9a2"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"207","pagesFromTo":"117710","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659d456c4097077664729464","659d456c4097077664729465","659d456c4097077664729466","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9a2","5e709284878c28a047397224","659d456c4097077664729468"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780a6","mniswId":"8251","title":"Industrial Crops and Products","issn":"0926-6690","eissn":"0926-6690","documentHash":"d6fc1395-6854-49a3-a8b6-440ec66188ee"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659d456c4097077664729463","year":"2024","volume":"207","documentHash":"71115cc7-ea2c-4839-967b-eea21626a4b3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["recycling","structure","Wood-polymer composites","Thermo-mechanical properties","Processing conditions"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059238146"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65aa5f8e409707102e8b72bd","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Banaszek","documentHash":"e6fd935f-ec4d-40d2-a510-d106b7cbfda6"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397268","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"LISAJ","uuid":"45193735E1766EF5D07F06E9066788B0E8EB2276921D491633322481134DF902C9A2EB07C8ADD53EF3D10D4198AAE0C305BBE634CE47AAC73A68634A8FDB6FF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-7390-425X","documentHash":"a71a51ed-c161-4647-b72f-097921dad8e6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-12-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"65aa5f8e409707102e8b72bc","doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2023.10.063","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1877050923012218?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Radiocommunication Support Decision System to Use in Distress Situations for Captains of Small Non-conventional Vessels Operating in the Caribbean Sea Area","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents the concept of a Radio Communication System to support the decision of the captain of a small non-conventional vessel including a yacht sailing in the waters of the Caribbean Sea in a dangerous situation requiring a call for RCC assistance. This is important to enhance boating safety in the area, where, due to the reduced and non-overlapping accessible areas of the A1 and A2 communications zones, calling for RCC assistance using common VHF/MF radio equipment is limited. In the event of danger to life and property on a yacht, the ability to contact Marine Rescue Centers is a primary concern. This paper presents a model of an intelligent system for supporting the captain in making the right navigation decision, in a dangerous situation, based on the method of artificial neural networks ANN. The article presents an example of numerical simulation of operation of the discussed system of Radio Communication decision support, assuming a specific position of the small non-conventional vessel in distress, with reference to the existing communication areas A1, A2 in the Caribbean Sea. The result of the simulation is related to the calculation of the distance to the nearest zone, enabling the establishment of communication with the marine Rescue Center to distress call, the value of the new corrected course of the small non-conventional vessel and the time of arrival at the above-mentioned zone."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397268"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"225","pagesFromTo":"765-774","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574195a","mniswId":"1113","fullName":"International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems","shortName":"KES","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"bb65bc19-2aab-4b61-9a0e-d6b41e5b1e74"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"65a993e84097071977e1470b","startDate":"2023-09-06","endDate":"2023-09-08","fullName":"27th International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems","shortName":"KES 2023","city":"Athens","country":"GR","website":"http://kes2023.kesinternational.org/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"a89e6b92-ec51-461b-82aa-1861d7b269b5"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65aa5f8e409707102e8b72bd","5e709284878c28a047397268"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e710e5046e0fb0001bb6a1d","title":"Procedia Computer Science","eissn":"1877-0509","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/procedia-computer-science/","documentHash":"3c8e416f-2852-455f-83a1-3b8733fb1938"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6575454e4097075d9874d6af","year":"2023","volume":"225","documentHash":"f302aa28-1249-4958-8781-ccd675e39352"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["yacht","neural network computer system","support decision system","radio communication systems","distress situation","RCC","Caribbean Sea","small non-conventional vessel"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059258754"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397224","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"GAWDZIŃSKA","uuid":"C6778D72E64A8693E71E8B4B3185176E02F27A2FBAC7C826FE10E52C1DE5C39FA8AF9E6CD9F255C1337381FDAC2C89900863455120FE2999A88DE6A876E35906","orcidId":"0000-0001-6989-6966","documentHash":"e6eca669-ec45-405e-9b6f-636b1b2cd1a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"65aa712a409707102e8d08af","doi":"10.3390/en17020444","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/2/444","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Arrhenius Equation for Calculating Viscosity in Assessing the Dilution Level of Lubricating Oil with Diesel Oil—A Case Study of SAE 30 and SAE 40 Grade Marine Lubricating Oils","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article proposes using the Arrhenius model for estimating the viscosity of a mixture of two liquids in the quantitative assessment of the physicochemical properties of lubricating oils in the context of assessing the level of dilution of lubricating oil with diesel oil. Dynamic are made of mixtures of lubricating oil and diesel oil with known concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100% m/m of the diesel oil content in the mixture. Mixtures of the most popular oils (viscosity classes SAE 30 and SAE 40) with diesel oil that meet the requirements of the DMX of the marine distillate fuels category are prepared and tested. Viscosity measurements are performed at 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 °C temperatures. The Arrhenius model is used to estimate the viscosity of the mixtures with an assumed diesel oil content and to estimate the diesel oil concentration in the mixtures with a known measured viscosity value. In both cases, the absolute estimation error is determined, and the accuracy of the estimation is assessed against the known concentration of diesel oil in the mixture with lubricating oil and the temperature at which the viscosity is measured. The estimated concentrations of diesel oil in mixtures with lubricating oil are useful to assess the condition of the lubricating oil (for concentrations of diesel oil lower than 5% m/m). The method is proposed to be used in practice to support standard laboratory oil analysis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c8","5e709284878c28a047397224","5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"444","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245","5e709285878c28a0473972c8","5e709284878c28a047397224"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659e540d4097077f7b4ebe46","year":"2024","volume":"17","number":"2","documentHash":"9964d0a9-5b09-4b87-b12f-70c49edaffe1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["marine diesel engine","diesel oil","lubricating oil properties","fuel dilution","dynamic viscosity","mixture viscosity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059259428"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65ae7259409707287bf2bb42","name":"J.","lastName":"Smoliński","documentHash":"170e075c-5620-4926-aa31-194bd92a44ec"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473a9f16","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"FRANCISZCZAK","uuid":"99B15E0E3033A8906EDB41A0F3FD71EF0C7B7BEF04ADEA305715C1A2D4F3DAC62DC59671D6743212A0446434C520EDB1B08C414E8678791C531B581454713F67","orcidId":"0000-0002-4618-7048","documentHash":"f6dc276b-0221-47c5-bcb2-265c2d13edf2"}],"objectId":"65ae7259409707287bf2bb40","doi":"10.1016/j.compstruct.2023.117450","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0263822323007961?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Hybrid all-cellulose reinforcement in polypropylene matrix biocomposites for injection moulding - influence of particle geometry and volume fraction on hybrid effect","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The presented study is focused on evaluation of influence of reinforcement volume fraction and geometry on the occurrence of positive hybrid effect by the hybridisation of man-made cellulose fibres (rayon viscose) with cellulose microparticle fillers applied in polypropylene matrix.

More ports are implementing digital twin systems, which provide a complete 3D reconstruction of the port as well as real-time data on all objects and actions in progress. It is challenging to provide all relevant data in a way that improves situational awareness and decision-making, resulting in improved management and a faster, more effective response during an emergency. This is due to greater port areas and drones operating in the air, on the water's surface, and underneath. To solve this issue, the PASSport initiative, a project financed by the European Space Agency (EUSPA), is developing an innovative solution based on Mixed Reality (MR) technology. The solution combines real-time geo-tagged and Earth Observation data to provide end users with enhanced 3D representation of the port area via a dedicated Head Mounted Display (HMD) that records user location and movement."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709224878c28a047390892","5e709284878c28a047397220","5e709284878c28a047397247","5e709295878c28a047398776"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"127-132","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397247","5e709295878c28a047398776","5e709284878c28a047397220","5e709224878c28a047390892","659d221d40970776646e114c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a614","mniswId":"19718","title":"TransNav-International Journal on Marine Navigation and Safety of Sea Transportation","issn":"2083-6473","eissn":"2083-6481","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"c704bad0-e11d-4322-a4aa-17b2b21817f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659d221d40970776646e114b","year":"2024","volume":"18","number":"1","documentHash":"c7df538d-0c2d-4105-a2f4-0af1984aeede"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["decision making process","digital twin system","Head Mounted Display (HMD)","unmanned aerial system (UAS)","European Space Agency (EUSPA)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059276786"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65aa551d409707102e8a87a3","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Jaszczak","documentHash":"bb0bc0d9-7a42-4fce-b1ce-139c9737c386"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972d6","name":"ZENON","lastName":"ZWIERZEWICZ","uuid":"D11FC13924634ACE5F202063AC257FA946D6A37D6F74721A65C442D3C5C821CCA099AF784392F63C0B2D1A4C31BDFFE7D8E17D497F758EEF6A7CAB2265110411","orcidId":"0000-0002-0098-3671","documentHash":"2909c08a-4a50-4f80-a209-d0f340ed2251"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739722d","name":"LECH","lastName":"DOROBCZYŃSKI","uuid":"C288151E46DB81947D7A8C31B905BC563750794556E56A43E4ACF1C623ADE8A5D7DACF8CB564F2BF341AAB62B4732C2E2AE86FEF20E3F1872FA8DF25A3DC4B41","orcidId":"0000-0001-8388-8700","documentHash":"37c0d642-f93b-40a4-94f1-fc71b0a3a24e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-12-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"65aa551d409707102e8a87a2","doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2023.10.465","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S187705092301623X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Designing an optimal ship course-keeping system for an unknown object model via adaptive dynamic programming approach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper discusses the problem of ship autopilot design based on the adaptive (approximate) dynamic programming approach (ADP).

The technical condition of the internal combustion engine and injection apparatus significantly determines the composition of the outlet gases. For this purpose, an analytical package using modern technology assigns experimental test scores to appropriate classes. The graded changes in the value of diagnostic parameters were measured on the injection subsystem bench outside the engine. The influence of the operating conditions of the fuel injection subsystem and injector condition features on the injector needle vibration displacement waveforms was subjected to a neural network (NN) ML process and then tested. Diagnostic parameters analyzed in the amplitude, frequency, and time–frequency domains were subjected after a learning process to recognize simulated various regulatory and technical states of suitability and unfitness with single and complex damage of new and worn injector nozzles. Classification results were satisfactory in testing single damage and multiple changes in technical state characteristics for unfitness states with random wear injectors. Testing quality reached above 90% using selected NNs of Statistica 13.3 and MATLAB R2022a environments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a047397297","5e709284878c28a047397221"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"6898","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a047397297","5e709284878c28a047397221"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":"10.3390/en","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"073c6b4f-b994-4710-8065-02d74e1e73ce"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"651675b24097072090cb7925","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"19","documentHash":"0736e616-2aeb-495b-8615-35fc25eb0d61"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["marine engines","injectors","experimental states","machine learning","state classification"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059286690"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65ae61de409707287bf19756","name":"Antoni","lastName":"Jaszcz","documentHash":"77d576dd-f70f-4744-ad80-5ce9f883e01a"},{"objectId":"65ae61de409707287bf19755","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Połap","documentHash":"c51ef9ea-8451-43d9-9057-4aa82519bf01"},{"objectId":"65ae61de409707287bf19754","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Prokop","documentHash":"5f7bc6a6-ef29-4a5a-ab30-73b3d4b3c28b"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c4","name":"MARTA","lastName":"WŁODARCZYK-SIELICKA","uuid":"E2672257D6548CB96A156323A538F169F850F21A9FCDF2CCE6C1D494DF5C18285AB32B3B9087F4704502FEE31B5D7C1D165D35505CD85ED9DCF844B04A45FD6D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7489-8437","documentHash":"e1658e70-952e-4244-bb79-494498fb1350"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"65ae61de409707287bf19753","doi":"10.3389/fenvs.2023.1303067","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1303067/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"End-to-end system for monitoring the state of rivers using a drone","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Automatic data analysis systems in the Internet of Things are a key element. One such case is the use of drones to monitor rivers, which are quite often located around built-up areas. This is an important element for the analysis of urban areas that are exposed to various environmental challenges such as pollution and animal habitats. Data analysis allows the detection of anomalies in the state of rivers, reducing the risk of ecological disasters or even floods. Additionally, constant control of areas enables analysis of the impact of urbanization on a given area as well as environmental protection. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end system, where the user performs measurements with a drone and the result is a segmentation mask from the U-Net network, but improved by image processing algorithms. The system is based on performing segmentation with a neural network, imposing the obtained mask on the image that was previously subjected to edge detection. All pixels under the mask are analyzed by the clustering method in terms of belonging to a river or bank. In addition, when there are other measurements from the same area, they are used to compare and analyze changes. The proposed system architecture is based on the automation of activities due to the combination of various graphics processing methods. Moreover, the method allows for obtaining more accurate segmentation results than classic methods. The proposition was tested on data gathered near river areas in southern Poland to show the possibilities and effectiveness of the system. Proposed methodology reached 0.8524 of Dice coefficient using VGG16 as encoder."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1303067","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65ae61de409707287bf19754","65ae61de409707287bf19755","5e709285878c28a0473972c4","65ae61de409707287bf19756"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb0","mniswId":"22507","title":"Frontiers in Environmental Science","issn":"2296-665X","eissn":"2296-665X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"bbb857d0-f84b-43a1-838e-2a780d6ab4ed"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"642698694097071b41d97674","year":"2023","volume":"11","documentHash":"a33572fa-c158-4cb0-a748-ddb8703b75d3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["data fusion","image processing","neural networks","remote sensing","river monitoring system","monitoring system","spatial maps","coastal zones"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059286870"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709302878c28a0473a105b","name":"ROMA","lastName":"STRULAK-WÓJCIKIEWICZ","uuid":"8C92AA1B80A0E1A8B33038D2BFA2853743E2459C2E07660458E502680B6FD312E49940536498018058F202263B6B3C4E56C1CE6422308191A4733D2334E5AC6A","orcidId":"0000-0002-9702-7554","documentHash":"74fdf136-6273-46ff-b941-dd2193ebe09f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-12-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"65aa52d7409707102e8a5a1b","doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2023.10.457","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050923016150","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Analysis of computer-aided tools for the freight transport options on selected examples","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article discusses issues related to the use of computer aided tools for the selection of transport options in the transport of goods.

To date, such a solid solution has been obtained and characterized to a limited extent, but only for a few selected compositions. This solution was obtained by a high temperature and, for the first time, using mechanochemical methods. For the solution obtained by the high-energy ball-milling method, unknown physicochemical properties were established over its entire range of homogeneity. The solution was synthesized from mixtures of yttrium orthovanadate (V) with ytterbium (III) orthovanadate (V) of different compositions and investigated by XRD, IR, SEM, and UV-Vis(DRS) methods. It was found that Y1−xYbxVO4 crystallizes in a tetragonal system. The results confirmed that the solid solution Y1−xYbxVO4 has a structure of YVO4 and YbVO4, and its structure is composed of YbO6 and YO6 octahedrons and VO4 tetrahedrons. Moreover, if the parameter (x) in the solid solution Y1−xYbxVO4 increases, its crystalline lattice contracts and the value of the energy gap decreases.

The position of the cavitation cloud and its volume in the cavitation tunnel, determined by numerical analysis with respect to the inlet velocity, allows for the determination of the lower or higher intensity of cavitation erosion within the tunnel of the sample material. A numerical analysis is carried out on a model of a typical cavitation tunnel used to investigate the resistance of structural materials to cavitation erosion. The tunnel under study consists of barricade (upper) and counter-barricade (lower) systems. The numerical analysis is carried out with the following five different values of the velocity in the tunnel inlet: 6 m/s, 9 m/s, 12 m/s, 15 m/s, and 18 m/s in the commercial CFD software – Ansys Fluent 2019 R3. The Schnerr and Sauer cavitation model and shear stress transport (SST) viscous model k-omega are used. The paper analyzes the distribution of velocity, pressure, and volume of the cavitation cloud. On the basis of the performed numerical analyses, the optimal velocity at the inlet to the tunnel of 15 m/s is determined, for which the volume of the cavitation cloud is the largest and the phenomenon of cavitation is the most intense. The determination of the position and maximum volume of the cavitation cloud relative to the inlet velocity to the tunnel will, in future, allow us to shorten the resistance tests for cavitation erosion of different materials under real fluid flow conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972af","5e709284878c28a04739723f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"76","issue":"148","pagesFromTo":"48-56","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a04739723f","5e709285878c28a0473972af"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a6e6","mniswId":"18270","title":"Scientific Journals of the Maritime University of Szczecin-Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii Morskiej w Szczecinie","issn":"1733-8670","eissn":"2392-0378","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fdb820fa-cedd-41fe-95cd-b3a078aeeee6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655dbaff40970728e32b02de","year":"2023","volume":"76","number":"148","documentHash":"000b9963-cf6f-453a-80a8-895f5df4b8a8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cavitation","cavitation erosion","CFD simulations","computational fluid dynamics (CFD)","multiphase flows","multiphase flow models","cavitation model"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059314033"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65ae6af0409707287bf23e23","name":"JET","lastName":"Contributors","documentHash":"6bc63bfa-3e03-4f29-9802-d208ce71c770"},{"objectId":"65ae6af0409707287bf23e22","name":"the JOREK","lastName":"team","documentHash":"5ad38314-37d5-4543-aac8-b2824afd92ee"},{"objectId":"65ae6af0409707287bf23e21","name":"S.","lastName":"Sadouni","documentHash":"b99485b0-d42f-46ac-ab8b-31fa2da11cdc"},{"objectId":"65ae6af0409707287bf23e20","name":"F.J.","lastName":"Artola","documentHash":"fb74eeb3-cf1f-4e6a-a8d1-406369d767ad"},{"objectId":"65ae6af0409707287bf23e1f","name":"K.","lastName":"Särkimäki","documentHash":"9f508d00-5996-4549-b22f-4d2e33dc4d7c"},{"objectId":"65ae6af0409707287bf23e1e","name":"E.","lastName":"Nardon","documentHash":"71ff65fc-0b5e-4a0e-9c57-bd67840c6011"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397202","name":"BOHDAN","lastName":"BIEG","uuid":"824102936597EAEAFDC0CA005121E68A31F5CD249313BB3DE7A696711B7AF50AA39660B4406408C7C6F1876B2B4C60A29C04488145A12D92F4454003EDE7904F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3649-6349","documentHash":"4211ff14-2499-4712-b9b5-bf009f77c090"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-30","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"65ae6af0409707287bf23e1d","doi":"10.1088/1741-4326/acc417","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/acc417","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"On the origin of the plasma current spike during a tokamak disruption and its relation with magnetic stochasticity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A JOREK 3D non-linear MHD simulation of a disruption triggered by an argon massive gas injection in JET, which quantitatively reproduces the plasma current ( Ip f ) profile relaxation which appears to result from Shear Alfven Wave (SAW) propagation along stochastic field lines, as proposed by Boozer (2019 Plasma Phys.

For this reason, the International Maritime Organization introduced an amendment to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, requiring the verification of container weight declared in the transport document. It partially solved the problem of accurate determination of container ship stability, although an error of 5% by weight is accepted. In this study, using the Macs3 program, the weight of 100 containers was changed by 5% to assess how such a situation affects the ship’s stability. It was found that even a slight change in the weight can affect stability. There are other problems that have to be addressed, e.g., loading of the containers as per positions in the loading plan or sharing information about mass distribution inside.

W związku z rozbieżnymi opiniami w literaturze naukowej dotyczącymi wpływu lub braku wpływu rozcieńczenia oleju smarowego olejem napędowym na ryzyko eksplozji w skrzyni korbowej, postawiona została hipoteza, że olej napędowy stanowiący zanieczyszczenie oleju smarowego zwiększa ryzyko powstania eksplozji w skrzyni korbowej bezwodzikowego silnika spalinowego w związku z niezależnym oddziaływaniem szeregu czynników, takich jak: (1) pogorszenie względem czystego oleju właściwości smarnościowych oleju rozcieńczonego paliwem, (2) zwiększenie względem czystego oleju lotności i poprawa właściwości zapłonowych oleju rozcieńczonego paliwem, (3) zwiększenie względem czystego oleju udziału kropel o najmniejszych średnicach we mgle olejowej wytworzonej z oleju rozcieńczonego. W celu weryfikacji hipotezy zrealizowano wieloelementowy plan badawczy mający na celu wszechstronne opisanie wpływu rozcieńczenia oleju smarowego olejem napędowym na powstawanie gorących miejsc w skrzyni korbowej, które są elementem koniecznym do zainicjowania procesu tworzenia wybuchowej (białej) mgły olejowej w skrzyni korbowej oraz dla inicjacji zapłonu mieszaniny palnej. Badaniom poddano mieszaniny oleju smarowego z olejem napędowym w różnym stężeniu oleju smarowego w mieszaninie (0%, 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 75% i 100% wag.). Jako oleje smarowe do wytworzenia tych mieszanin wykorzystano dwa najpowszechniejsze w okrętowych instalacjach smarowania obiegowego silników bezwodzikowych jednogatunkowe oleje smarowe należące do klas lepkościowych SAE 30 i SAE 40. Jako olej napędowy wybrano paliwo spełniające wymagania kategorii dla paliw żeglugowych DMX. Dla pełnego zakresu stężeń oleju napędowego w badanych olejach smarowych określono właściwości reologiczne, tribologiczne i zapłonowe tych 164 mieszanin. Dodatkowo badaniu poddano mgłę olejową wygenerowaną mechanicznie z mieszanin 0%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 50% i 100% wag. oleju napędowego w oleju smarowym należącym do klasy lepkościowej SAE 40. Określono charakterystykę morfologiczną kropel mgły olejowej, w tym przepuszczalność światła, rozkład wielkości kropel, wybrane średnice percentylowe kropel, wybrane średnie średnice ważone kropel oraz udział procentowy kropel o średnicach istotnych dla powstania białej mgły olejowej (≤ 5 μm), odpowiedzialnej za eksplozje w skrzyniach korbowych silników spalinowych. Dla określonych poszczególnych parametrów fizykochemicznych mieszanin oraz wskaźników opisujących charakterystykę morfologiczną mgły olejowej dokonano oceny zmienności tych wielkości oraz przeanalizowano korelację pomiędzy poszczególnymi wartościami a poziomem rozcieńczenia oleju smarowego olejem napędowym. Wyciągnięto szereg wniosków, a przeprowadzone badania potwierdziły istnienie szeregu związków między rosnącym poziomem rozcieńczenia oleju smarowego olejem napędowym a czynnikami wpływającymi na zwiększenie ryzyka wystąpienia eksplozji w skrzyni korbowej, takimi jak intensyfikacja zacierania się współpracujących elementów (wzrost sił tarcia w parach tribologicznych), szybsze odparowywanie oleju (zwiększenie lotności, obniżenie temperatury zapłonu oleju) czy intensyfikacja tworzenia się kropel mgły olejowej o najmniejszych średnicach kropel (zwiększenie liczby kropel i zmniejszenie ich średnic). Uzyskane wyniki badań potwierdziły prawdziwość postawionej hipotezy badawczej."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"978-83-64434-56-3","pages":166,"translation":false,"publicationPlace":"Szczecin","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb778","mniswId":"11300","name":"Akademia Morska w Szczecinie","documentHash":"cd457f72-563e-49a6-9a9b-0d70cbc60ea5"},"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["silnik okrętowy","skrzynia korbowa","eksplozja","pożar","olej smarowy","olej napędowy","rozcieńczenie","silnik bezwodzikowy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059373229"},{"authors":[],"objectId":"65ccc3874097073ccbc98b2e","doi":"10.3390/books978-3-0365-6675-7","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/books978-3-0365-6675-7","type":"EDITED_BOOK","typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","year":2023,"title":"Advances in Remote Sensing of the Inland and Coastal Water Zones","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This reprint covers works related to research on the environments of coastal zones and inland waters, solving complex and current scientific problems in these areas.

Some works propose new possibilities of using geospatial data or methods of remote sensing data processing. They include issues related to the use of augmented and virtual reality, object-oriented image analysis, UAV-based photogrammetry, fusion of hydroacoustic and photogrammetric data, spatial interpolation, and geodata reduction techniques. These methods are being developed to support safe navigation in inland waters; low-cost monitoring of underwater objects; creating bathymetric maps and topobathymetric digital models or mapping submerged aquatic vegetation. The papers also focus on improving existing solutions and demonstrate new research approaches, including atmospheric correction, adjacency effects for remotely sensed images, classification of wetland vegetation, as well as determining the speed of sound in shallow waters for hydrography applications. These papers demonstrate the potential of the information contained in the remote sensing data acquired by the various platforms, as well as techniques for image processing based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c4","5e709285878c28a0473972b2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"EDITOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972b2","65ccc3874097073ccbc98b2f","65ccc3874097073ccbc98b30","5e709285878c28a0473972c4"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"9783036566757","translation":false,"publicationPlace":"Basel, Switzerland","publisher":{"objectId":"5ec0106ead49b31ccee0d36b","name":"MDPI","documentHash":"6c88b616-3a6d-4479-839c-95dd324ab8ba"},"editors":[{"objectId":"65ccc3874097073ccbc98b30","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Bradtke","documentHash":"64839a78-cafb-4a26-8309-b0f2cf3e2506"},{"objectId":"65ccc3874097073ccbc98b2f","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Terefenko","documentHash":"b2c9d06e-a07d-4251-a907-591663075235"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c4","name":"MARTA","lastName":"WŁODARCZYK-SIELICKA","uuid":"E2672257D6548CB96A156323A538F169F850F21A9FCDF2CCE6C1D494DF5C18285AB32B3B9087F4704502FEE31B5D7C1D165D35505CD85ED9DCF844B04A45FD6D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7489-8437","documentHash":"e1658e70-952e-4244-bb79-494498fb1350"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972b2","name":"JACEK","lastName":"ŁUBCZONEK","uuid":"AD046A6DC6AD0360FA497F1276FACC696152E88FA249762E73BFF66BF8CA4A9675182095BB40C89D06F24BDE076116BE8DB7731D37C556684AEB32294110881D","orcidId":"0000-0002-9400-3426","documentHash":"7ad31af0-22d5-45fa-99ab-9e8a0a1513e5"}],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bathymetry","remote sensing","unmanned vehicles","coastal zones","inland water","geodata processing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059377013"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65cf31934097075ea841e6f7","name":"DOROTA","lastName":"CHYBOWSKA","documentHash":"83105eb4-40f6-4ede-804e-a17bdbc537e2"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"}],"objectId":"65cf31934097075ea841e6f6","publicUri":"https://wydawnictwo.akademia.kalisz.pl/sprawnosc-wspoldzialania-podmiotow-w-zarzadzaniu-kryzysowym/","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Ocena istotności zdarzeń pierwotnych związanych z działaniami dywersyjnymi przeciwko infrastrukturze krytycznej","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W niniejszym rozdziale dokonano wprowadzenia do metody drzew ataku służącej do modelowania działań dywersyjnych przeciwko obiektom klasyfikowanym jako infrastruktura krytyczna.

The history and basics of modeling with the use of attack tree analysis are presented. This tool can be used to assess the course of cause-effect chains and probabilistic analysis of adverse events such as catastrophes and serious industrial failures in the context of machine and device failures, operator mistakes, environmental impact, software errors and intentional actions such as industrial sabotage, cyber-attacks, forceful seizure of a facility, etc. The method can be used to determine the probability of an undesirable event such as a major industrial failure or catastrophe. The chapter presents a proposal of the application of reliability measures of significance (importance) to assess the impact of selected factors on the occurrence of the analyzed undesirable situation. The chapter presents definitions of selected measures adjusted to their use in relation to the attack tree. An analysis of the importance of events in hypothetical activities aimed at stealing from the archive documentation of an industrial facility classified as critical infrastructure was carried out. An exemplary model in the form of an attack tree was presented for which a qualitative and quantitative analysis were performed, including the determination of the minimum failure sections (minimum sets of events ensuring the occurrence of a top event), the probability of a top event and measures of importance for the modeled primary events. Birnbaum’s measure of reliability importance, Birnbaum's measure of structural importance, Vesely-Fussell's measure of importance and Criticality (Lambert’s) measure of importance were calculated.

Bezpieczeństwo nawigacji jest stanem systemu inżynierii ruchu morskiego związanym z bezwypadkowym przeprowadzeniem statku zgodnie z celem jego podróży i zachowaniem wymaganych parametrów ruchu. Bezpieczeństwo nawigacji na akwenach portowych jest podstawowym ograniczeniem budowy i rozbudowy portów oraz wzrostu wielkości i liczby eksploatowanych tam statków. Port jest systemem składającym się z różnego rodzaju portowych dróg wodnych takich jak kotwicowisko, zewnętrzne i wewnętrzne tory wodne, obrotnice i baseny portowe. Warunki bezpiecznej eksploatacji statków w porcie jako systemie składającym się z różnego rodzaju dróg wodnych zależą od warunków bezpiecznej eksploatacji statków na poszczególnych drogach wodnych wchodzących w jego skład. Każda morska droga wodna posiada ograniczenia ruchu statków z niej korzystających. Ograniczenia te nazywane są warunkami bezpiecznej eksploatacji morskiej drogi wodnej lub warunkami bezpiecznej eksploatacji statków na morskiej drodze. Niniejszy tekst powstał na podstawie wyników badań prowadzonych przez członków zespołu badawczego inżynierii ruchu morskiego na Wydziale Nawigacyjnym Politechniki Morskiej w Szczecinie oraz na podstawie wyników prowadzonych na świecie współczesnych badań naukowych z tego zakresu.

These codends were firstly tested at sea by single trawls and compared to T90 and herring codend trawls, allowing assessment of caught fish mass and dimensions. Additionally, a special divided small-mesh coat for the innovative codends enabled determination of the amount as well as the length and mass of cod escaping from the codend both while the trawling gear was towed and while it was hauled. Further validation of codend selectivity was carried out by a double (twin) bottom trawl set deployed from one cutter in various variants of innovative codends compared to standard ones. The results of the study indicate that the use of an innovative ultracross codend and innovative devices reducing the water flow speed (tarpaulin diffusers and 120 mm net confusors) significantly reduces the number of undersized cod (<35 cm), even down to 1.3%, in the haul and contributes to a reduction in invisible mortal discard."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972e6","609235a69543c73526c48cea","5e709284878c28a04739725f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1131","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972e6","65cb5d0c4097072cdd77adb6","65cb5d0c4097072cdd77adb7","65cb5d0c4097072cdd77adb8","5e709284878c28a04739725f","609235a69543c73526c48cea","65cb5d0c4097072cdd77adb9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences-Basel","issn":"2076-3417","eissn":"2076-3417","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"8a20a31f-8131-4357-899d-7b8f694df717"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b0d1e74097073c3fa0e323","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"dddfeef1-e83e-449d-92a5-71ad60abd1ab"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Baltic fishery","selective fishing","bottom trawl design","ultracross codend","diffuser"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059405237"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f","name":"JAROMIR","lastName":"MYSŁOWSKI","uuid":"8ABC36B4EFDB49B6F02207FDB71D428632BF913305051EB0AB5211D4E0E0B01ECD75C85CAE5C5C4E966C716F6F381C79E06CA0922404FDDB79F4A1FCDA90B6D9","orcidId":"0000-0002-5464-7622","documentHash":"c5370dca-4288-4a36-a4cd-21f6188b816c"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972eb","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"ŚLĄCZKA","uuid":"759D7BBB207B434EFA81A5CA6F08F7D206BED69E025A0F821F004076FA7A0CDD9783E41F2B94B43A5AE5CF41E1690AD8A01EDD81784FB6469F9F64AD37799A08","orcidId":"0000-0003-3265-9726","documentHash":"c3a0236f-a4c1-4ffe-8618-771c3f20fc03"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972e0","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"TREICHEL","uuid":"B2F2A6FA3E785F27D2BE375C81CCDA0857A1743AF4CA8D8888B9FAEB697E314F95B29A2749B04DA9DD854B28BCB7F92CD64777561CEF245E40BF0CD49B6715B7","orcidId":"0000-0002-6030-8336","documentHash":"f1548e0a-154b-4dce-992c-9501e85d5ffb"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397244","name":"JAN","lastName":"DRZEWIENIECKI","uuid":"F8B7912FFC9D0D6640FC6A737769EA9162C4AC8BBAF8472A996A844550348BA557488C629C5462974A14EDB24300E55A7BA80A357A556442FE8BABB521BE50B9","orcidId":"0000-0001-8758-8131","documentHash":"5063154c-9fc1-47e2-8aeb-456a33963407"}],"objectId":"65ce12054097074ca0bd2e88","publicUri":"https://ios.edu.pl/dzialalnosc-wydawnicza/pozycje-wydane/","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Ograniczenie emisji do środowiska naturalnego czynników szkodliwych pochodzących z jednostek eksploatowanych na polskich obszarach morskich","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Omawianie zagadnień związanych z emisją czynników szkodliwych do środowiska naturalnego ze statków i morskich obiektów technicznych warto rozpocząć od ustalenia zakresu znaczeniowego pojęcia emisji. Według definicji podanej w Słowniku Języka Polskiego PWN [2022] emisja oznacza wypuszczanie do atmosfery pyłów lub gazów oraz wysyłanie przez ciała energii w postaci światła, dźwięku i elektronów. W Ustawie Prawo ochrony środowiska dodatkowo podkreślono fakt, że emisja odbywa się bezpośrednio lub pośrednio w wyniku działalności człowieka i polega na wprowadzeniu do powietrza, wody, gleby i ziemi substancji lub energii w postaci energii cieplnej, hałasu, wibracji lub pola elektromagnetycznego [Ustawa… 2021]. Przepisy Konwencji MARPOL, dotyczące statków morskich, emisję definiują natomiast jako każde wydalenie ze statków do atmosfery lub do morza substancji zubażających warstwę ozonową, tj. tlenków azotu i tlenków siarki, cząstek stałych oraz lotnych związków organicznych [MARPOL, Zał. VI, Prawidło 2, 2015]. Przebieg eksploatacji niemal wszystkich jednostek pływających wiąże się z emisją do środowiska czynników szkodliwych. Wyposażenie statków w maszyny energetyczne, realizacja zadań przeładunkowych czy pobyt osób na statku wiąże się z emisją lub usuwaniem do środowiska substancji i energii. Biorąc pod uwagę częstość występowania czynników szkodliwych powstających w powiązaniu z transportem towarów i osób oraz ich oddziaływanie na otoczenie, należy przyjąć, że największy wpływ na zmiany zachodzące w klimacie mają emisje substancji do atmosfery oraz energii cieplnej do środowiska. Emisja do środowiska niepożądanej energii w postaci światła, dźwięku (hałasu) czy wibracji oraz pól elektromagnetycznych lub elektronów istotna z punktu widzenia oceny całościowego oddziaływania obiektów pływających na środowisko zostanie w toku dalszej analizy jedynie zasygnalizowana."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f","5e709285878c28a0473972eb","5e709285878c28a0473972e0","5e709284878c28a047397244"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"112-122","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972e0","5e709285878c28a0473972eb","5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f","5e709284878c28a047397244"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6525233b4097075c010ac85f","title":"Ochrona klimatu w Polsce – wybrane zagadnienia i rozwiązania","year":2023,"isbn":"978-83-966110-1-7","url":"https://ios.edu.pl/aktualnosci/monografia-ochrona-klimatu-w-polsce-wybrane-zagadnienia-i-rozwiazania/","translation":false,"documentHash":"6c15e32e-ec29-4018-888f-cbaa4b61436b","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb83c","mniswId":"34100","name":"Instytut Ochrony Środowiska - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","documentHash":"6f4fd83d-7dd8-470d-8396-2b8903d91cc1"},"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-10-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["ochrona klimatu","emisja czynników szkodliwych","obszary morskie"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059408374"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65ce0fee4097074ca0bce2e9","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Szymonowicz","documentHash":"fe6e9b6b-fef4-4e85-98f6-2730f9f8b00e"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972eb","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"ŚLĄCZKA","uuid":"759D7BBB207B434EFA81A5CA6F08F7D206BED69E025A0F821F004076FA7A0CDD9783E41F2B94B43A5AE5CF41E1690AD8A01EDD81784FB6469F9F64AD37799A08","orcidId":"0000-0003-3265-9726","documentHash":"c3a0236f-a4c1-4ffe-8618-771c3f20fc03"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397212","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"DEJA","uuid":"47D7CB61583AFB91E88686194C6D7F6B5103105C86EFD98BF14E1E3F1AF0AF93AE62B8ABD6990345D6D8B7473247EE6F6BB81B69277CB6F3C2CB2FB25550B148","orcidId":"0000-0001-5988-788X","documentHash":"ccde8a10-eb07-4055-8225-d2d8aabcdf7b"}],"objectId":"65ce0fee4097074ca0bce2e8","publicUri":"https://ios.edu.pl/dzialalnosc-wydawnicza/pozycje-wydane/","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Ocena wybranych technicznych rozwiązań na statkach morskich w kontekście ochrony klimatu","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W rozdziale przedstawiono wyniki badań, których celem było zaprezentowanie i ocena wybranych rozwiązań technicznych na statkach morskich w kontekście ochrony klimatu z uwzględnieniem aspektów eksploatacyjnych wykazały, że obecnie wiele firm z branży morskiej pracuje nad tego typu rozwiązaniami i coraz częściej są one wykorzystywane w światowej flocie.

Ich spalanie wpływa negatywnie na ludzi i otaczające ich środowisko z powodu wysokiej i stale zwiększającej się emisji dwutlenku węgla (CO2), tlenków azotu (NOx ) i dwutlenku siarki (SO2). Rozwiązaniem tego problemu jest wykorzystanie recyklingu jako metody ograniczającej negatywne skutki i zapobiegającej niedoborom zasobów energetycznych [Balat 2008]. Każdemu jednemu procentowi (1%) wzrostu dochodu narodowego dowolnego kraju odpowiada 0,69% wzrostu ilości wytwarzanych odpadów [Białowiec i in. 2018]. Wzrost zapotrzebowania na energię, stale zwiększające się ilości wytwarzanych odpadów oraz powolne wyczerpywanie możliwych do wydobycia paliw kopalnych to trzy najważniejsze problemy, z którymi zarówno nasz kraj, jak i cały świat będzie musiał się zmierzyć w nadchodzących dziesięcioleciach [Nobre i in. 2019]. W przeszłości najbardziej powszechnym sposobem radzenia sobie z odpadami było ich składowanie. Ma to jednak wiele wad: stanowi zagrożenie dla środowiska, wymaga nadzoru nad takimi składowiskami oraz zajmuje duże powierzchnie [Chalermcharoenrat i in. 2015]. Obecnie jednak obserwuje się powolne odchodzenie od składowania odpadów z tworzyw sztucznych. Niestety w przypadku części odpadów koszt ekonomiczny i inwestycyjny recyklingu oraz odzysku często przekracza wartość odzyskanych materiałów i energii. W celu minimalizacji kosztów opracowuje się odpowiednie systemy zbiórki, transportu oraz selekcji odpadów [Malinowski, Chwiałkowski 2017]."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6164f32875234017e052497d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"74-83","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6164f32875234017e052497d"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6525233b4097075c010ac85f","title":"Ochrona klimatu w Polsce – wybrane zagadnienia i rozwiązania","year":2023,"isbn":"978-83-966110-1-7","url":"https://ios.edu.pl/aktualnosci/monografia-ochrona-klimatu-w-polsce-wybrane-zagadnienia-i-rozwiazania/","translation":false,"documentHash":"6c15e32e-ec29-4018-888f-cbaa4b61436b","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb83c","mniswId":"34100","name":"Instytut Ochrony Środowiska - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","documentHash":"6f4fd83d-7dd8-470d-8396-2b8903d91cc1"},"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-10-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["recykling","paliwa alternatywne"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059409103"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65cb5a924097072cdd7763c3","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Lewicki","documentHash":"70f2577a-195b-4952-bdc4-26d22d982df7"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f","name":"JAROMIR","lastName":"MYSŁOWSKI","uuid":"8ABC36B4EFDB49B6F02207FDB71D428632BF913305051EB0AB5211D4E0E0B01ECD75C85CAE5C5C4E966C716F6F381C79E06CA0922404FDDB79F4A1FCDA90B6D9","orcidId":"0000-0002-5464-7622","documentHash":"c5370dca-4288-4a36-a4cd-21f6188b816c"}],"objectId":"65cb5a924097072cdd7763c2","publicUri":"https://ibima.org/accepted-paper/green-transformation-of-individual-transport-current-state-of-electromobility-case-study-in-poland/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Green Transformation of Individual Transport – Current State of Electromobility – Case Study in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The available literature on the subject emphasizes that green transport based on the idea of electromobility is an inevitable process. The Electromobility Development Program is to become one of the pillars of the Plan for responsible economic development of each country. Its effect is to create conditions for the development of production and popularization of electric vehicles. According to the assumptions of the Polish Ministry of Energy, 1 million electric vehicles are to appear on Polish roads by 2025. The aim of the article is to present the current challenges related to the implementation of this ambitious plan in this difficult economic and social period. Therefore, the article uses the method of observing the state of development of electromobility in relation to the demand and supply sides. In particular, an attempt was made to identify the basic barriers and possible benefits related to the operation of electric vehicles at the end of 2023. This research may contribute to faster development of universal solutions for eliminating existing restrictions and barriers by identifying areas requiring adaptation to new market rules. Additionally, the presented analyzes and diagnoses of the current state can constitute the basis and encouragement for further research on topics related to the promotion of green transport through the development of electromobility in terms of identifying further consequences for all stakeholders of this market."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"14-5-1409","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574186e","mniswId":"862","fullName":"International Business Information Management","shortName":"IBIMA","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"6029aca7-ff4d-42fd-9ba3-6932a546725d"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"65b3826f409707713dfa8dc1","startDate":"2023-11-22","endDate":"2023-11-23","fullName":"42nd International Business Information Management Association Conference","shortName":"42 IBIMA","city":"Seville","country":"ES","website":"https://ibima.org/conference/42nd-ibima-conference/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"334fd31b-f306-4329-a2c6-1af9377e2961"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f","65cb5a924097072cdd7763c3"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["electromobility","green transformation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059418235"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a04739729a","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"PRZYWARTY","uuid":"AF3736DE6F3EB70EC44DA9DD9788243A72254E26027995FBB294F2D1E6075CE6A09082C03F56AD6A9F5314B215431642C80A50385A7EE4232C0A09BA56C1B445","orcidId":"0000-0002-2438-7073","documentHash":"e932335c-40ed-4b06-b512-7035e758976d"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397257","name":"STANISŁAW","lastName":"GUCMA","uuid":"067D323C978A04E1738FD3BC990629D6DB66E1134907156F45ED7EBFF883954C1045402D167DB85E389F84A0A20BCA4DBEB482ECC97A5C0D2869B99BC8D61524","orcidId":"0000-0003-2286-8815","documentHash":"ea30d09e-fba1-4b99-93c5-db818862f72d"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739724e","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"BĄK","uuid":"6DE64B34CE930B368CB6679EC2A53DE31345941E62D7288F10CE619C3A1F189E080E9B55385822B86C1D887BD440E2882815AA954B73F99CC6646011580AF076","orcidId":"0000-0003-4977-6304","documentHash":"ec2c235e-c59c-424d-a727-12857fcce281"}],"objectId":"65ccbcc94097073ccbc92fbd","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-49532-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-49532-8.pdf","type":"BOOK","typeName":"Książka","year":2024,"title":"Safety of Navigation in Restricted Areas: Methods of Risk Estimation and Analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The themes of this monograph include modern engineering problems of marine traffic engineering, focusing on what this discipline deals with: navigational safety assessment methods.

Two test methods were applied, using vibrative (ASTM G-32) and rotating disk rigs, respectively. The kinetic dependences of the erosive destruction of samples of titanium alloy VT3-1 in the initial state, after ion nitriding and stainless steel AISI 321 were obtained. A study of the microstructure, hardness and surface morphology was carried out. The samples were examined using optical and scanning electron microscopy. The relationship between mass loss and cavitation erosion duration was experimentally determined and analyzed. The erosion rate on a rotating disk stand is much higher than during vibration tests. A large cavitation load gradient provides additional opportunities for analyzing the durability of materials and coatings using this method."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a04739722c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2710","pagesFromTo":"12023","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6268aec07523406b88cee67d","65e6dfdd4097077658194026","65e6dfdd4097077658194027","65e6dfdd4097077658194028","65e6dfdd4097077658194029","5e709284878c28a04739722c","65e6dfdd409707765819402a","65e6dfdd409707765819402b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547e315","mniswId":"24302","title":"Journal of Physics: Conference Series","issn":"1742-6588","eissn":"1742-6596","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c0f0e3e6-8a4b-48f2-b946-33ce0fd76472"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e6dfdd4097077658194025","year":"2023","volume":"2710","documentHash":"441fd5e2-870b-429c-bfe8-69fd6f2790dc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["cavitation erosion","a study of resistance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059449397"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65e719b240970776582144e1","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gąsiorek-Kowalewicz","documentHash":"15d0c071-a543-41df-9df4-33057633d15b"},{"objectId":"65e719b240970776582144e0","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Newelski","documentHash":"85af2efd-bd7a-4700-bfd7-68ca3d04b02d"},{"objectId":"65e719b240970776582144df","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Suchodolski","documentHash":"8b4b9641-cf95-42d3-8b9b-dcabe2da8c65"},{"objectId":"65e719b240970776582144de","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Zarębska","documentHash":"41c7c47b-21a2-45ee-9de0-f2d08c7e6e48"},{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aeb89","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"ZARĘBSKI","uuid":"D6476CFEC0C436CBE787E5422200AC6D2F67E3887C1692C5EB7F60A25A83BB553FE981C258A916E273C3F67B8E59A252EEEFECA14C81B6D8F7BAAB9FEB711120","orcidId":"0000-0003-1702-5442","documentHash":"5de7193c-2e14-47ef-8c18-0bdef223387c"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac603","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gąsiorek-Kowalewicz","uuid":"F319F91AFB2B40438B8A0BA67AFC4C151FA8F5096D509667C82722A2AD12FDD44BDBE0A3B7AB83F8B4AE813CAB292887027032629191C3CA33F38F1242324921","documentHash":"753a1a86-ad59-4fc5-90a2-dbabf25ac302"},{"objectId":"5e70926f878c28a047395984","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Zarębska","uuid":"349AA98DD4A13090664AABCCAF7E0C0CF0D82224063C4B5000BAE88F5A937E52A8D54897D06B4E7CCE83012795F560EDC95FCF56E509A92764D38FC48762EEA6","documentHash":"fcfd7535-b2d3-48f1-a178-72880517259a"}],"objectId":"65e719b240970776582144dc","doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2023.187.42","publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/187-Zar%C4%99bska-Suchodolski-Newelski-Zar%C4%99bski-G%C4%85siorek-Kowalewicz.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Eco-innovative solutions in the operation of Municipal Transport Company Sp. z o.o. in Zielona Góra","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de24","uid":"bk8UqEe0F8JQF-eB0VLAY0w","uuid":"41ade527-eee8-4133-87f6-f9acbecc3acf","name":"Uniwersytet Zielonogórski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac603","5e70926f878c28a047395984"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de24","parentUuid":"41ade527-eee8-4133-87f6-f9acbecc3acf","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de24","rootUuid":"41ade527-eee8-4133-87f6-f9acbecc3acf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aeb89"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"187","pagesFromTo":"799--813","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e719b240970776582144de","65e719b240970776582144df","65e719b240970776582144e0","5e7093ab878c28a0473aeb89","65e719b240970776582144e1","5e70926f878c28a047395984","5e70938b878c28a0473ac603"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547a747","mniswId":"200171","title":"Zeszyty Naukowe Politechniki Śląskiej.

model on the ohmic current ramp-up phase of a JET D discharge. The chosen scenario exhibits a hollow profile attributed to core impurity accumulation, which is observed to worsen with the increasing fuel ion mass from D to T. A dynamic D simulation was validated, evolving j, , , , nBe, nNi, and nW for 7.25 s along with self-consistent equilibrium calculations, and was consequently extended to simulate a pure T plasma in a predict-first exercise. The light impurity (Be) accounted for Zeff while the heavy impurities (Ni, W) accounted for Prad. This study reveals the role of transport on the hollowing, which originates from the isotope effect on the electron-ion energy exchange affecting . This exercise successfully affirmed isotopic trends from previous H experiments and provided engineering targets used to recreate the D q-profile in T experiments, demonstrating the potential of neural network surrogates for fast routine analysis and discharge design. However, discrepancies were found between the impurity transport behaviour of QuaLiKiz and QLKNN, which lead to notable hollowing differences. Further investigation into the turbulent component of heavy impurity transport is recommended."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"63","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"66014","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eb0f2f409707216ede2f2e","65eb0f2f409707216ede2f2f","65eb0f2f409707216ede2f30","65eb0f2f409707216ede2f31","65eb0f2f409707216ede2f32","65eb0f2f409707216ede2f33","65eb0f2f409707216ede2f34","65eb0f2f409707216ede2f35","65eb0f2f409707216ede2f36","65eb0f2f409707216ede2f37","65eb0f2f409707216ede2f38","65eb0f2f409707216ede2f39","65eb0f2f409707216ede2f3a","65eb0f2f409707216ede2f3b","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"NUCLEAR FUSION","doi":"10.1088/issn.0029-5515","issn":"0029-5515","documentHash":"88422204-97ec-4fb6-bc55-866a72c6c2e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf16","year":"2023","volume":"63","number":"6","documentHash":"d026af48-e5ab-4135-ab6f-f410b349547a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059455673"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0518","name":"G.","lastName":"Szepesi","documentHash":"cd0b556d-4575-44cb-ada9-a5b67cc6896f"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0517","name":"N.","lastName":"Hawkes","documentHash":"fa38828f-edb8-4f87-bf23-e851f8376ef0"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0516","name":"U.","lastName":"Sheikh","documentHash":"0500567f-0cb0-461a-b2fb-0ed346077ca8"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0515","name":"B.","lastName":"Stein-Lubrano","documentHash":"7471d9d6-50f3-4506-b1aa-9f3a70576761"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0514","name":"R.M.","lastName":"Sweeney","documentHash":"9f347571-cd05-4723-acac-2627b07678bd"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0513","name":"L.L.","lastName":"Lao","documentHash":"9a8cdc1a-bf85-4d14-a650-c0f1db86aa69"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0512","name":"N.","lastName":"Eidietis","documentHash":"40eebaaf-a1b7-4b37-895a-91b8f973d6b0"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0511","name":"C.","lastName":"Akçay","documentHash":"05ee33e4-88b1-45e1-94ab-06ad14867f63"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0510","name":"C.C.","lastName":"Kim","documentHash":"46374bf5-208a-4baa-9b59-a36091fbb3e7"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede050f","name":"B.C.","lastName":"Lyons","documentHash":"25c9e7ee-560f-4a51-9551-927e06226bd1"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede050e","name":"J.","lastName":"McClenaghan","documentHash":"27f434c2-c499-4d77-80f4-db8cf30a704a"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397202","name":"BOHDAN","lastName":"BIEG","uuid":"824102936597EAEAFDC0CA005121E68A31F5CD249313BB3DE7A696711B7AF50AA39660B4406408C7C6F1876B2B4C60A29C04488145A12D92F4454003EDE7904F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3649-6349","documentHash":"4211ff14-2499-4712-b9b5-bf009f77c090"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-09","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede050d","doi":"10.1088/1741-4326/accbd3","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/accbd3","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"MHD modeling of shattered pellet injection in JET","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nonlinear 3D MHD simulations of shattered-pellet injection (SPI) in JET show prototypical SPI-driven disruptions using the M3D-C1 and NIMROD extended-MHD codes. Initially, radiation-driven thermal quenches are accelerated by MHD activity as the pellet crosses rational surfaces, leading to a radiation spike, global stochasticization of the magnetic field, and a complete thermal quench. Eventually, current quenches, preceded by a current spike are seen as the Ohmic heating becomes equal to the radiative cooling. The results are qualitatively similar for both a single monolithic pellet, pencil-beam model, and a realistic shatter to represent the SPI plume. A scan in viscosity from 500 to 2000 m2 s−1 for MHD simulations finds that reducing viscosity increases MHD activity and decreases thermal quench time slightly. A realistic cloud of fragments modeling shows that mixed-D–Ne pellet travels deeper into the plasma core before the thermal quench. At the slow pellet speeds, the pellet is found to be moving slowly enough inward that even the 5% neon in the mixed pellet is enough to effectively radiate the thermal energy available. Radiation toroidal peaking is predicted to be at levels consistent with experimental observations and reduced as the pellet travels deeper into the plasma. These simulations lay the ground work for more-sophisticated validative and predictive modeling of SPI in JET using both M3D-C1 and NIMROD."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"63","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"66029","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eb0aed409707216ede050e","65eb0aed409707216ede050f","65eb0aed409707216ede0510","65eb0aed409707216ede0511","65eb0aed409707216ede0512","65eb0aed409707216ede0513","65eb0aed409707216ede0514","65eb0aed409707216ede0515","65eb0aed409707216ede0516","65eb0aed409707216ede0517","65eb0aed409707216ede0518","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"NUCLEAR FUSION","doi":"10.1088/issn.0029-5515","issn":"0029-5515","documentHash":"88422204-97ec-4fb6-bc55-866a72c6c2e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf16","year":"2023","volume":"63","number":"6","documentHash":"d026af48-e5ab-4135-ab6f-f410b349547a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059455915"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70945b878c28a0473bb36b","name":"RADOSŁAW","lastName":"GORDON","uuid":"BC14FB95D378075C37BC8A4A3153DB5F61467407B793ADB2F3C83159FDA5DACF712205E82184B8A25D58069072D8792FC8B35036C6728B92743592FB661526DB","orcidId":"0000-0001-6340-633X","documentHash":"b973e404-9d99-4945-a00c-fcb706d2386f"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397275","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"KOZAK","uuid":"6686F8D2AE6BEC141649DA7093335B0B2837BDE8ADAAEA334F02AC73C33CD43BDABAEF1350DBE6098DB83B1B6950F00829B7B2941CAD447337B4CEF4AF3B0109","orcidId":"0000-0002-0062-1590","documentHash":"f563722f-8d8b-42f0-8e8b-d2225ee9ca9d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"65eaff36409707216edd400d","doi":"10.3390/en16217405","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/21/7405/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A Novel Method for Diagnosing Power Electronics Devices Using Elastic Wave Emission","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This work is an introduction of acoustic emission (AE) signals used in order to detect the malfunction of selected semiconductor elements.

Unlike many papers, this article shows experimental results demonstrating a comparison of undamaged, properly working and defective IGBT transistors which can be used, for example, as a reference for diagnostic tools.

It is well known that automated identification system (AIS) spoofing can be used for electronic warfare to conceal military activities in sensitive sea areas; however, recent events suggest that there is a similar interest of spoofing AIS signals for commercial purposes. The shipping industry is currently experiencing an unprecedented period of deceptive practices by tanker operators seeking to evade sanctions. Last year’s announcement of a price cap on Russian crude oil and a new ban on Western companies insuring Russian cargoes is setting the stage for an increase in illegal activity. Our research team identified and documented the AIS position falsification by tankers transporting Russian crude oil in closed ship-to-ship (STS) oil transfers. The identification of the falsified positions is based on the repeated instances of discrepancies between AIS location suggestions and satellite radar imagery indications. Using the data methods at our disposal, we reconstructed the true movements of certain tankers and encountered some surprising behavior. These false ship positions make it clear that we need effective tools and strategies to ensure the reliability and robustness of AISs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397247"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"6","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e9a078409707132d3205ec","65e9a078409707132d3205ed","5e709284878c28a047397247","65e9a078409707132d3205ee","65e9a078409707132d3205ef"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c925","mniswId":"11734","title":"Journal of Marine Science and Engineering","doi":"10.3390/jmse","issn":"2077-1312","eissn":"2077-1312","documentHash":"edcb89a0-e925-4fa7-bd52-7548b4265d6d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e9a078409707132d3205eb","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"1","documentHash":"352666a3-d269-4b5f-b9ba-927142814b5e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["automatic identification system (AIS)","tankers","falsification","spoofing and jamming"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488082"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf20","name":"Paula","lastName":"Sirén","documentHash":"21c12286-b6d8-4775-8bcc-fb98b63e4faa"},{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf1f","name":"Sergei","lastName":"Sharapov","documentHash":"9880fac8-5141-4603-b75b-2a9ed1763cf1"},{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf1e","name":"Fernando","lastName":"Nabais","documentHash":"c440c3be-3c38-4a42-8fb7-e72d1a9b2a11"},{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf1d","name":"Mervi","lastName":"Mantsinen","documentHash":"c8a91515-4292-4d5e-8384-04ba812ac44b"},{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf1c","name":"António","lastName":"Figueiredo","documentHash":"8a53de1e-4e2f-4b5e-af53-88b0c9f2473f"},{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf1b","name":"Jorge","lastName":"Ferreira","documentHash":"1b2052c1-8ef3-4201-95ce-0f2cf9a1fdbe"},{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf1a","name":"Rui","lastName":"Coelho","documentHash":"4ae0be4e-11fb-4fa1-8ca4-6bef17b8358e"},{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf19","name":"Francesca","lastName":"Cella","documentHash":"50e83686-25d1-4ba7-bdde-785105d73e02"},{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf18","name":"Duarte","lastName":"Borba","documentHash":"f743d6b3-20b4-4882-a168-b7f0335450b3"},{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf17","name":"Paulo","lastName":"Rodrigues","documentHash":"74855f82-8f9f-4971-a31f-7928673547da"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397202","name":"BOHDAN","lastName":"BIEG","uuid":"824102936597EAEAFDC0CA005121E68A31F5CD249313BB3DE7A696711B7AF50AA39660B4406408C7C6F1876B2B4C60A29C04488145A12D92F4454003EDE7904F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3649-6349","documentHash":"4211ff14-2499-4712-b9b5-bf009f77c090"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-18","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf15","doi":"10.1088/1741-4326/acc814","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/acc814","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"High-order coupling of shear and sonic continua in JET plasmas","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A recent model coupling the shear-Alfvén and acoustic continua, which depends strongly on the equilibrium shaping and on elongation in particular, is employed to explain the properties of Alfvénic activity observed on JET plasmas below but close to the typical frequency of toroidicity-induced Alfvén eigenmodes (TAEs). The frequency gaps predicted by the model result from high-order harmonics of the geodesic field-line curvature caused by plasma shaping (as opposed to lower-order toroidicity) and give rise to high-order geodesic acoustic eigenmodes (HOGAEs), their frequency value being close to one-half of the TAEs one. The theoretical predictions of HOGAE frequency and radial location are found to be in fair agreement with measurements in JET experiments, including magnetic, reflectometry and soft x-ray data. The stability of the observed HOGAEs is evaluated with the linear hybrid magnetohydrodynamic/drift-kinetic code CASTOR-K, taking into account the energetic-ion populations produced by neutral beam injection and ion cyclotron resonance heating systems. Wave-particle resonances, along with drive/damping mechanisms, are also discussed in order to understand the conditions leading to HOGAEs destabilisation in JET plasmas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"63","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"66011","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eb07a8409707216eddaf17","65eb07a8409707216eddaf18","65eb07a8409707216eddaf19","65eb07a8409707216eddaf1a","65eb07a8409707216eddaf1b","65eb07a8409707216eddaf1c","65eb07a8409707216eddaf1d","65eb07a8409707216eddaf1e","65eb07a8409707216eddaf1f","65eb07a8409707216eddaf20","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"NUCLEAR FUSION","doi":"10.1088/issn.0029-5515","issn":"0029-5515","documentHash":"88422204-97ec-4fb6-bc55-866a72c6c2e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf16","year":"2023","volume":"63","number":"6","documentHash":"d026af48-e5ab-4135-ab6f-f410b349547a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059488223"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c7","name":"NATALIA","lastName":"WAGNER","uuid":"26E53CDC2FD3099002948F30AA2D35392306E07B07818599B3E7D17A8D7F2EE9ED0B1B30B78FCD2C46741A3A2084611956C050ED59175CB2D0CBFD32C7925C1D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6898-4737","documentHash":"ba5e1d6d-7560-4ad8-9072-54e365477c50"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"65e9c4c9409707132d35b61b","doi":"10.3390/en16217403","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/21/7403","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Inventive Activity for Climate Change Mitigation: An Insight into the Maritime Industry","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Climate change mitigation is one of the most important challenges facing the modern world. It is necessary to monitor the development of new concepts and technologies and take a stab at identifying disruptive innovations, which have the potential of becoming real climate-friendly game changers. The aim of this paper is to examine the patterns of inventive activity aimed at mitigating climate change in the maritime industry with respect to other transport modes. Appropriate research tools in the area of patent analysis were selected and utilised. A new class of patents related to climate change in maritime transport (CPC-Y02T70/00) was used as a data source. The original value of the study consists of offering a complete picture of the efforts made in patenting activity in climate change mitigation in the maritime transport, with a look at leading applicants and countries, knowledge flows, the most robustly developed and underdeveloped technical fields. A map of technical knowledge flows for climate change mitigation in transport was constructed. The research results show that inventions for the maritime industry are less hermetic than those for air and road transport; however, they are not as much linked with previously developed solutions. The most intensively developed technical fields include the design and construction of watercraft hulls (1) and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to the propulsion system (2). Among the technologies whose further development merits close attention are solutions related to electrical propulsion and wave energy. At the same time, inventive activity in the area of climate change adaptation dedicated to ports is insignificant and definitely needs more support from the community of scientists and inventors. Building knowledge based on patent information can help universities, research institutions, shipyards, manufacturers of marine equipment and other business entities to identify the technologies of the greatest potential for further development."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"21","pagesFromTo":"7403","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972c7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"653b4b0c409707677d744980","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"16","number":"21","documentHash":"958acc36-d9e7-4e0f-aeec-4ef6984792ee"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["climate change","ship propulsion","technology management","maritime industry","sustainability management"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488725"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65eaf794409707216edcb4ae","name":"Marek","lastName":"Jaskiewicz","documentHash":"e04fdf71-1e62-4952-aac0-907e226625cb"},{"objectId":"6365d8b97523405a7dce8d98","name":"TYMOTEUSZ","lastName":"ZALESKI","uuid":"621DC995E94FFD7CD388643F2789646872B1D0EBBE934D3FB5BA7C75ED0ED8D4FAF75F324848052C24062EEA6F7BDD2BE1EF1407DD6FF32583F53AD6F2906BD0","documentHash":"6c1dda74-bec4-46c5-a961-6e2b5c86cd41"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972d9","name":"DARIUSZ","lastName":"TARNAPOWICZ","uuid":"B2F02446E4E95D09304ED7E7491C0B7D2AE99EB31D6FF1BF764F887969968F5FBF2DC02529ABCC9FF3FEAFF38527EFCA11C2110CDDC46DE85D51FAD2569698E7","orcidId":"0000-0002-9456-2316","documentHash":"9dd63c94-31b7-4b82-a056-3203ea65be2a"},{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f5db","name":"ZBIGNIEW","lastName":"MATUSZAK","uuid":"79FF4750CEDCBED8184B9DEEC9D1866909AB3DFEF0280B4195035B33B2887CFC9C47CD503FF849D865899B1E9CF1DDBF8D74385A4710AABC7A38D2216F74CD79","orcidId":"0000-0002-0554-730X","documentHash":"1772d383-b930-4121-b854-c86fc297ad5e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"65eaf794409707216edcb4ad","doi":"10.3390/en17010031","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/1/31/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Energy Optimization of Marine Drive Systems with Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The International Maritime Organization are introducing more and more stringent requirements concerning increasing ships’ energy efficiency. They are becoming a huge challenge for design engineers. This article proposes a method to increase the energy efficiency of mechatronic drive systems in ship systems via the use of highly efficient electric permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). An innovative control strategy is suggested. It is based on the modification of the classic PMSM control and ensuring energy optimization through a reduction in reactive power in the Active Converter–PMSM system. Analytical and simulation studies using the Matlab–Simulink program are presented. They confirm the possibility of reducing reactive power in a PMSM drive system. A verification of the results of analytical and simulation examinations was conducted at a laboratory station with the use of the Speedgoat module operating in the Rapid Control Prototyping mode. Both the simulation and experimental research results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed PMSM control method.

Fusion 58 066006). By collecting divertor probe data obtained during many dozens of ELMs, the conditional-average (CAV) technique yields surprisingly low peak electron temperatures, far below the pedestal ones (70%–99% reduction!) which we, however, question. This result was interpreted through the collisional free-streaming kinetic model of ELMs, by a transfer of most of the electron energy to ions, implying a high tungsten sputtering for unmitigated ELMs in future fusion devices like ITER. Recently, direct microsecond temperature measurements on the COMPASS tokamak, however, showed that the electron temperature peak of ELM filaments measured in the divertor is reduced by less than a third with respect to the pedestal one. This was further confirmed by a dedicated 1D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation and tends to prove that the pedestal electrons can transfer only their parallel energy to ions (due to low collisionality), thus less than a third, as is predicted by the collisionless free-streaming model. This finding strongly contradicts the JET observations. We have therefore compared the CAV to the direct (microsecond) ball-pen and Langmuir probes measurements in COMPASS and found very good agreement between them. Revisiting the aforementioned JET CAV analysis indeed shows that the electron temperatures are much higher than previously reported, close to those predicted by the PIC simulation, and thus the ion energy seems to not significantly increase in the scrape-off laye."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"63","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"56007","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eb03a2409707216edd8505","65eb03a2409707216edd8506","65eb03a2409707216edd8507","65eb03a2409707216edd8508","65eb03a2409707216edd8509","65eb03a2409707216edd850a","65eb03a2409707216edd850b","65eb03a2409707216edd850c","65eb03a2409707216edd850d","65eb03a2409707216edd850e","65eb03a2409707216edd850f","65eb03a2409707216edd8510","65eb03a2409707216edd8511","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"NUCLEAR FUSION","doi":"10.1088/issn.0029-5515","issn":"0029-5515","documentHash":"88422204-97ec-4fb6-bc55-866a72c6c2e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ae65ac409707287bf1c46a","year":"2023","volume":"63","number":"5","documentHash":"8aa1f339-0b64-4d49-9da5-988c0715ae1f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059492014"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66067f1a40970745a4fc8895","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Kapała","documentHash":"e66ac1a9-c6f9-4d14-8ddb-bea91e00b32e"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a3f9","name":"MONIKA","lastName":"BORTNOWSKA","uuid":"4721D47F4B26496F8CC040792B220097BC86BD15631073E53DF5B4B4FCE2EB7A6DAC108EDFB27220AA47168854A40A05BC9413ADD20404873603EF307656EFBE","orcidId":"0000-0003-1441-934X","documentHash":"2cc9c7f7-6f66-4c24-b6ee-e5ab0b64b745"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"66067f1a40970745a4fc8894","doi":"10.17402/594","publicUri":"https://repository.am.szczecin.pl/handle/123456789/2811","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Design analysis of an innovative concept of a displacement motor yacht with eco-drive","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In response to the challenges of environmental protection and the need to be close to nature and to reconnect with it, an unusual motor yacht design is developed with an abstract architectural form modeled on an armadillo. Due to the innovative form of the hull, a specific approach to pre-design is used, with the research objective of verifying that for the organic form of the hull, it would be possible to meet all the design criteria and regulations required for the design of a yacht. This article first characterizes the initial assumptions and then presents the process of determining the main dimensions with simultaneous modification of the hull shape. In order to maintain the basic dimensional proportions, based on the classic motor yacht, the recommended values of design factors are controlled. Moreover, the hydrostatic parameters of the unconventional hull shape are calculated. As a result of preliminary resistance and propulsion analyses, a propulsion system in the form of electric motors is selected, and, to meet emission requirements, the use of photovoltaic panels is additionally proposed. A stability and equilibrium analysis is carried out for one of the load cases and checked with the requirements of the Polish Register of Shipping (PRS) rules. The design of the hull of the yacht, covered in an interesting form of scales, together with the layout of the yacht’s interior, is presented in three-dimensional form, bringing the conceptual idea to life. The result of the design work and analysis is an inspiring hull shape based on nature, complying with the design guidelines and regulations that apply to yacht design."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a3f9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"77","issue":"149","pagesFromTo":"29-37","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a3f9","66067f1a40970745a4fc8895"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a6e6","mniswId":"18270","title":"Scientific Journals of the Maritime University of Szczecin-Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii Morskiej w Szczecinie","issn":"1733-8670","eissn":"2392-0378","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fdb820fa-cedd-41fe-95cd-b3a078aeeee6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66067d3540970745a4fc8550","year":"2024","volume":"77","number":"149","documentHash":"984de3aa-b88f-4024-80e0-097ef14a1248"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["conceptual design","futuristic motor yacht","electric propulsion","stability analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059512059"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094be878c28a0473c2f2f","name":"OLEKSANDRA","lastName":"OSYPCHUK","uuid":"C063F2C7D19BE0512F4FE02AC5B4AD163098AE1F16ABE71082A68B9ED776497D5809B591A8DE6D0E3F9AAD9EE498B8B78CB367B483A14D1BF4D6B9C11799F546","orcidId":"0000-0002-2712-245X","documentHash":"a85260b2-de07-45ad-bef8-15b0d725c9de"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a047398792","name":"MARIUSZ","lastName":"NÜRNBERG","uuid":"611C6B9520888F4F9FC1C661F65AB65D9BE18FBB4B89C5A2A9764D7BAAE6EC3BE66E78812C7AB27D6AF28C775761C4941C784F823FE49156BC402164AD3D45B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4275-1350","documentHash":"96a5086f-ccf1-4d13-93c7-96f8c6fd95aa"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a04739878d","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"SOSIK","uuid":"7303E5F94578AD8AF6CE5E1EA42AAA913DAA20273FAE743ABC01D946A064AC0B73752F5402F17113B7C00EA14FDC55196ABD85438495680AE6DFF2B3E095134E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1298-9955","documentHash":"1fdc555a-df6a-40c1-8a30-eb4b24b28538"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397203","name":"STANISŁAW","lastName":"IWAN","uuid":"F493D83A4967CDDC3DD6CAC0D263937EF19134C3A98DCBADBC71C2176DAFAF818DD157A33208F63C12260CAEEC6848D8CE3E15014DDE047F7A199750A3B87CDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-5480-5475","documentHash":"3c8e640e-f90a-4332-a130-9623e9c950b3"},{"objectId":"5e7091f7878c28a04738dce2","name":"MARIUSZ","lastName":"JEDLIŃSKI","uuid":"FE32B4379F4773E30ECCC934EEA2804C18B4B44DEAEBD05D92C860F8892D31BDBE80849F1FE208F6477B416288F0721DBFBCA2A30204B8C7782352045374DED8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4227-2755","documentHash":"86c8be66-5730-457f-92fb-eae238ebca6c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-12-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6606892c40970745a4fcea83","doi":"10.1016/j.trpro.2023.11.329","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2352146523006269?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Analysis of contemporary scientific achievements in the field of Urban Freight Transport in terms of the use of knowledge-based management","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"One of the most important city logistics problem is the lack of knowledge resources related to the freight flows and routes at the city area.

In order to achieve this, it was necessary to develop, in detail, research sub-objectives like analysis of the intensity of ship traffic in the indicated area and analysis of LNG demand in maritime transport. In the first part of this study, the authors use data from the IALA IWRAP Mk2 and the Statistical Office in Szczecin to analyse the marine traffic density (by type of vessel) in the southern part of the Baltic Sea. LNG used as marine fuel reduces toxic emissions into the atmosphere. The authors specify the LNG fleet size and locations of LNG storage facilities in a way to ensure that the defined LNG bunker vessels can supply fuel to LNG-powered vessels within the shortest possible time period. The database contains a set of traits necessary to determine the optimal demand for LNG. The traits were developed based on an existing LNG fleet and appropriately selected infrastructure, and they represent existing LNG-powered vessels as well as LNG bunker vessels and their specifications. Based on the created LNG distribution model, were performed in Matlab R2019a software. An LNG distribution model was developed, which uses a genetic algorithm to solve the task. The demand for LNG for the sea area under analysis was determined based on data on the capacity of LNG-powered vessels (by type of vessel) and their distance from the specified port."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ba878c28a0473afdae"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1758","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ba878c28a0473afdae","6614fda04097075b4776c53d","6614fda04097075b4776c53e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66027c054097071d5ba0b629","year":"2024","volume":"17","number":"7","documentHash":"9abbcf62-30f0-48e9-b9f4-f312b8c9704c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["energy security","traffic modelling","transport infrastructure","transportation safety","traffic optimisation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059532822"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6617797f409707791fca79c9","name":"Junmin","lastName":"Mou","documentHash":"e9753cec-c886-4e20-aab6-8a209aedeed0"},{"objectId":"6617797f409707791fca79c8","name":"Mengxia","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"3bcdfb36-9400-4762-b293-999b5773569b"},{"objectId":"6617797f409707791fca79c7","name":"Junhui","lastName":"Wen","documentHash":"10986793-287b-4b41-9b45-afa96da7bd7c"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390892","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"GUCMA","uuid":"0E5FE9A95A7C302D3F64BB5CCA8799076D3E393D98664C3EAF36D518754A484BB8AC514B9232CD32F12FD15A9433401120179A39822C9688C157EBB3A2212DC2","orcidId":"0000-0002-7501-5632","documentHash":"5db43317-7105-4bee-b280-f4edb8ba8062"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6617797f409707791fca79c6","doi":"10.3390/app131810282","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/18/10282/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Multi-Object Detection for Inland Ship Situation Awareness Based on Few-Shot Learning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology and unmanned surface vehicle (USV) technology, object detection and tracking have wide applications in marine monitoring and intelligent ships.

The transfer learning strategy is designed, innovatively using an open dataset of vehicles on highways to improve object detection accuracy for inland ships. The Shuffle Attention mechanism and smaller anchor boxes are introduced in the object detection network to improve the detection accuracy of different targets in different scenes.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions can be undertaken, among other things, by reducing the weight of the container, which is possible if lighter materials with comparable mechanical properties to steel are used. The LCA analysis allowed us to estimate the energy consumed and the amount of greenhouse gases emitted during the production of a steel and composite container. It turned out that the energy consumed in the production of the composite and steel container is practically equal in value, provided that carbon fiber from the polyolefin precursor is used in production. The processes with the highest energy intensity for container production are carbon fiber and COR-TEN A® steel production and processing. Changing the container material from steel to composite would save fuel and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere by 5.1 % and 18.3 % for road transportation and sea shipping, respectively."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709469878c28a0473bc84c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"77","issue":"149","pagesFromTo":"47-62","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709469878c28a0473bc84c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a6e6","mniswId":"18270","title":"Scientific Journals of the Maritime University of Szczecin-Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii Morskiej w Szczecinie","issn":"1733-8670","eissn":"2392-0378","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fdb820fa-cedd-41fe-95cd-b3a078aeeee6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66067d3540970745a4fc8550","year":"2024","volume":"77","number":"149","documentHash":"984de3aa-b88f-4024-80e0-097ef14a1248"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["composite materials","management","shipping container","life cycle assessment","green technology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059540321"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6615014d4097075b47770cf9","name":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Ioppolo","documentHash":"e26d2974-d2d7-4ad9-8d53-93413f31245b"},{"objectId":"6615014d4097075b47770cf8","name":"Mario","lastName":"Fazio","documentHash":"66b5d46b-e0ea-4c73-aba2-40e9228aedc5"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0edf","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Barczak","uuid":"A7460359BD34F727D2883019B3878448DD628202B9D5D2F9C6110267714FAD33ADAF2EC50AC8C89F7B818F599B6CA937CC32990BB01226EAF720BE01BEDB9E4C","orcidId":"0000-0001-7584-7183","documentHash":"59a4aba3-d82e-4484-8d97-4ab4f73a34bc"},{"objectId":"5e7092b0878c28a04739abdb","name":"Angelika","lastName":"Kędzierska-Szczepaniak","uuid":"CF75A83F4E910D9A01E7D9FC3F0D8B705CF546C988788E93FCBC15782E0877AAB9595F8A2E9DF9F406C41CD4F178E850EA117606B0A98425F518682ADDFFDC0A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6760-7809","documentHash":"ec065206-faac-4a42-a2da-5d31d9f61816"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a022","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Szopik-Depczyńska","uuid":"EA9443BA6C20A3BA8E90088314C2C3C7ECC227CAD044166E089723FCC1A3B5DA1DE61210080C0E54424DD154C9AC5231AC31F70B2404E74C04F672BE4FF618B4","orcidId":"0000-0002-3054-0660","documentHash":"1d7d16f5-b57c-42e3-aff4-e6295d206a79"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a04739734f","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Dembińska","uuid":"6E0CCB552E15C0C9EEA5F662CBB97C0534018B4663DA7819A399C98739CCFBE37E274217735CA7D4CBCD736EF96A54E27ABECEF3E7ECEE7A8F2C772979EC0E2B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7618-0018","documentHash":"556fae66-299f-4452-b536-659e4803d33a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6615014d4097075b47770cf7","publicUri":"https://journals.economic-research.pl/eq/article/view/2732","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The impact of crowdsourcing and user-driven innovation on R&D departments’ innovation activity: Application of multivariate correspondence analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Research background: In enterprise practices, innovation management is taking on more and more open forms. New, creative sources of inspiration are being sought. More and more companies are opening up to cooperation with external people or entities, thus entering a path of open innovation and crowdsourcing. This development is facilitated by increasingly large numbers of online and virtual communities. The idea is to use the potential of the crowd — collective intelligence and creativity. As the strategy is still developing, knowledge in this area is limited. There is a paucity of research on the impact of crowdsourcing on R&D departments and their innovative activities.\nPurpose of the article: The study aims to determine whether the use of customer support in the form of crowdsourcing affects the innovative activities of R&D departments that implement user-driven innovation (UDI).\n\nMethods: An original questionnaire was used for the study. Fifty-seven R&D departments in Poland participated in the research. A correspondence analysis, performed on the basis of the Burt matrix, was applied for the analysis. The authors also used Cramer's V correlation coefficients. Examination of the acquired correlation coefficients reveals the existence of four distinct categories of enterprises regarding the usage of crowdsourcing and implementation of product innovations, completed R&D projects, employment in R&D departments, and percentage of revenue allocating in R&D works.\nFindings & value added:  Research has shown that R&D departments positively evaluate the effects of using UDI in market research analyses of customer purchasing behavior. It helps to create or improve products or services offered on the market, especially in the field of customization, using the information from national research and development units at the same time. Their purpose is mainly to increase the product range. The findings can help academics and practitioners improve the body of knowledge about the determinants of innovation activity, especially concerning relationships with customers and user-driven innovation practices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a04739734f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"171-206","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a8878c28a04739a022","5e709285878c28a04739734f","5e709301878c28a0473a0edf","5e7092b0878c28a04739abdb","6615014d4097075b47770cf8","6615014d4097075b47770cf9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479dfd","mniswId":"5903","title":"Equilibrium.

Unlike many similar-sounding papers, this article shows an attempt at creating fully controllable non-isolated system that allows for load-power sharing between a permanent magnet alternator equipped with machine-side converter (MSC) and a dual active bridge (DAB) tied to batteries or supercapacitor. The current-based load-power sharing is an essential feature of parallel-connected direct-current generators, and all types of voltage sources, in this way are contributing power to the system. To keep the optimal efficiency of the alternator, the rotational speed changes rely on proper mapping of the driving combustion engine. System components include a self-excited synchronous generator (SESG), operating at variable shaft speed, as well as batteries and supercapacitors that provide electricity for sudden electrical-load changes on the distribution grid. The core of the presented system is in a power-distribution method that consists of a programmed-controller structure allowing precise current distribution. A novelty of the proposed method is the use of a cascaded system of current and DC voltage regulators that allows for precise power-distribution control. In contrast with previously presented solutions, the proposed system allows for fast and accurate control of currents, loading parallel-connected DC voltage sources for wide-range generator speed changes. In the presented solution, both converters have been equipped with Schottky diodes, preventing the flow of equalizing currents between closed transistors in the parallel mode of operation. An experimental test-stand of the described system is presented with its theoretical basis and experimental results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397275"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1365","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397275","660fb507409707210bc13d93","660fb507409707210bc13d94"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bfef","mniswId":"5581","title":"Electronics (Switzerland)","eissn":"2079-9292","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"d24835fa-79e8-41ed-9235-04b77a1dc9bd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"660125454097076263178dc5","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"13","number":"7","documentHash":"b60cade2-fb83-4936-9012-68103288a3cd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["microgrids","power distribution","active circuits","bridge circuits","pulse width modulation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059550850"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"661503eb4097075b47773ed3","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Danisiewicz","documentHash":"e02a7585-498f-46e3-8c62-41d9f16f51f5"},{"objectId":"661503eb4097075b47773ed2","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Jóźwiak","documentHash":"2c203e00-1e77-4dec-b99c-dc4da73ded71"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397277","name":"PRZEMYSŁAW","lastName":"KOWALAK","uuid":"2EA7F27056A434CF012451AC34D216D10816F646B957DA806631AA8D5AE16509D7353AD848A9C97425A7A7130EBB79CB29EE052B70ACC95A657D2A232282E495","orcidId":"0000-0003-1370-2231","documentHash":"b3fa661a-82b3-4109-ad0c-347e53d44483"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2024-03-26","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"661503eb4097075b47773ed0","doi":"10.1016/j.measurement.2024.114589","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0263224124004743?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The assessment of surface acoustic wave sensing for testing fuel dilution of lubricating oils","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article presents an assessment of the accuracy and repeatability of oil dilution measuring apparatus. The device uses surface acoustic wave sensing (SAW), and the measurement method meets the ASTM D8004 standard. Since the described in the ASTM standard definitions of accuracy and repeatability are not easy to compare with definitions in the ISO standards, a comparative experiment was settled. Mixtures of the SAE 30 and SAE 40 grades lubricating oil with diesel oil in a high-precision concentration of 0, 1, 2, 5, and 10 % m/m were tested. The calculated root mean square error (RMSE) of measurement results against the expected value, was RMSESAE 30 = 0.57 % m/m and RMSESAE 40 = 1.33 % m/m. Additionally, the method based on the flash point was tested to compare estimated dilutions (SAW vs. flashpoint). The results show that the flash point gives a better estimation than SAW.

The initiation of this research is justified by the fact that a model created from diverse types of data may have different surface textures and outliers. This diversity may cause problems in subsequent data processing stages, such as generating depth contours. As part of the adopted research methodology, fifteen filters were analysed. Filtering techniques were examined for filter type, the number of iterations, weights, and window size. The result is the adopted research methodology, which enabled the selection of the optimal filtering method. The research undertaken in this work is an extension of the methodology for developing an HDBM. An important aspect of the research is the approach to elaborating on such kinds of models in shallow and ultra-shallow waters adjacent to the land, as well as the use of data obtained by modern measurement platforms, such as unmanned surface vehicles (USV) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The studies fit into the general context of works related to the development of this type of model and undoubtedly provide a solid reference for further development or improvement of similar methods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972b2","5e709285878c28a0473972ed"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"4737","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972b2","5e709285878c28a0473972ed"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","issn":"2072-4292","eissn":"2072-4292","websiteLink":"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing","documentHash":"70fe2a0d-444c-49ea-9c4d-4dcd904ee147"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"657acf6640970710192dc814","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"19","documentHash":"1738f4c8-8817-471b-8255-383a81e9ddfb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hydrography","digital bathymetric model","digital terrain model"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059557690"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"662107b4409707632369f1df","name":"F.","lastName":"Rimini","documentHash":"38d7ac75-1514-4bf1-a216-202f10616896"},{"objectId":"662107b4409707632369f1de","name":"G.","lastName":"Miron","documentHash":"d4dd1047-3d47-4726-8ad2-7fae1d50b4f2"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397202","name":"BOHDAN","lastName":"BIEG","uuid":"824102936597EAEAFDC0CA005121E68A31F5CD249313BB3DE7A696711B7AF50AA39660B4406408C7C6F1876B2B4C60A29C04488145A12D92F4454003EDE7904F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3649-6349","documentHash":"4211ff14-2499-4712-b9b5-bf009f77c090"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"662107b4409707632369f1dc","doi":"10.1088/1741-4326/acedc1","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/acedc1","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Dynamic error fields derivation by inverting a validated interpretative perturbations model","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The need for a model able to provide the dynamic evolution of the intrinsic magnetic error fields amplitude in tokamaks is of a significant importance in order to develop strategies to correct its destabilizing effect.

Fusion61 106016) is used to calculate the plasma instabilities amplitude and frequency aiming to match the same quantities provided by the device diagnostics data analysis specific code for various discharges at JET. The mentioned good match ensures our model validity against the experimental results. Based on its proven structural validity, our model considering the error field quantities is inverted. This time the initial direct model output results, namely the plasma perturbations amplitude and frequency, become input data for our inverse model aiming to solve the corresponding error field modes system of equations searched as unknowns. The error fields basically satisfy the same outer plasma perturbed equations as the plasma perturbations do (vacuum/wall/plasma column external structures). Obviously they do not satisfy the perturbed plasma equations. A clear and explicit dynamic error field solution is finally provided. It has been demonstrated that whenever the error fields are responsible for the mode locking effect and plasma rotation damping, the calculated error fields shows its expected disruptive resonant behavior during various discharges at JET."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"63","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"106001","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["662107b4409707632369f1de","662107b4409707632369f1df","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"NUCLEAR FUSION","doi":"10.1088/issn.0029-5515","issn":"0029-5515","documentHash":"88422204-97ec-4fb6-bc55-866a72c6c2e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"662107b4409707632369f1dd","year":"2023","volume":"63","number":"10","documentHash":"ecfb3a08-ece7-455b-91ce-028933fdb602"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dynamic error fields derivation","interpretative perturbations model"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059557864"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b271","name":"JET","lastName":"Contributors","documentHash":"c5750999-f883-41f0-9621-4dbee2612fd4"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b270","name":"the ASDEX","lastName":"Upgrade Team","documentHash":"1a8e2aca-a90e-4b18-bc41-480c0318c77c"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b26f","name":"S.","lastName":"Gerasimov","documentHash":"ed3c01fd-a262-4769-8cff-7359ee7efa8c"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b26e","name":"G.","lastName":"Pautasso","documentHash":"ad523850-f8f8-4fd5-9cd0-d3a1c19cede2"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b26d","name":"G.","lastName":"Papp","documentHash":"11ab8d8e-4daf-4a50-8c4c-6f7d92bfb910"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b26c","name":"P.","lastName":"de Marné","documentHash":"a60dbd5a-3bcb-45c2-a523-b0f253401c64"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b26b","name":"P.","lastName":"Heinrich","documentHash":"7bf4c90f-7f5e-441b-bc07-b9548b4ac428"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b26a","name":"L.","lastName":"Giannone","documentHash":"597e94e1-216c-4a0c-8b33-0fddf76c8018"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b269","name":"M.","lastName":"Dunne","documentHash":"6934e31f-72ae-48ef-b9ed-c3eb5dd820d7"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b268","name":"T.","lastName":"Driessen","documentHash":"06a73d2f-57ed-4d3b-8406-17ad468c1a1b"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b267","name":"A.","lastName":"Bock","documentHash":"5fd9e13a-dd46-4637-8f00-4c092a33b29d"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b266","name":"M.","lastName":"Bernert","documentHash":"0c363ab5-2e3f-4742-9eab-bb63ec470b12"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b265","name":"M.","lastName":"Hoelzl","documentHash":"46f68924-16d6-4bb3-9577-b48bea4fdd67"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b264","name":"F.","lastName":"Vannini","documentHash":"06795ef2-bd39-4f98-b996-223cd58644f9"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b263","name":"F.J.","lastName":"Artola","documentHash":"9abdc5d3-b8d6-4c2e-a4dc-fd515722126a"},{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b262","name":"N.","lastName":"Schwarz","documentHash":"766ef4dd-d8f7-46a4-bfe1-efb8c81d0b2d"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397202","name":"BOHDAN","lastName":"BIEG","uuid":"824102936597EAEAFDC0CA005121E68A31F5CD249313BB3DE7A696711B7AF50AA39660B4406408C7C6F1876B2B4C60A29C04488145A12D92F4454003EDE7904F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3649-6349","documentHash":"4211ff14-2499-4712-b9b5-bf009f77c090"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"66210356409707632369b260","doi":"10.1088/1741-4326/acf50a","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/acf50a","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The mechanism of the global vertical force reduction in disruptions mitigated by massive material injection","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Disruptions lead to a rapid loss of thermal and magnetic energy and can cause large heat loads, mechanical forces, and the excitation of a beam of relativistic runaway electrons. The operation of tokamaks at high energy and plasma current requires the use of a mitigation system to limit such detrimental effects. Mitigation techniques rely mainly on the injection of a large amount of impurities to radiate the majority of the thermal and magnetic energies. Heat loads and electro-magnetic (EM) forces as well as their toroidal asymmetries can be greatly reduced by such measures. In this paper, a theory is lined out to explain the reduction of the global vertical force based on large toroidal halo currents that keep the current centroid stationary in the midplane. As a consequence, the vertical current moment, which is linked to the EM-force, is reduced. The theory is backed up by experimental observations in shattered pellet injection mitigated vertical displacement event experiments in ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) and JET as well as by 2D simulations with the extended MHD code JOREK. Scans in the boundary heat flux are carried out to estimate the correct scrape-off layer temperature and the influence of the fraction of conducted energy. Finally, predictive simulations for ITER confirm the reduction of the vertical force by the injection of impurities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"63","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"126016","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66210356409707632369b262","66210356409707632369b263","66210356409707632369b264","66210356409707632369b265","66210356409707632369b266","66210356409707632369b267","66210356409707632369b268","66210356409707632369b269","66210356409707632369b26a","66210356409707632369b26b","66210356409707632369b26c","66210356409707632369b26d","66210356409707632369b26e","66210356409707632369b26f","66210356409707632369b270","66210356409707632369b271","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"NUCLEAR FUSION","doi":"10.1088/issn.0029-5515","issn":"0029-5515","documentHash":"88422204-97ec-4fb6-bc55-866a72c6c2e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b261","year":"2023","volume":"63","number":"12","documentHash":"f42c6b45-52f7-44bc-b92f-fdf1ee95285f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["the mechanism of the global vertical force reduction","massive material injection"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059558053"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739726b","name":"OLEH","lastName":"KLYUS","uuid":"A6125A6D7042694805585D228FF1E11710B26ABCEDE2484011D0B952D80C118EF0DB72DEF3A5165A412B59EE01656260D1DDEB45EA9931E127193648A3F8D6A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-9849-5974","documentHash":"ab147927-87b8-491c-a616-48178c5528b2"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397215","name":"CEZARY","lastName":"BEHRENDT","uuid":"C7460767A0FD33C8E5C7ACE46EBD2FE218FC2DE163B06D3F7F7D439414769B361B4A2631DC9767205C89C1BEF75B440756927BB9E0665476285678C7DD3814BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1403-4802","documentHash":"f8f35665-07fc-4471-92bd-1565eb2e7cda"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6620fc38409707632368e6b9","doi":"10.3390/en16207177","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/20/7177","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Reductions in Energy Consumption and Emission of Harmful Exhaust Gases by Fishing Vessels","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article presents an analysis of the influence of engine types, fuel types and selected methods of fuel treatment before injection on reductions in fuel consumption and exhaust emission components. This is the first of such studies, the continuation of which will allow a comprehensive assessment of the impact of cutter operations on environmental pollution. For the selected type of cutter, EEOIs (Energy Efficiency Operational Indicators) were determined to be a measure that takes into account both fuel consumption and harmful gas compound emissions depending on the type of engine used and the type of fuel. The data necessary to prepare this analysis were obtained during operational tests carried out on selected cutters with various types of engines fuelled with liquid fuel and a new catalytic fuel treatment method developed by the authors, while for the case of using gas fuel and a common rail engine, possible effects were forecasted. The effects of engine type, years of manufacture and fuel type (liquid and gas) on fuel consumption and emissions of selected exhaust components are demonstrated. The positive effects on fuel consumption and emissions of harmful exhaust constituents obtained, under laboratory test conditions, for an engine fuelled with catalytically treated fuel have allowed further research directions to be set for cutter engines equipped with injection equipment with applied catalytic coatings."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c8","5e709284878c28a04739726b","5e709284878c28a047397215"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"7177","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397215","5e709284878c28a04739726b","5e709285878c28a0473972c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65361ebe4097072f84f60183","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"20","documentHash":"185f9564-020f-4eed-8094-63aa8ac10a1b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["combustion engines","fishing cutters","real-exploitation gas emission","liquid fuel treatment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059561367"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696f09","name":"D.","lastName":"van Eester","documentHash":"468368d4-ca49-490b-9724-07a842dcac50"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696f08","name":"F.","lastName":"Rimini","documentHash":"d7908d60-3a83-4e2d-9540-e97b3ba36e99"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696f07","name":"G.","lastName":"Pucella","documentHash":"967e6020-6cc7-4309-9ee3-155b92d0f0d0"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696f06","name":"S.","lastName":"Menmuir","documentHash":"64b64429-9923-48fd-b92b-12971b3f0d1e"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696f05","name":"M.","lastName":"Marin","documentHash":"e666ae1c-586c-4184-b492-27c1102a56f9"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696f04","name":"P.","lastName":"Lomas","documentHash":"0bce0418-3d7d-4fe9-9b1e-4f453cdc020c"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696f03","name":"F.","lastName":"Koechl","documentHash":"4266ae47-71a5-429d-9a5a-05d2684faac8"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696f02","name":"C.","lastName":"Giroud","documentHash":"8af5d22e-74b5-4c2f-bdfe-bc06a4c92fdf"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696f01","name":"R.","lastName":"Gatto","documentHash":"1eb9da00-4510-4275-911c-bf938a79b4dc"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696f00","name":"D.","lastName":"Frigione","documentHash":"111d4f9b-e872-4628-a55c-d5d790c3636d"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696eff","name":"J.","lastName":"Citrin","documentHash":"5bde1439-a50b-4b2a-a523-0f4ed3160330"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696efe","name":"F.J.","lastName":"Casson","documentHash":"0588bdcb-49f9-45d2-9d8a-cbfabfaf19e2"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696efd","name":"C.","lastName":"Bourdelle","documentHash":"ef240a76-d19f-460b-8d13-d3c49e15375c"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696efc","name":"V.K.","lastName":"Zotta","documentHash":"d376337b-6a27-445e-8266-0ac4288f1d9a"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696efb","name":"L.","lastName":"Garzotti","documentHash":"04d1c82e-0ccb-426a-ab0d-43dd855c3ffb"},{"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696efa","name":"S.","lastName":"Gabriellini","documentHash":"25139255-7799-4928-a883-0efa1fd7c0ef"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397202","name":"BOHDAN","lastName":"BIEG","uuid":"824102936597EAEAFDC0CA005121E68A31F5CD249313BB3DE7A696711B7AF50AA39660B4406408C7C6F1876B2B4C60A29C04488145A12D92F4454003EDE7904F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3649-6349","documentHash":"4211ff14-2499-4712-b9b5-bf009f77c090"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6621000b4097076323696ef8","doi":"10.1088/1741-4326/ace2d7","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ace2d7","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Neon seeding effects on two high-performance baseline plasmas on the Joint European Torus","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present the JETTO-QuaLiKiz-SANCO fully predictive modelling of two JET-ILW high-performance baseline plasmas, a Ne seeded shot and an equivalent unseeded one. The motivation of the work lies in the experimental observation of a slightly higher confinement and performance of the Ne seeded shot with respect to the unseeded one, despite sharing the same main plasma parameters and heating powers. Moreover, the neon seeded shot shows a lower pedestal electron density and a higher core ion temperature with respect to the unseeded one. Integrated modelling is performed in order to understand if the cause of the improved confinement has to be ascribed to the improved pedestal parameters with neon seeding or if an impurity-induced turbulence stabilization is at play. The QuaLiKiz transport model is used for predicting the electron density, electron and ion temperatures and rotation in the core up to the pedestal top, while the pedestal is empirically modelled to reproduce the experimental kinetic profiles. The thermal diffusivities of the two shots, computed by QuaLiKiz, are compared, as well as the turbulence spectra, suggesting that the reduced transport found in the neon seeded shot is due in part to the stabilization of ion temperature gradient and electron temperature gradient modes. Further modelling is performed in order to disentangle the neon seeding effects, which are a direct effect on the turbulence stabilization and an indirect effect on the pedestal parameters. The results suggest that the improved performance with neon is due to a combination of turbulence stabilization and improved pedestal parameters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w

mode detection during error field identification studies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"At the beginning of a machine operation, an assessment of the intrinsic error fields, spurious magnetic field perturbations which can affect plasma dynamics, is often carried out by executing the compass scan method [Scoville J.T. et al. Nucl. Fusion 43 250 (2003)]. This method relies on the application of 3D magnetic fields with various phases, induced by EF correction coils, to trigger a locked mode. The instant of locked mode onset allows the identification of the amplitude and phase of the intrinsic error field, from which the empirical correction currents for its minimization can be deduced. The presence of a locked mode needs to be carefully monitored during this study because of the potential disruptive mode behavior, especially in devices which can tolerate a maximum number of disruptions, as in SPARC and in ITER. A novel method, the so-called non-disruptive compass scan method [Paz-Soldan C. et al., Nuclear Fusion 54 (2014) 073013], avoids the disruption risk, as the name recalls, via magnetic island healing, i.e. stabilizing the locked mode. The magnetic island healing is achieved by switching off the error field correction coil current during the execution of the compass scan and asynchronously by increasing the plasma density. The crucial point of this new method is the detection of the locked mode to initiate the EFCC-density control actions. In this work, the locked mode detector adopted during non-disruptive compass scan test at JET is presented, together with brand-new locked mode metrics, which take into account the actual poloidal deformation due to a locked mode and a class of MHD instabilities, named Beta Alfvén Eigenmodes, that appear in the Mirnov signal in concomitance to the locked mode. The use of multiple metrics for locked mode detection during the execution of the non-disruptive compass scan increases the fidelity of the real-time control system to pinpoint the event, compensating possible magnetic probe failure, and initiate the control sequences to heal the magnetic island."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"195","pagesFromTo":"113957","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6627a4484097072ea08dad02","6627a4484097072ea08dad03","6627a4484097072ea08dad04","6627a4484097072ea08dad05","6627a4484097072ea08dad06","6627a4484097072ea08dad07","6627a4484097072ea08dad08","6627a4484097072ea08dad09","6627a4484097072ea08dad0a","6627a4484097072ea08dad0b","6627a4484097072ea08dad0c","6627a4484097072ea08dad0d","6627a4484097072ea08dad0e","6627a4484097072ea08dad0f","6627a4484097072ea08dad10","6627a4484097072ea08dad11","6627a4484097072ea08dad12","6627a4484097072ea08dad13","6627a4484097072ea08dad14","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d90","mniswId":"6925","title":"FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN","issn":"0920-3796","documentHash":"accc2e9d-5dd5-4b28-bdf5-8f505d620cbc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"650ace824097070d18c03021","year":"2023","volume":"195","documentHash":"27d6f2e9-79d4-470f-9774-2835eab5338d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["JET","MHD instabilities","plasma control"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059571398"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd13","name":"D.","lastName":"Valcarcel","documentHash":"8209ccd7-7d39-47d8-abcc-1372febd4378"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd12","name":"L.","lastName":"Moreira","documentHash":"3e057cc2-a483-4d19-ab2b-c603cfe6104c"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd11","name":"J.","lastName":"Mailloux","documentHash":"353319e9-1509-426c-945a-46113b2bf18d"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd10","name":"Y.Q.","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"6a666a86-9091-4002-acba-e1f2ea5f90e8"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd0f","name":"M.","lastName":"Lennholm","documentHash":"81e65a01-3807-432b-b1e9-86fb49f5bd8f"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd0e","name":"M.","lastName":"Lehnen","documentHash":"543a0b04-0384-4710-a52c-aa7719900c6e"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd0d","name":"E.","lastName":"Joffrin","documentHash":"3895d8ca-c9f7-4a60-88ec-31127a152772"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd0c","name":"S.","lastName":"Jachmich","documentHash":"300c94dc-b26f-4fad-b7d6-7cf74125205a"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd0b","name":"N.","lastName":"Hawkes","documentHash":"a80fa24e-b969-43a2-b4d2-bacc00bd3dfa"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd0a","name":"R.B.","lastName":"Henriques","documentHash":"415b4bcc-1540-4591-bf96-610a24d1240d"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd09","name":"T.C.","lastName":"Hender","documentHash":"1e9386f1-5296-422e-a81a-e772cfacf50d"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd08","name":"M.P.","lastName":"Gryaznevich","documentHash":"afc9035a-0b75-472d-9542-7bf86711ca21"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd07","name":"C D","lastName":"Challis","documentHash":"518d65de-7e59-4b1b-babe-3f4df3165860"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd06","name":"L","lastName":"Baylor","documentHash":"3247fe28-e00a-45a7-b7b1-ac9113ba1eb0"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd05","name":"M.","lastName":"Baruzzo","documentHash":"33be8eae-30ec-413c-a883-375ae7e68193"},{"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd04","name":"L.","lastName":"Piron","documentHash":"5ee98218-05ea-4caf-820c-8c3272ed8603"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397202","name":"BOHDAN","lastName":"BIEG","uuid":"824102936597EAEAFDC0CA005121E68A31F5CD249313BB3DE7A696711B7AF50AA39660B4406408C7C6F1876B2B4C60A29C04488145A12D92F4454003EDE7904F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3649-6349","documentHash":"4211ff14-2499-4712-b9b5-bf009f77c090"}],"objectId":"6627a8124097072ea08dcd02","doi":"10.1016/j.fusengdes.2023.114069","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S092037962300649X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"On the use of error field correction coils in JET","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This work describes the usage of Error Field Correction Coil (EFCC) system [Barlow I. et al. 2001 Fusion Eng.

However, achieving net energy from fusion reactors requires a more profound understanding of the underlying physics and the development of efficient control strategies. Plasma diagnostics are vital to these efforts, but accessing local information often involves solving very ill-posed inverse problems. Regrettably, many of the current approaches for solving these problems rely on simplifying assumptions, sometimes inaccurate or not completely verified, with consequent imprecise outcomes. In order to overcome these challenges, the present study suggests employing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to tackle inverse problems in tokamaks. PINNs represent a type of neural network that is versatile and can offer several benefits over traditional methods, such as their capability of handling incomplete physics equations, of coping with noisy data, and of operating mesh-independently. In this work, PINNs are applied to three typical inverse problems in tokamak physics: equilibrium reconstruction, interferometer inversion, and bolometer tomography. The reconstructions are compared with measurements from other diagnostics and correlated phenomena, and the results clearly show that PINNs can be easily applied to these types of problems, delivering accurate results. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of PINNs as a powerful tool for integrated data analysis. Overall, this study demonstrates the great potential of PINNs for solving inverse problems in magnetic confinement thermonuclear fusion and highlights the benefits of using advanced machine learning techniques for the interpretation of various plasma diagnostics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"63","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"126059","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6627a1664097072ea08d5eaa","6627a1664097072ea08d5eab","6627a1664097072ea08d5eac","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"NUCLEAR FUSION","doi":"10.1088/issn.0029-5515","issn":"0029-5515","documentHash":"88422204-97ec-4fb6-bc55-866a72c6c2e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66210356409707632369b261","year":"2023","volume":"63","number":"12","documentHash":"f42c6b45-52f7-44bc-b92f-fdf1ee95285f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["neural networks","PINN"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059571678"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f85479f085dcb410a25ed62","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"KOŁODZIEJSKI","uuid":"210EF03D6DA369CB2F9B948CB1072C71A44AE572A22620B6FB75D2ED8F7E7C7143E134366D65B9A851BA6DC243AB85EF388BB706937D295A7F5477BEA07143EE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9651-6057","documentHash":"952373d9-0988-433e-bf92-b6fe292543a9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66617e9f409707458fb2ea1d","doi":"10.24425/ather.2023.149728","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/149728/edition/131158/content","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Review of hydrogen-based propulsion systems in the maritime sector","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The maritime industry is undergoing a technology transition that aims to increase the use of low-emission fuels. There is a significant trend visible of new ships being ordered with alternative fuel propulsion. In the future shipping’s fuel market will be more diverse and it will rely on multiple energy sources. One of the very promising ways to meet the International Maritime Organisation’s decarbonization requirements is to operate ships with sustainable hydrogen propulsion. One of the possible options to limit greenhouse gases emissions is the production of low-carbon ‘green’ hydrogen by water electrolysis using low-carbon electricity. This hydrogen can then be used directly in fuel cells to produce electricity or in the internal combustion engines, without having a carbon impact and pollutant emissions. Hydrogen can also be converted into its derivatives. This paper presents a review of recent studies of ships’ hydrogen propulsion systems, different aspects of production, transportation, storage, and using liquid/gaseous H2 and its derivatives as a fuel in the shipping industry.

The shoreline allows cropping of the image into two separate areas that present the water area and the shore. It is particularly interesting because the images can be used to analyze pollution, land development, or even waterfront erosion. Unfortunately, automatic shoreline detection is a complex problem due to numerous physical and atmospheric issues. In this paper, we present a solution based on a U-net convolutional network, that is trained to shoreline detection on a dedicated database. The database is automatically generated by applying image processing techniques and a heuristic algorithm. Using heuristics, optimal values of mask generation parameters are determined. Consequently, the solution allows for the automation of generating a set of masks by analyzing the boundary line and the efficiency of the segmentation network. The proposed solution allows for the analysis of the coastline, where potential obstacles and even occurring waves can be quickly detected. To evaluate the proposed solution, tests were carried out in real conditions, which showed the effectiveness of the model. In addition, tests were carried out on a publicly available database, which allowed for obtaining higher results than existing methods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"102","pagesFromTo":"108-118","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66617c07409707458fb2b98c","66617c07409707458fb2b98d","5e709285878c28a0473972c4","66617c07409707458fb2b98e","66617c07409707458fb2b98f","66617c07409707458fb2b990"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b909","mniswId":"772","title":"Alexandria Engineering Journal","issn":"1110-0168","eissn":"2090-2670","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3e6775ea-f175-4c15-98f8-4cb19e391943"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66617c07409707458fb2b98b","year":"2024","volume":"102","documentHash":"1d4fea62-129c-4f67-8c41-311050727d6c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["U-net","shoreline detection","heuristic","adaptive method","automated solution"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059634726"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c6","name":"ANNA","lastName":"WOLNOWSKA","uuid":"FF75E3DA7ABDDDC6886D370AEEB9195B1BC2442921231AF1C016067E8726C5CDC6C692EDB04B1A973D7FF95DE6CE1C366E78B39E24D385B40844677400AB6A35","orcidId":"0000-0003-4074-5747","documentHash":"9c762f5e-1b1a-4ef2-a37a-0524db34f077"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397221","name":"LECH","lastName":"KASYK","uuid":"D4E1AF8525D000E24B40B4327B84B26C11B14FC0AE51B25E3CA6EF897DDA00563B6EEF017851659581ED3236C3C714C1EC058722F2826FE1445EA173E424F98D","orcidId":"0000-0002-4719-0695","documentHash":"1b83e982-6aee-4f77-a509-03ac43d88035"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6672c11e4097074b6cea530f","doi":"10.3390/su16093620","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/9/3620/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Study of the Demand for Ecological Means of Transport in Micromobility: A Case of Bikesharing in Szczecin, Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The need for urban societies to move continues to grow with the intensity of their various activities. One of the challenges in micromobility in cities based on bike, scooter, or public scooter systems is determining the potential yet realistic demand for such services. This article aims to present the level of demand for eco-friendly non-motorized transport systems and identify the motivations driving users of public transport to choose these eco-friendly Personal Mobility Devices (PMD). The authors propose a methodology based on the integration of four components: a case study, an analysis of participatory budget projects, a metadata analysis of bikesharing (BSS) in Szczecin, and a meta plan. They utilized a case study method and conducted a survey based on a custom questionnaire. An analysis of participatory budget projects and data from the operation of bikesharing in Szczecin was performed using statistical methods. Applying the heuristic tool meta plan, they outlined the directions for the development and support of bikesharing as an example of micromobility in Szczecin. The research identified connections between the socio-demographic structure of respondents and attributes of bike communication. This study highlighted periods of intensive system use and locations with the highest exploitation. It showed that the demand for BSS depends on weather conditions, traveler convenience, the density and coherence of bike infrastructure with important locations for residents, transfer connections, and safety. The presented research results can assist planners and authorities in Szczecin and other cities in expanding bikesharing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c6","5e709284878c28a047397221"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"3620","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972c6","5e709284878c28a047397221"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff3f8ad49b31ccec0f80e","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","documentHash":"4055bfb8-4fdb-408c-b314-7aa556a417fb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6672c11e4097074b6cea5310","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"9","documentHash":"2b569b5a-d8e5-4dc2-a384-d0956ef357a5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["passenger transport","public transport","non-motorized transport","micromobility","bikesharing","participating budget"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059634929"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"640fea3a7523407854447a86","name":"ALEKSANDRA","lastName":"CHEŁSTOWSKA","uuid":"9A8C7EA783AAD573DF381CCB290F833420AC573CC94E2684FE7A86D0B734B1AE8A18D41D5A2203A9A5E03072F0A53531D1A9DD4B6F90852E323C010D4A37215E","orcidId":"0009-0000-3193-1973","documentHash":"c9eb84e4-a564-408b-a7ed-a2cc93108933"},{"objectId":"5e7094be878c28a0473c2f2f","name":"OLEKSANDRA","lastName":"OSYPCHUK","uuid":"C063F2C7D19BE0512F4FE02AC5B4AD163098AE1F16ABE71082A68B9ED776497D5809B591A8DE6D0E3F9AAD9EE498B8B78CB367B483A14D1BF4D6B9C11799F546","orcidId":"0000-0002-2712-245X","documentHash":"a85260b2-de07-45ad-bef8-15b0d725c9de"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a04739878d","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"SOSIK","uuid":"7303E5F94578AD8AF6CE5E1EA42AAA913DAA20273FAE743ABC01D946A064AC0B73752F5402F17113B7C00EA14FDC55196ABD85438495680AE6DFF2B3E095134E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1298-9955","documentHash":"1fdc555a-df6a-40c1-8a30-eb4b24b28538"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","releaseDateMonth":"JUNE","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"66619479409707458fb602c7","publicUri":"https://repository.am.szczecin.pl/handle/123456789/2820","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The impact of construction projects on transport accessibility in cities based on the example of Szczecin","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"With the dynamic socio-economic development of cities, actions of key importance have become necessary to ensure the required accessibility of urban transport.

The results of the research are benchmarked in terms of the correctness of the implementation of the bending process, including the change in the pipe outside diameter and wall thickness. The level of ovalisation of the cross-section in the bending pipe is used as the primary criterion for assessing the correctness of the bending process. The results show that the most favourable properties in terms of minimising the ovalisation of the pipe cross-section are provided by the use of a bending form with a trapezoidal shape."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a047397282","5e709284878c28a047397223"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"78","issue":"150","pagesFromTo":"35-48","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a047397282","66618c4b409707458fb4c854","5e709284878c28a047397223"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a6e6","mniswId":"18270","title":"Scientific Journals of the Maritime University of Szczecin-Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii Morskiej w Szczecinie","issn":"1733-8670","eissn":"2392-0378","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fdb820fa-cedd-41fe-95cd-b3a078aeeee6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66618c4b409707458fb4c853","year":"2024","volume":"78","number":"150","documentHash":"cb7ce777-d15f-4454-820a-55f6520ee674"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pipelines","cold bending","stress and plastic strain","deformation assessment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059635419"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667292fe4097074b6cda6ee1","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Logan","documentHash":"02db6277-6ab0-4c79-89b5-9b058502e241"},{"objectId":"667292fe4097074b6cda6ee0","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Pochwatko","documentHash":"72684302-287b-4110-ab2b-5eaec2894c3b"},{"objectId":"667292fe4097074b6cda6edf","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Kowalski","documentHash":"e4175aaf-2bd2-40b6-b55f-6f8a55eda1d7"},{"objectId":"667292fe4097074b6cda6ede","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Kopeć","documentHash":"a03c5ffb-96cb-4270-ba0a-400244767a15"},{"objectId":"667292fe4097074b6cda6edd","name":"Jazmin","lastName":"Collins","documentHash":"39da53d9-102f-406e-8552-96b81b47157f"},{"objectId":"667292fe4097074b6cda6edc","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Cnotnowski","documentHash":"2664350c-93a0-40c0-b74d-5262b3234b82"},{"objectId":"667292fe4097074b6cda6edb","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Bohdanowicz","documentHash":"8a80d0fc-f406-44e4-9905-f3665ce914b9"},{"objectId":"667292fe4097074b6cda6eda","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Biele","documentHash":"d4a22423-9a1c-46a7-9305-71b668ca0796"},{"objectId":"667292fe4097074b6cda6ed9","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Abramczuk","documentHash":"0c7eb5ea-ba64-48ff-995f-d5f685248c0d"},{"objectId":"667292fe4097074b6cda6ed8","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Skorupska","documentHash":"0bb11c42-aec3-433a-8e77-8fef1ec8d643"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a047398776","name":"BARTOSZ","lastName":"MUCZYŃSKI","uuid":"D0E81164CD7ECE49DA6347B89BD353827C10B723D3CD3B60A9E23C98A66AC4EDF9C9B8F356C7D7D61CAC89BD79A567C22E45ED454C067FC5714B4E5926279ED8","orcidId":"0000-0002-0559-4181","documentHash":"2b32c4d8-772d-43cf-90a7-69104da48b22"}],"objectId":"667292fe4097074b6cda6ed6","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-42293-5_94","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-42293-5_94","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"VR Accessibility in Distance Adult Education","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes more pervasive, it continues to find multiple new uses beyond research laboratories. One of them is distance adult education—the potential of VR to provide valuable education experiences is massive, despite the current barriers to its widespread application. Nevertheless, recent trends demonstrate clearly that VR is on the rise in education settings, and VR-only courses are becoming more popular across the globe. This trend will continue as more affordable VR solutions are released commercially, increasing the number of education institutions that benefit from the technology. No accessibility guidelines exist at present that are created specifically for the design, development, and use of VR hardware and software in distance education. The purpose of this workshop is to address this niche. It gathers researchers and practitioners who are interested in education and intend to work together to formulate a set of practical guidelines for the use of VR in distance adult education to make it accessible to a wider range of people."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709295878c28a047398776"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14145","pagesFromTo":"685 - 691","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574183c","mniswId":"807","fullName":"IFIP TC13 Conference on Human-Computer Interaction","shortName":"Interact","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"1dd06a7d-f4b1-4bec-985e-7bc731796ab1"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"65aa78734097071977e4dd85","startDate":"2023-08-28","endDate":"2023-09-01","fullName":" Human-Computer Interaction – INTERACT 2023","shortName":"INTERACT 2023","city":"York","country":"GB","website":"https://interact2023.org/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"59d61bdf-1874-4444-b95a-2c2ebbe9ece7"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709295878c28a047398776","667292fe4097074b6cda6ed8","667292fe4097074b6cda6ed9","667292fe4097074b6cda6eda","667292fe4097074b6cda6edb","667292fe4097074b6cda6edc","667292fe4097074b6cda6edd","667292fe4097074b6cda6ede","667292fe4097074b6cda6edf","667292fe4097074b6cda6ee0","667292fe4097074b6cda6ee1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e72c872467f01e931107a7","title":"LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE","issn":"1865-0929","documentHash":"2ce42c9d-dadb-4b27-8b04-4c045d5dc637"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"667292fe4097074b6cda6ed7","year":"2023","volume":"14145","documentHash":"625c2217-f84a-4319-b0eb-177363720d18"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["accessibility","virtual reality","case studies","distance education"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059635440"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633503297523402e340d735a","name":"ROBERT","lastName":"SZTANGIERSKI","uuid":"2EA4D4A1BFFA74C036261358BDFA1FAE12CDA175EC6C2F7A6ED951C38169F932B1FCBB8BB73E9A0CAA4E7EBCD43B87B6B65050F68E0265EC356E8143039335AF","documentHash":"91e47110-db4f-4b8d-bd19-434281799561"},{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e052497d","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"BROŻEK","uuid":"4635B57887278636145F7244DEB98B68F0D8FE6C5ADE495765BC130C7E90C26B200477CB06A9DD3CC11530816F9279B27C62568C179399FA5C4326B6AF52A668","orcidId":"0000-0002-5022-6492","documentHash":"520540ee-1ccc-4ca7-8403-81909f61e278"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6672bbe14097074b6ce9ec50","doi":"10.3390/en17092047","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/9/2047/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Modeling of Selected Parameters of Used Lubricating Oil Diluted with Diesel Oil Using the Characteristics of Fresh Lubricating Oil","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article presents the verification of the hypothesis on using certain approximation curves in the evaluation of used lubricating oil. These curves are plotted for fresh lubricating oil to approximate the parameters of lubricating oil diluted with diesel oil. To confirm the hypothesis, an experiment is conducted to determine the flash point, initial boiling point, density at 15 °C, kinematic viscosity at 40 °C and 100 °C, and viscosity index. The analysis covers fresh oil and used SAE 30 grade Marinol CB-30 RG1230 oil taken from the circulating lubrication system of a supercharged, trunk-piston, 4-stroke ZUT Zgoda Sulzer 5 BAH 22 engine that is located in the Marine Power Plant Laboratory of the Maritime University of Szczecin. Undiluted lubricating oils (both fresh and used) and mixtures of lubricating oils with diesel oil are examined for diesel oil concentrations in the mixture equal to 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20% m/m. Orlen Efecta Diesel Biodiesel is used to prepare the mixtures. The functions approximating the parameters for fresh oil are determined and adapted to describe the variation of the same parameters for the used lubricating oil. For each case, the coefficient of determination, the maximum relative error of the model fitting to the experimental results, and the root mean square error (RMSE) are determined. In the experiment, the variation in the parameters of the used lubricating oil remained the same as for fresh oil parameters. Thus, the research hypothesis is confirmed.."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c8","633503297523402e340d735a","6164f32875234017e052497d","5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"2047","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245","5e709285878c28a0473972c8","633503297523402e340d735a","6164f32875234017e052497d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"662b490340970762633e8ef3","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"9","documentHash":"240aee71-7f05-4a5f-9600-fe8282633a37"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["density","marine diesel engine","diesel oil","fuel dilution","lubricating oil","flash point","initial boiling point","viscosity index"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059652083"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6672d1d24097074b6cec59e8","name":"JET","lastName":"Contributors","documentHash":"569ed89c-da5b-493b-aecc-ada5abcbd98f"},{"objectId":"6672d1d24097074b6cec59e7","name":"J.","lastName":"Mailloux","documentHash":"5df2761a-f1e8-49df-867f-95179d31dc20"},{"objectId":"6672d1d24097074b6cec59e6","name":"A.","lastName":"Loarte","documentHash":"e91a6c16-cc39-4cb7-80de-925f8350d2aa"},{"objectId":"6672d1d24097074b6cec59e5","name":"E.","lastName":"Lerche","documentHash":"fcd40472-66f5-4688-9206-083955eb084a"},{"objectId":"6672d1d24097074b6cec59e4","name":"Hyun-Tae","lastName":"Kim","documentHash":"36c5d99b-3a17-44fc-b40d-8c8953e10060"},{"objectId":"6672d1d24097074b6cec59e3","name":"A.","lastName":"Kappatou","documentHash":"c0885be2-c299-4900-8dfc-fc3c92063128"},{"objectId":"6672d1d24097074b6cec59e2","name":"J.","lastName":"Hobirk","documentHash":"57a5fec6-a755-4476-bd2f-d2bb487f0db3"},{"objectId":"6672d1d24097074b6cec59e1","name":"C.

Through careful optimisation of the hybrid-scenario, deuterium plasmas with sufficient heating power (greater than or similar to 32 MW), high enough ion temperature gradients at the H-mode pedestal top can be achieved for the collisional, neo-classical convection of the W impurities to be directed outwards, expelling them from the confined plasma. Measurements of the W impurity fluxes between and during edge-localised modes (ELMs) based on fast bolometry measurements show that in such plasmas there is a net efflux (loss) between ELMs but that ELMs often allow some W back into the confined plasma. Provided steady, high-power heating is maintained, this mechanism allows such plasmas to sustain high performance, with an average D-D neutron rate of similar to 3.2 x 10(16) s(-1) over a period of similar to 3 s, after an initial overshoot (equivalent to a D-T fusion power of similar to 9.4 MW), without an uncontrolled rise in W impurity radiation, giving added confidence that impurity screening by the pedestal may also occur in ITER, as has previously been predicted (Dux et al 2017 Nucl.

A basic stability analysis, in this case, could be insufficient when considering other related factors like cargo shift, taking up water on the weather deck, wind gusts, inaccuracy of transverse metacentric height, and the case of changing transverse metacentric height in long-crested waves.

These environments, with their diverse distribution of optically relevant components, pose a challenge to traditional mapping methods. The study was conducted on several research issues, each focusing on a specific aspect of the SDB, related to the selection of spectral bands and regression models, regression models creation, evaluation of the influence of the number and spatial distribution of reference soundings, and assessment of the quality of the bathymetric surface, with a focus on microtopography. The study utilized basic empirical techniques, incorporating high-precision reference data acquired via an unmanned surface vessel (USV) integrated with a single-beam echosounder (SBES), and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver measurements. The performed investigation allowed the optimization of a methodology for bathymetry acquisition of such areas by identifying the impact of individual processing components. The first results indicated the usefulness of the proposed approach, which can be confirmed by the values of the obtained RMS errors of elaborated bathymetric surfaces in the range of up to several centimeters in some study cases. The work also points to the problematic nature of this type of study, which can contribute to further research into the application of remote sensing techniques for bathymetry, especially during acquisition in optically complex waters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972b2","5e709285878c28a0473972ed"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"3165","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66eef8c9fdbe834dc425a7e2","5e709285878c28a0473972b2","5e709285878c28a0473972ed"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","doi":"10.3390/rs","issn":"2072-4292","eissn":"2072-4292","documentHash":"4455816a-4488-4bca-b561-a29136e7efc7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66eef8c9fdbe834dc425a7e1","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"17","documentHash":"7ab704c8-83e3-4e4c-a3d0-5777e775135d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["image processing","high-resolution images","SDB","regression model"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059763073"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f66177fdbe831edead3c65","name":"Mustafa","lastName":"Necati Çoban","documentHash":"5e9b6914-5d96-4b20-a5af-076a8f9bbe7e"},{"objectId":"66f66177fdbe831edead3c64","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Radulescu","documentHash":"c73b953a-ba45-46a9-a7a6-9fa1dbc5d6b4"},{"objectId":"66f66177fdbe831edead3c63","name":"Ayoub","lastName":"Zeraibi","documentHash":"f9750d25-aca6-40e1-a2e4-eedf962166c2"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a04739734f","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Dembińska","uuid":"6E0CCB552E15C0C9EEA5F662CBB97C0534018B4663DA7819A399C98739CCFBE37E274217735CA7D4CBCD736EF96A54E27ABECEF3E7ECEE7A8F2C772979EC0E2B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7618-0018","documentHash":"556fae66-299f-4452-b536-659e4803d33a"}],"objectId":"66f66177fdbe831edead3c62","doi":"10.1016/j.gr.2024.06.020","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1342937X24002041?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The impact of China’s booming tech sector on environmental sustainability: An analysis through comprehensive CS-ARDL approach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"China’s rapid technological advancement and the growth of its tech sector have raised concerns about their impact on environmental sustainability. The current analysis aims to contribute to the existing literature by offering a fresh perspective on China’s environmental sustainability, as the existing literature tends to overlook the role of the size of the technological market, which is closely connected with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—SDG 7, SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 12 and SDG 13. China can make significant strides towards achieving these goals by harnessing the potential of the technological market and aligning it with environmental sustainability objectives. This study also investigates the roles of urbanization and economic growth and examines the existence of the inverted N-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis in 31 Chinese provinces from 2004 to 2021. Robust tests are employed to analyse the data, including the Cointegrated Structural Auto Regressive Distributed Lag approach (CS-ARDL) and the Augmented Mean Group(AMG) method. The results indicate that economic growth, urbanization, and the size of the technological market can reduce SO2 emissions, demonstrating a positive environmental impact through China’s inverted N-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve. Additionally, the Dumitrescu-Hurlin Granger causality test showed evidence of bidirectional causality between the size of the technological market and SO2 emissions. Based on the findings, the study proposes sustainable development policies for China, in line with the SDG targets. In this context, the country’s rapid economic growth and strategies for industrial competitiveness need reassessment. The objective should be to redesign these strategies to increase the proportion of high-tech activities in overall manufacturing and promote the adoption of renewable energy in the country’s total energy consumption. Consequently, Chinese policymakers should prioritize the implementation of regulations that uphold fundamental principles to enhance environmental quality while maintaining rapid economic growth and a competitive advantage in the industrial sector."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a04739734f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"134","pagesFromTo":"245-261","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f66177fdbe831edead3c63","66f66177fdbe831edead3c64","5e709285878c28a04739734f","66f66177fdbe831edead3c65"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e64","mniswId":"7300","title":"Gondwana Research","issn":"1342-937X","eissn":"1878-0571","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"0411b8cf-f4e9-416a-9ba4-2ce6e8669743"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66eaeb9ffdbe836650b214c6","year":"2024","volume":"134","documentHash":"cbdaa431-ee5c-40f8-a295-5dde8e4a684c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["environmental sustainability"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059772898"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6344d52a7523402e341121e5","name":"ARKADIUSZ","lastName":"PUSZKAREK","uuid":"66790B9ED129B39315A98A8E7DABD879DEFA406F587E2281A355BCBE85F746A04D376B39957339C7F194ED40314B23F881DE6A2FEDDA2044A4106D8E9787E6F0","documentHash":"bfe38391-88b8-4400-92a7-c12452219488"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397275","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"KOZAK","uuid":"6686F8D2AE6BEC141649DA7093335B0B2837BDE8ADAAEA334F02AC73C33CD43BDABAEF1350DBE6098DB83B1B6950F00829B7B2941CAD447337B4CEF4AF3B0109","orcidId":"0000-0002-0062-1590","documentHash":"f563722f-8d8b-42f0-8e8b-d2225ee9ca9d"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739722d","name":"LECH","lastName":"DOROBCZYŃSKI","uuid":"C288151E46DB81947D7A8C31B905BC563750794556E56A43E4ACF1C623ADE8A5D7DACF8CB564F2BF341AAB62B4732C2E2AE86FEF20E3F1872FA8DF25A3DC4B41","orcidId":"0000-0001-8388-8700","documentHash":"37c0d642-f93b-40a4-94f1-fc71b0a3a24e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"66f55079fdbe83204d9c65d6","doi":"10.3390/en17174453","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/17/4453/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Main Ships Propulsion Boiler Control and Hardware-in-Loop Model Implementation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article presents the issues related to the operation and modelling of a ship’s main propulsion steam boiler. Such objects are used widely in seagoing ships, especially very large crude oil carriers, as a main propulsion turbine feed. The advantages, along with the simple construction, thus greatly improve reliability making oil feed boilers an excellent source of power for the chosen types of large ships. It is worth mentioning that a vast part of the research work was performed in previous years regarding automatic control of boiler automation, but, since then, this technology has not been the focus of the researchers. Due to the fact that there is little information available on algorithms for controlling ship boilers, in the presented article, the authors created a unique solution for the control system of a propulsion boiler. The proposed control algorithm takes into account the operating parameters of the ship and allows for quick implementation in a simulation system working in a hardware loop, which can be used for quick testing of solutions for boiler systems fed with alternative fuels. In the future, fossil fuels will become less important than they are now, but the control techniques of boilers will eventually change due to different fuel parameters and, therefore, the development of such boilers is necessary. This article presents the results of research collected in real ship boilers during their operation and, based on the results, a digital model of such an object along with the necessary controls was created. This model was implemented into Hardware-In-Loop, which is the initial step for preparing the full model (including sensors, etc.) of a steam-heated boiler. The theoretical background, along with the chosen simulation and experimental results of control implemented into HIL, are presented to validate assumptions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w

structure of beryllium limiters used in JET with the ITER-like wall (ILW) during the first (ILW1), third (ILW3) and all three (ILW1-3) campaigns were examined and evaluated. Tritium was deposited on the surfaces inside the castellation grooves together with deuterium, beryllium, oxygen, carbon and small amounts of metallic impurities such as nickel, copper and tungsten. The tritium content after the ILW1 campaign was greater than after the ILW3 campaign. This is attributed to the steadily decreasing amount of carbon impurities in JET from campaign to campaign. The majority of tritium was retained in shallow regions in the grooves, up to 2 mm from the entrance to the gap. It was comparable on all sides of the castellation, i.e. no difference has been detected between the toroidal and poloidal gaps. Secondly, the tritium retention in the gaps was similar on all specimens independent of their position in the tokamak, while the retention on the plasma-facing surfaces clearly depended on the tile position. The tritium deposition patterns in the castellation were also compared with the deuterium distribution determined in earlier studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"63","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"46023","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b8714","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b8715","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b8716","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b8717","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b8718","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b8719","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b871a","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b871b","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b871c","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b871d","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b871e","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b871f","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b8720","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b8721","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b8722","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b8723","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b8724","66fd223dfdbe836fcb7b8725","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"NUCLEAR FUSION","doi":"10.1088/issn.0029-5515","issn":"0029-5515","documentHash":"88422204-97ec-4fb6-bc55-866a72c6c2e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fd1f67fdbe836fcb7b43a2","year":"2023","volume":"63","number":"4","documentHash":"4605455e-4c90-45e8-b48d-60c480b5a606"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059777086"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a849b","name":"KONRAD","lastName":"MAROSEK","uuid":"BC9B7967F0211A591C992BE16BF47863C4D9D0719F69B51F32E5FCA0CE327C61F7E4DA981387A875E87B553DCE52222715F100AEC16723160EF5B0C73E70ED77","orcidId":"0000-0002-5681-8245","documentHash":"096d2981-1c4f-4438-b701-b72f2a28da03"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397211","name":"KONRAD","lastName":"ĆWIRKO","uuid":"8E4EEAF257762DA811F1E90F131268C80533DE3E1BB3D8E7A6D0014AD0472085E5AE0AD4D31202F1E90696CFE55331DB576614776145FFE6F7B5ED785F20F76C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2231-9533","documentHash":"73dac506-0bb5-4880-b905-36889ef1bfb4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"66fd176bfdbe836fcb7ad875","doi":"10.3390/en17194908","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/19/4908/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Analytical Method for Determining the Viscosity Index of Engine Lubricating Oils","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper proposes a simple analytical method for determining the viscosity index (VI) that effectively aligns with results obtained from the applicable standards. This method simply needs the kinematic viscosity of the tested oil at 40 and 100 °C as input parameters and does not need to use tables that are an integral part of the mentioned standards. This work presents a method and evaluates the accuracy of determining auxiliary parameters in the form of kinematic viscosity values at 40 °C for two hypothetical oils. These oils have a kinematic viscosity at 100 °C equal to that of the oil under testing and have VI = 0 and 100. The relative fitting error percentage and the coefficient of determination are found for the specified auxiliary indicators. The method is validated using data obtained from previous studies in the form of the kinematic viscosity of lubricating oil–diesel mixtures. The mixtures of viscosity grades SAE 30 and SAE 40 lubricating oil with diesel oil at concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50% w/w are tested. The viscosity index for each mixture is determined using a standard-based manual calculation using the Anton Paar viscosity index calculator and the proposed method. The results obtained from the proposed analytical method are compared with those from two other methods. The maximum percentage relative fitting error (δmax≈ 1%) and the coefficient of determination (R2 > 0.999) are determined. The obtained results demonstrate a very good fit and, thus, confirm the usefulness of the proposed approach."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c8","5e70935e878c28a0473a849b","5e709284878c28a047397211","5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"4908","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245","5e709285878c28a0473972c8","5e709284878c28a047397211","5e70935e878c28a0473a849b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fd176bfdbe836fcb7ad876","year":"2024","volume":"17","number":"19","documentHash":"9dcad991-6c59-45c1-91d8-163286b133dc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["lubricating oil","viscosity index","kinematic viscosity","viscosity variation with temperature","analytical algorithm"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059777407"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397272","name":"ALEKSANDRA","lastName":"ŁAPKO","uuid":"AFE1174BBB371C6ABD9C370F9797DA40368D7E7C34C5CF7FB3DFB719F331E631C4775DC6D3DC5332773B607803D17C71076EBCF7FAFF6B357EC51A2E03727811","orcidId":"0000-0003-0235-6329","documentHash":"0f57227e-e7bb-45d9-998f-f541d49c789a"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397225","name":"EWA","lastName":"HĄCIA","uuid":"F42EF81ABD18219FD25F57CC9992D41257D9428883BBECDB1AF297E85BE5039D4C2C964CD231EA0AC7F4966F664185E1C57DAB5B620CB42A0ADE13BEECD6C5ED","orcidId":"0000-0003-4865-7901","documentHash":"37e25853-a96f-487f-8acf-092b7c9404f6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6700e42efdbe8378ce1c93dd","publicUri":"https://repository.am.szczecin.pl/handle/123456789/2836","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Changes in the development of tourism in Polish port cities as a challenge to the planning of city logistics","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study discusses the results of research into changes in the tourist traffic in port cities, which may pose challenges to the planning of city logistics. The analysis draws on the statistical data on tourism.

Covering the years 1995–2022, the analysis has been complemented with a review of the literature on the role of city logistics in solving problems caused by the development of tourism. The rapid growth of tourism generates an increased flow of people, goods, and information, which may be detrimental to the smooth functioning of a city. Insights into the development of tourist traffic over the years may facilitate the planning of city logistics and reconcile the function of a tourist destination with that of a port, which the cities have to perform.

The dock is designed for operation in a river canal. In order to dock a ship, it is moved away from the quay over a dock trench. Initial requirements and design criteria for the system were determined. The most important of them include docking in the maximum weather conditions, corresponding to a wind speed of 5° Beaufort (5°B), and a zero-emission target for the power supply system (use of a renewable energy source). A wire and winch system was designed to move the dock and stabilise it in position during docking operations. The system comprises mooring wires which are tied to bollards on both quays, and wire winches mounted on both sides of the dock. The wire winches are hydraulically driven, and the hydraulic pumps, run by electric motors, are powered with batteries charged using photovoltaic panels. Statistical environmental parameters (wind, river current) were analysed and the probability of certain mooring wire loads and the corresponding wire winch power output were quantified. Based on these calculations, the power of photovoltaic panels and capacity of the batteries required to power the dock moving system were determined. This paper discusses the system design as well as the results of trials."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a5e6","5e709285878c28a0473972c9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"4331","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972c9","5e7092ac878c28a04739a5e6","66eefba6fdbe834dc425b6c6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":"10.3390/en","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"073c6b4f-b994-4710-8065-02d74e1e73ce"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66cdaa7ffdbe832737eec426","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"17","documentHash":"cf5ba151-f0e4-45a9-9c4f-e2e0a1fcc0b1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mobile floating dock","effect of hydrological and meteorological parameters on a dock"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059783788"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66eef3c7fdbe834dc4258f29","name":"Adrianna","lastName":"Łobodzińska","documentHash":"5845a949-5f28-4078-8525-e04c90e2ee79"},{"objectId":"66eef3c7fdbe834dc4258f28","name":"Tymoteusz","lastName":"Miller","documentHash":"653caf2e-1799-4027-984e-bbf24ad2176d"},{"objectId":"6268aaaa7523406b88cecdd6","name":"IRMINA","lastName":"DURLIK","uuid":"97E8690FCCEC355A0AAFB8F87B0FEFE701AE794CFC914CFAA68B463BCCA8D602B65F1A5FF5EF6A118E8D18C82B226D18DA0979BB186B77ACD599A2B5CCA232CB","orcidId":"0000-0002-9684-072X","documentHash":"a137326d-8152-4450-84a6-0286aaf7dd28"},{"objectId":"602f697d9543c7410626f451","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Kostecka","uuid":"FAE53E36C71E8923119AB6D89173C662086FA2DD2608FD7E31A8C3666677341813238759D174B2137EF28B374924B62E9809C7F32662F65A42523967BDD92095","orcidId":"0009-0006-5357-6531","documentHash":"db446977-45e0-46ed-b86a-5a86a1b9bf9e"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739721b","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"BORKOWSKI","uuid":"687492162CB4DEED79E55C9C326215141175656F5AE1722E42E7DAB360479A3017246094E4C445AC3FD5BCF6BA2F3648A7D7484A707479D4D26908D204EEB13C","orcidId":"0000-0001-5278-0633","documentHash":"fb650cab-7fb7-47f5-9898-c90d30515163"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"66eef3c7fdbe834dc4258f27","doi":"10.3390/electronics13183660","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/18/3660","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A Critical AI View on Autonomous Vehicle Navigation: The Growing Danger","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent a transformative advancement in transportation technology, promising to enhance travel efficiency, reduce traffic accidents, and revolutionize our road systems. Central to the operation of AVs is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), which enables these vehicles to navigate complex environments with minimal human intervention. This review critically examines the potential dangers associated with the increasing reliance on AI in AV navigation. It explores the current state of AI technologies, highlighting key techniques such as machine learning and neural networks, and identifies significant challenges including technical limitations, safety risks, and ethical and legal concerns.

The scientific aim of this article was to simultaneously cover three areas, innovation, business models, and sustainable development, to develop a scheme enabling the construction of rankings of the elements of these areas in a version dedicated to software producing companies. Rankings, which are built using the hybrid Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method, indicate to decision-makers the need for building strategic development plans, which aspects are the most important, and what the order of possible implementations should be. Based on a multi-criteria analysis, it was found that (i) in terms of innovation, companies should focus their attention first on implementing product, process, and technological innovations; (ii) within innovative business models, attempts should be made to produce IT systems using virtualization and dockerization, as well as efforts should be made to closely bind customers with the offered products and services and offer temporary rental of IT systems instead of classic licenses; and (iii) in the context of the classic three levels of sustainable development, companies should focus primarily on economic and financial issues."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"5871","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"46882d20-8996-4dde-bd15-7d5f8ecc797a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"669104f9fdbe835273b05d02","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"14","documentHash":"795ecdec-2b49-49dd-a854-a05f6f81b815"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["business models","sustainable innovations","hybrid MCDM","software companies"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059784254"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66eefe46fdbe834dc425d60f","name":"Mykhaylo","lastName":"Shuper","documentHash":"57656e0c-191f-4aae-ab0e-5d94814ebb75"},{"objectId":"5e7093ba878c28a0473afdae","name":"EWELINA","lastName":"ORYSIAK","uuid":"A71328D1BE89E55D147DD48C1C89CF9DD84DEDED655937317F03219368A9A268ED8D580F0DF791AF0C98C1A118ECC3323F9CB080707CE6A5392C202D5D878DE3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4270-1764","documentHash":"cd165605-2e0a-4ede-afb7-0539df79b514"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"66eefe46fdbe834dc425d60e","doi":"10.3390/en17174414","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/17/4414/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Determination of Demand for LNG in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study was aimed at improving the energy efficiency of the distribution of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as shipping fuel in the southern Baltic Sea. The objective of this study was to determine the demand for LNG for maritime shipping by analyzing the distribution of the resource from the water side (ship-to-ship). LNG was chosen due to the location of the LNG terminal in Świnoujście within the analyzed water area, where a problem has arisen in the southern part of the Baltic Sea regarding fuel supply for vessels due to the lack of developed infrastructure along the coast. An analysis was conducted to optimize the size of the LNG fleet and infrastructure facilities. Seeking compliance with Annex VI to the MARPOL 73/78 Convention, adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), shipowners see potential in the switch from conventional fuels to LNG. As one of the alternative solutions, it will contribute to reducing harmful emissions. Determination of the LNG distribution volume requires the identification of LNG storage facility locations, specifying the number of LNG-powered ships (broken down by type) and the number of LNG bunkering ships. The first part of this study contains a detailed analysis of the number of sea-going ships that provide services in the southern part of the Baltic Sea and the world’s number of LNG bunkering ships. The database contains a set of the characteristics required to determine the optimal demand for LNG, where LNG bunkering vessels are capable of supplying fuel within the shortest possible time and covering the shortest possible distance to LNG-powered ships. The characteristics include the type of ship, requested LNG volume, the speed of LNG bunkering ships, the distance between LNG facilities, and the loading rate (the volume of fuel received per time unit). Based on the collected data, the volume of LNG distribution was determined using MATLAB R2019a software. The remainder of this study contains a description of the conducted research and results of an analysis of the traffic density in the Baltic Sea. The results were obtained on the basis of data from the Statistical Yearbook of Maritime Economy and IALA IWRAP Mk2 2020 software. The number of LNG-powered ships and number of LNG bunkering ships were specified, and the demand for LNG for the area under analysis was determined."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ba878c28a0473afdae"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"4414","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ba878c28a0473afdae","66eefe46fdbe834dc425d60f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":"10.3390/en","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"073c6b4f-b994-4710-8065-02d74e1e73ce"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66cdaa7ffdbe832737eec426","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"17","documentHash":"cf5ba151-f0e4-45a9-9c4f-e2e0a1fcc0b1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["logistics","transport safety","shipping fuel","exploitation process modeling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059784348"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc84c","name":"JACEK","lastName":"WOJNOWSKI","uuid":"4F9B693399CAF82E1420F421CCD44308A476153B3E161E72283BAB15771E3A0B5B25CE2167A4399FB1FA6CC23CF25A47D933E94FA507125B55CCC0E3DF696053","orcidId":"0000-0002-5880-3506","documentHash":"6899096c-dddf-4481-8a25-1406f5904f57"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a453","name":"REMIGIUSZ","lastName":"IWAŃKOWICZ","uuid":"7E72EB92EA2B10A18CCBB0FABE13B1A417C851F3E0FB087CD46DCB39091578238D1B4AAFF828CB86864713B5A57724DA435B52086FC9608741256797743E5851","orcidId":"0000-0002-6018-6682","documentHash":"46604068-2afa-4cd8-b224-493dd8238305"}],"objectId":"671b749efdbe8340f26f5ed0","publicUri":"https://zij.edu.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Wojnowski.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Identyfikacja warunków uruchomienia produkcji masowej wyrobów elastomerowych przy użyciu technologii przyrostowych","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Technologie przyrostowe (AM) są gałęzią wytwarzania części maszyn i wyrobów funkcjonalnych, która rozwija się w bardzo szybkim tempie.

This article explores optimizing bulk carrier fleets for transporting polymetallic nodules (PMNs) from the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) to reduce CO2 emissions. Our analysis shows that larger bulk carriers, despite greater drifting forces from environmental conditions, emit less CO2 over the entire transport mission, including loading and transit. Deploying large ships in global maritime trade could significantly reduce CO2 emissions. This study also introduces a novel artificial neural network (ANN) model to estimate drifting forces during loading operations and proposes a new method for estimating CO2 emissions, considering environmental conditions and ship seakeeping properties.

Its goal is to reduce the carbon footprint and increase a ship’s maneuverability, operational safety, and reliability. The high requirements for ship propulsion make permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) an attractive solution due to their characteristics. This paper discusses the control problem of a PMSM based on the input–output feedback linearization method combined with the optimal and adaptive control techniques. The method presented here integrates the parameter tuning process with the optimal design of the baseline controller. Since the load disturbances are treated as an additional unknown parameter, there is no need to introduce an integral action to deal with the resulting steady-state error. An important feature of the designed controller is the so-called energetic optimization of the system; i.e., in addition to the aforementioned adaptive and optimal controller, it has a feature of ensuring zero reactive power consumed by the system. The performed simulations of the machine speed stabilization process confirmed the high efficiency of the proposed controller despite the assumed uncertainty of the system parameters and environmental (load) disturbances. Besides achieving high-quality control, an essential feature of this approach is the elimination of the tuning problem."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972d9","5e709285878c28a0473972d6","5e709284878c28a047397278"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"2178","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972d6","5e709285878c28a0473972d9","5e709284878c28a047397278"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"662b490340970762633e8ef3","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"9","documentHash":"240aee71-7f05-4a5f-9600-fe8282633a37"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["adaptive control","energy efficiency","PM SM","control system design","optimal control"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059831130"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c3354f9543c723365440f6","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Korlak","uuid":"A53088D8FA90F5AA22075FC239FA25D53D60CCFEBB7E31DF90D61C07FED1BAE9592ECCC5BF33EFE110137E5814CF3A1DD5A3B75BC09AC7A4B73001C747443831","orcidId":"0000-0002-4548-4796","documentHash":"f16cc5aa-2018-4c95-a16e-32618eec924a"},{"objectId":"5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f93","name":"EWELINA","lastName":"ZŁOCZOWSKA","uuid":"18EB1AD75BF693447193D1EAFCA2FFFBF2B9B79268211F05110B1613F237AEFB256FE8BD75738419997C75C7C51CD8608929C51DF4307181DE845548ED52D801","orcidId":"0000-0003-0493-6562","documentHash":"27c0b135-65ae-47ac-a920-9e000be3ae8e"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397215","name":"CEZARY","lastName":"BEHRENDT","uuid":"C7460767A0FD33C8E5C7ACE46EBD2FE218FC2DE163B06D3F7F7D439414769B361B4A2631DC9767205C89C1BEF75B440756927BB9E0665476285678C7DD3814BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1403-4802","documentHash":"f8f35665-07fc-4471-92bd-1565eb2e7cda"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2024-09-26","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"66f53e73fdbe83204d9bc568","doi":"10.1016/j.egyr.2024.09.026","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484724006024","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Utilization of waste heat and cold on the example of an LNG-fueled ultra-large container ship","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Increasingly stringent requirements for ship energy efficiency measured in CO2 emissions per ton-mile are introduced to decarbonize shipping. Because using liquefied natural gas as the least=emission fossil fuel per unit of energy doesn’t meet the CO2 reduction target and the implementation of low-speed engines powered by alternative zero-carbon fuels is in the state of research and development, as well as the application of wind-assisted propulsion remaining ruled out for ultra-large container ships (ULCS) for construction reasons, it becomes necessary to apply deep utilization of waste heat from exhaust gas, jacket cooling water, scavenge air, and cold from LNG regasification in the electricity generation process. The utilization of waste heat and cold from all available carriers will allow the production of an increased amount of steam to power the steam turbine generators, which, when the ship's electricity demand is covered, makes it possible to switch off diesel generators. As a result, the ship's fuel consumption and emissions of harmful substances will decrease. The authors developed the concept of a waste heat and cold recovery system for all available carriers, combining the gas cycle with a two-stage cascade organic Rankine cycle. The operation of the proposed waste heat and cold recovery system was simulated using Aspen Plus software. The calculations revealed that up to 5832 kW of electric power is achievable, which corresponds to 12.18 % of the main engine brake power. This performance ensures a reduction in the attained EEDI and EEXI values of the CMA CGM Jacques Saade by up to 17 %, which is not achievable with conventional waste heat recovery systems utilizing only a part of the exhaust gas and scavenge air streams."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397215","60c3354f9543c723365440f6","5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f93"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"3488-3503","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c3354f9543c723365440f6","5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f93","5e709284878c28a047397215"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c01a","mniswId":"5687","title":"Energy Reports","issn":"2352-4847","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"099cceb2-2179-426e-8bbd-54253cc964e4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f53e73fdbe83204d9bc569","year":"2024","volume":"12","documentHash":"abcf2f19-ae42-4f67-8322-d14551da4214"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["decarbonization","EEDI","EEXI","electricity generation","waste heat and cold recovery"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059831674"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6718f49dfdbe8353f76071db","name":"Liudmyla","lastName":"Davydenko","documentHash":"7f8e084f-77df-4df0-95ca-93e6377612e0"},{"objectId":"6718f49dfdbe8353f76071da","name":"Ihor","lastName":"Petrov","documentHash":"baed1f70-eae5-4e3a-8668-8e7f24fd147f"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b79a4","name":"TYGRAN","lastName":"DZHUGURYAN","uuid":"9B3C485FE0AB0118D31378D7FB4E7386A88527266EDE5306E9D7A659BE0C1295055C00B7ECDB9A602FC38400C04E0F436D373D3D608E7FC5438F0484CD3AA38E","orcidId":"0000-0001-5613-9448","documentHash":"75806eb5-0e6b-4d8d-a1e8-83c6e015c4ac"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a5f80","name":"SYLWIA","lastName":"MIELNICZUK","uuid":"73A3B163A34553B8F9894C95EEBE66E994A8E49E47B3C7F5ECBA25EF32D50F394FD04A8EAA759930E4476EFF268B8EEF9E8244AF0618D2C8CAB38422FC4DD9C9","orcidId":"0000-0002-9568-5633","documentHash":"1c380b4c-ffbc-4c5f-ae5d-928c20446ecb"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972de","name":"BOGUSZ","lastName":"WIŚNICKI","uuid":"FDB4CE7E72F1233633E17C80AF596BB2C76676FBEAB8CE0D22254723C9CF4EE0CE9F5024F91CEB5BA04CB2F9901A2AADCE8AABDF77DBA594304D915A812EFAB0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2932-8969","documentHash":"2367c965-7bc4-4748-bbe7-1d8d418a1b10"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6718f49dfdbe8353f76071d8","doi":"10.3390/su16208801","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/20/8801/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A Decision Support Model for Lean Supply Chain Management in City Multifloor Manufacturing Clusters","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"City manufacturing has once again become one of the priority areas for the sustainable development of smart cities thanks to the use of a wide range of green technologies and, first of all, additive technologies. Shortening the supply chain between producers and consumers has significant effects on economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Zoning of city multifloor manufacturing (CMFM) in areas with a compact population in large cities in the form of clusters with their own city logistics nodes (CLNs) creates favorable conditions for promptly meeting the needs of citizens for goods of everyday demand and for passenger and freight transportation. City multifloor manufacturing clusters (CMFMCs) have been already studied quite a lot for their possible uses; nevertheless, an identified research gap is related to supply chain design efficiency concerning CMFMCs. Thus, the main objective of this study was to explore the possibilities of lean supply chain management (LSCM) as the integrated application of lean manufacturing (LM) approaches and I4.0 technologies for customer-centric value stream management based on eliminating all types of waste, reducing the use of natural and energy resources, and continuous improvement of processes related to logistics activities. This paper presents a decision support model for LSCM in CMFMCs, which is a mathematical deterministic model. This model justifies the minimization of the number of road transport transfers within the urban area and the amount of stock that is stored in CMFMC buildings and in CLNs, and also regulating supplier lead time. The model was verified and validated using appropriately selected test data based on the case study, which was designed as a typical CMFM manufacturing system with various parameters of CMFMCs and urban freight transport frameworks. The feasibility of using the proposed model for value stream mapping (VSM) and managing logistics processes and inventories in clusters is discussed. The findings can help decisionmakers and researchers improve the planning and management of logistics processes and inventory in clusters, even in the face of unexpected disruptions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942c878c28a0473b79a4","5e709285878c28a0473972de","5e709344878c28a0473a5f80"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"8801","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972de","5e70942c878c28a0473b79a4","5e709344878c28a0473a5f80","6718f49dfdbe8353f76071da","6718f49dfdbe8353f76071db"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec0064fad49b31cced97ee1","title":"Sustainability","doi":"10.3390/su","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","documentHash":"eb388892-6801-4141-aec4-18c5219948bd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6718f49dfdbe8353f76071d9","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"20","documentHash":"34ff3808-4104-4bb7-b07e-38636bfa8b6a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["city logistics","supply chain management","sustainability","transportation","learn manufacturing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059868178"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0eef","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Banaszek","uuid":"3ECE94A07856F22640FD4A6C73781FB3A9283F94B0B69424DD75C9ACDA19428D69C487E5D73A500C0B5A640E8FCD3FBFE8703BE779EBC26501B039E36D5EAF18","orcidId":"0000-0003-1285-329X","documentHash":"54a0808f-ae7b-45a7-8174-e645ea357823"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397268","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"LISAJ","uuid":"45193735E1766EF5D07F06E9066788B0E8EB2276921D491633322481134DF902C9A2EB07C8ADD53EF3D10D4198AAE0C305BBE634CE47AAC73A68634A8FDB6FF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-7390-425X","documentHash":"a71a51ed-c161-4647-b72f-097921dad8e6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-11-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6756e947fdbe833c07e8b6de","doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2024.09.490","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1877050924025353?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The concept of using of neural network computer systems to assist establish Radiocommunications in Distress situations for captains of tourist yachts sailing around the Lesser Antilles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Lesser Antilles Sea Area is a particularly dangerous area for small unconventional, including, tourist sea yachts because the range of available communications in the areas of communication zones A1 and A2, is severely limited there. This represents a significant constraint on the safety of navigation for these vessels because in a dangerous situation requiring a call for RCC assistance, the use of common VHF/MF radio equipment for this purpose is limited and often ineffective. The ability to contact Maritime Rescue Coordination Centers in case of danger to life and property on a yacht is an important issue. Recently, there has been an increased number of serious maritime accidents involving cruising sea yachts, during which there have been serious problems in establishing radio communication in dangerous situations. The article presents the concept of an intelligent radio communication system to support the decision of the captain of a small sea tourist yacht, sailing in the waters near Lesser Antilles, in a dangerous situation requiring a call for RCC assistance. The discussed new system, based on the method of artificial neural networks ANN, makes it possible to help the captain make the right navigation decision in an emergency situation. The content presents the calculation model and an example of numerical simulation of the operation of the described decision support system, with reference to the existing communication areas A1, A2 Lesser Antilles area and assuming a given position of a tourist small yacht in a dangerous situation, requiring a call for RCC assistance by means of VHF/MF radio equipment. The result of the simulation is the calculation of the distance to the nearest area to establish communication with the Maritime Rescue Coordination Center and the value of the new corrected course of the tourist yacht and the estimation of the time required to reach the aforementioned area."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397268"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"246","pagesFromTo":"714-723","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574195a","mniswId":"1113","fullName":"International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems","shortName":"KES","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"bb65bc19-2aab-4b61-9a0e-d6b41e5b1e74"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"674dbb38fdbe8324c66cf254","startDate":"2024-09-11","endDate":"2024-09-13","fullName":"28th International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems (KES 2024)","shortName":"KES 2024","city":"Sevilla","country":"ES","website":"http://kes2024.kesinternational.org/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"88ec3a20-c57a-4f4e-af08-c271f6c6a78d"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709301878c28a0473a0eef","5e709284878c28a047397268"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e710e5046e0fb0001bb6a1d","title":"Procedia Computer Science","eissn":"1877-0509","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/procedia-computer-science/","documentHash":"3c8e416f-2852-455f-83a1-3b8733fb1938"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674997c2fdbe8325166615b7","year":"2024","volume":"246","documentHash":"06538876-a98c-423b-a8a7-07ec387a900a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["neural network computer system","radio communication systems","distress situation","RCC","lesser antilles sea area","tourist yachts"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059982130"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"632e6ba97523402e340c0936","name":"JAN","lastName":"WYSOCKI","uuid":"64EE76EA7CD5D2F63D7A253B06F4A41FB120FD7586DDB4651E6B2ABD01B452500A92B9356A5D480A4DDF7AFFF412679650632AEC22050FD076D94F749B120BD8","orcidId":"0000-0002-7973-1388","documentHash":"1953138b-7bb7-4f34-92bc-6de3c70b5148"},{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e052497d","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"BROŻEK","uuid":"4635B57887278636145F7244DEB98B68F0D8FE6C5ADE495765BC130C7E90C26B200477CB06A9DD3CC11530816F9279B27C62568C179399FA5C4326B6AF52A668","orcidId":"0000-0002-5022-6492","documentHash":"520540ee-1ccc-4ca7-8403-81909f61e278"},{"objectId":"602f697d9543c7410626f451","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Kostecka","uuid":"FAE53E36C71E8923119AB6D89173C662086FA2DD2608FD7E31A8C3666677341813238759D174B2137EF28B374924B62E9809C7F32662F65A42523967BDD92095","orcidId":"0009-0006-5357-6531","documentHash":"db446977-45e0-46ed-b86a-5a86a1b9bf9e"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7e3c","name":"MAREK","lastName":"STAUDE","uuid":"C111C8CA6533B2647002880B562141DEAD14395B57FF3B9D09357EB6F74F323B319D535C3D658840D78D30D641C7E91996F8509C9F54EA19BC24910C56FAC6A4","orcidId":"0000-0002-6773-1962","documentHash":"d486f289-2eb5-4b88-a10a-b82fb14171a6"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972d9","name":"DARIUSZ","lastName":"TARNAPOWICZ","uuid":"B2F02446E4E95D09304ED7E7491C0B7D2AE99EB31D6FF1BF764F887969968F5FBF2DC02529ABCC9FF3FEAFF38527EFCA11C2110CDDC46DE85D51FAD2569698E7","orcidId":"0000-0002-9456-2316","documentHash":"9dd63c94-31b7-4b82-a056-3203ea65be2a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6756dd08fdbe833c07e7cac5","doi":"10.3390/app142311406","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/23/11406","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Remote Water Quality Monitoring System for Use in Fairway Applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the context of climate change, there is a growing need for accurate, real-time data on water quality in river waterways.

Despite this, many decide to build their competitive position on the basis of marketing communications about sustainability practices. This paper investigates the landscape of sustainability communications practices within ferry operators in the Baltic Sea Region. The authors have developed an index based on two sources of information: (1) an expert assessment of sustainability categories built on the basis of the SDGs, and (2) an assessment of marketing communications of ferry companies. The results of the study identified three distinct patterns of conduct. An analysis revealed that voyage safety and greenhouse gas emissions are the two categories which the ferry companies are most committed to. The results show that marketing communications on the realisation of social goals gives way to that on commitment to the realisation of environmental goals. Beyond insights into the ferry market, the study presents a valuable methodological tool for assessing sustainability communications across diverse industries."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397272","5e709285878c28a0473972c7","5e709302878c28a0473a105b","5e709284878c28a047397225"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"e0312767","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972c7","5e709284878c28a047397272","5e709284878c28a047397225","5e709302878c28a0473a105b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","issn":"1932-6203","eissn":"1932-6203","documentHash":"fcfcc06e-e7b2-4412-a89f-df94326b9f49"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6756e777fdbe833c07e88f41","year":"2024","volume":"19","number":"12","documentHash":"59fd0904-a785-485a-8729-dcf425cad774"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["marketing communications","ferry companies"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060030378"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6756f179fdbe833c07e98068","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wiktorowska-Jasik","documentHash":"b91b1c92-1597-460f-ad7a-acd322123ad1"},{"objectId":"615fad2875234017e0505d6f","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Baszak","uuid":"59BEE8C67DCA6D908CD74F3DC92CB88554FBBA90960DA31F0A4F0E90377C2CA68A114EA4F90C74DFAAC1CCE87074649CF6D081FBB555DF3121BD80112226BBAF","documentHash":"4b744189-7b54-41ca-a7ae-6a3774ab87f4"},{"objectId":"5f8528b6085dcb410a25ed2b","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"SMACKI","uuid":"FFEE2B32C24B2890BE80F2062D6BC7C8A7BCF2A5C35974170BFE96A80A75DBC94D0C20994950AD2030AC38CE201E4E83423F9D2F86D6A8B9162896CFE3F69D32","orcidId":"0000-0003-3095-9354","documentHash":"535c9341-8f0c-447a-a085-a451c83661dd"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a489","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kaup","uuid":"C7F6842B24AE7D851F746BB317ABD52367EC9B1CC6B9DC784405E574DA9ED7375446845C4B5D17E7606D6CCAAE8E648B9B63E7267FBFCF47422FA0035E2E2F7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9384-8144","documentHash":"488c8c4d-34b8-4f07-9c8f-5bbc32d1ed8a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-11-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6756f179fdbe833c07e98067","doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2024.09.699","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1877050924027595?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Information systems and technologies supporting decision-making processes in logistics companies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents selected information systems and technologies supporting management and decision-making processes in logistics companies.

The expert research that has been carried out is intended, among other things, to demonstrate the risks faced by offshore wind farms in which autonomous ships will be used. Currently, increased traffic on wind farms contributes to an increase in the number of collisions or accidents. It is particularly important to look for solutions that allow for a quick response and appropriate planning of actions to minimizes hazards, which will consequently increase the safety of offshore wind farms.

This is an important issue due to the fact that yachts and smaller vessels are often equipped with VHF radios with limited range (for 25-35 Mm). In an distress situation, especially when life and property on a yacht are at risk, calling for RCC assistance using ordinary VHF/MF radio equipment is limited. In such a case, the most important thing is to be able to contact Marine Rescue Centers as soon as possible. The article presents the concept of a model of an intelligent system to assist the captain to facilitate the rapid establishment of communication via the VHF radiostation and develop a proper navigation decision based on the ANN artificial neural network method to call for RCC assistance in a distress situation. The article presents an example of numerical simulation of the operation of the discussed Radio Communication Decision Support system, assuming a certain position of a sea yacht in distress, with reference to existing sea corridors in the Pacific Ocean area. The result of the simulation is related to the calculation of the distance and the value of the new corrected Yacht course to the nearest sea corridor, where it is possible with high probability to meet another larger vessel and by way of establishing VHF radio contact with it achieve the establishment of communication with the marine Rescue Center to distress call."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397268"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"246","pagesFromTo":"433-442","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574195a","mniswId":"1113","fullName":"International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems","shortName":"KES","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"bb65bc19-2aab-4b61-9a0e-d6b41e5b1e74"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"674dbb38fdbe8324c66cf254","startDate":"2024-09-11","endDate":"2024-09-13","fullName":"28th International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems (KES 2024)","shortName":"KES 2024","city":"Sevilla","country":"ES","website":"http://kes2024.kesinternational.org/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"88ec3a20-c57a-4f4e-af08-c271f6c6a78d"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709301878c28a0473a0eef","5e709284878c28a047397268"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e710e5046e0fb0001bb6a1d","title":"Procedia Computer Science","eissn":"1877-0509","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/procedia-computer-science/","documentHash":"3c8e416f-2852-455f-83a1-3b8733fb1938"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674997c2fdbe8325166615b7","year":"2024","volume":"246","documentHash":"06538876-a98c-423b-a8a7-07ec387a900a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["VHR (Very High Resolution)","support decision system","radio communication systems","distress situation","RCC","small non-conventional vessel","far from shore"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060030894"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6756e3effdbe833c07e84e98","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Nowak","documentHash":"106d8674-608b-425a-bbe4-cdecb2685734"},{"objectId":"6756e3effdbe833c07e84e97","name":"Miłosz","lastName":"Raczyński","documentHash":"25ea93ce-7500-45e7-a6cf-0ef35d71f516"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a546","name":"RADOSŁAW","lastName":"RUTKOWSKI","uuid":"7F99F8449AD37AA6099F83B45C1EAAA681CA8B232EA0EDFE57AD1069A35B5788CDC2ED0F615FB0C66308AAA9D1F6E40C38C45CF759090CDE36E0749CC4397358","orcidId":"0000-0002-0067-6751","documentHash":"7d7c01f7-d42b-4148-bfc8-5e75f2193a3b"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a453","name":"REMIGIUSZ","lastName":"IWAŃKOWICZ","uuid":"7E72EB92EA2B10A18CCBB0FABE13B1A417C851F3E0FB087CD46DCB39091578238D1B4AAFF828CB86864713B5A57724DA435B52086FC9608741256797743E5851","documentHash":"46604068-2afa-4cd8-b224-493dd8238305"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6756e3effdbe833c07e84e96","doi":"10.3390/en17236150","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/23/6150","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Digital Twin in the Design and Dynamic Assessment of Energy Performance of Multi-Family Buildings","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article explores the potential of Digital Twin (DT) technology in the design and dynamic assessment of the energy performance of multi-family buildings. Traditional approaches to building energy assessment provide static data that do not account for changing operational conditions and lack continuous energy consumption-monitoring capabilities. The use of Digital Twin enables monitoring and analyzing of the building’s energy parameters at every stage of its life cycle. The article presents the application of DT technology for assessing energy performance at the conceptual stage and in the early phases of design. These parameters must meet legal requirements. Validation conducted on four multi-family buildings demonstrated high accuracy, with the average difference between predicted and actual energy performance (EP) values below 3.5%. Thanks to the DT model, it is possible to determine energy parameters already at the conceptual stage, which helps avoid costly changes in later project phases. Early determination of these parameters also allows for accurate estimation of design and investment costs. Tests of the proposed solution were conducted on several multi-family buildings, comparing preliminary data with final results. The research results show that DT technology allows for precise planning of energy performance at the conceptual and preliminary design stages. This reduces operational costs, increases energy efficiency, and better adapts buildings to changing technological and legal conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a546","5e7092ab878c28a04739a453"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"6150","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a546","6756e3effdbe833c07e84e97","5e7092ab878c28a04739a453","6756e3effdbe833c07e84e98"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67458308fdbe832eab8f02a4","year":"2024","volume":"17","number":"23","documentHash":"07250765-b035-4219-a84f-0df0eb040f81"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["design","energy efficiency","energy policy","management","digital twin","architecture"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060031039"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6758257bfdbe8357174dfde1","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Generowicz","documentHash":"f50c2b75-efa6-4db9-867f-cf56371ec0ac"},{"objectId":"6758257bfdbe8357174dfde0","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kowalski","documentHash":"96bd0714-f619-47d1-89fd-fe5efe068130"},{"objectId":"6758257bfdbe8357174dfddf","name":"Józef","lastName":"Ciuła","documentHash":"ef6b66ae-0d7c-49bd-a9b3-3058a7db09b5"},{"objectId":"5e709221878c28a04739051b","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Gaska","uuid":"98D91C4B85C7E9BAE59FA6BBC43583D6983B93A8A73DB09172AF6C47198B6F49EAC7A74BD86C5B47118623F0A6CA39D9E36D93B07FABD0587523D423762FBA4C","orcidId":"0000-0002-9369-6144","documentHash":"423e415e-2828-480c-8462-c57b77ac79e6"},{"objectId":"5e709220878c28a047390370","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Barbusiński","uuid":"596CC75C81F82FFE249D0290C8A33262B0020485241AF1D4E226E50C4DAB3D3602533B5F34C6C843BFE655B2F52705843E12732F6808B222588B66CC9F67A558","orcidId":"0000-0001-8718-6626","documentHash":"dbb83a09-db82-4c7c-b216-757ebd5402f4"},{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f5db","name":"ZBIGNIEW","lastName":"MATUSZAK","uuid":"79FF4750CEDCBED8184B9DEEC9D1866909AB3DFEF0280B4195035B33B2887CFC9C47CD503FF849D865899B1E9CF1DDBF8D74385A4710AABC7A38D2216F74CD79","orcidId":"0000-0002-0554-730X","documentHash":"1772d383-b930-4121-b854-c86fc297ad5e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63fe56dd4097071973654bd0","doi":"10.3390/en16052180","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/5/2180","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Analysis of energy generation efficiency and reliability of a cogeneration unit powered by biogas","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Landfill gas recovery and utilisation is a solution which reduces the adverse environmental impact of the landfill.

The tests were conducted on a three-axis direct-drive turning center. The holes were drilled in cylindrical PA6 aluminum alloy specimens 30 mm in length and 30 mm in diameter using 6 mm Ø VHM HPC TiAlN-coated twist drill bits. The cutting fluid was supplied to the cutting zone through the spindle. The experiments involved applying three strategies to drill deep through (5D) holes. The first required the workpiece to be fixed and the tool to perform both rotary and reciprocating motions. The second assumed that the workpiece performed the primary (rotary) motion whereas the tool moved in reciprocating motion. In the third strategy, the workpiece and the tool rotated in opposite directions and the tool also performed a reciprocating motion. The straightness, roundness, cylindricity, and diameter errors were the key output parameters in the analysis of the geometrical and dimensional accuracy of holes. The Taguchi orthogonal array design of experiment (DOE) was employed to determine the effects of the input (cutting) parameters (i.e., spindle speed and feed per revolution) and the type of hole making strategy on the hole errors by means of multi-factor statistical analysis ANOVA. The use of the highest spindle speed (n = 4775 rpm), the highest feed per revolution (𝑓𝑛\n = 0.14 mm/rev) and strategy I resulted in the lowest values of the output parameters (STR = 22.7 µm, RON = 8.6 µm, CYL = 28.2 µm, and DE = 9.9 µm). Strategy I was reported to be the most effective for hole drilling in PA6 aluminum alloy because, irrespective of the values of the process parameters used, three out of four output parameters, i.e., straightness, roundness and diameter errors, reached the lowest values."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a047397282"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709241878c28a0473929b8"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"110","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709241878c28a0473929b8","5e709285878c28a047397282","5e70941c878c28a0473b66da"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a60d8940970715e70ecb77","year":"2022","volume":"16","number":"1","documentHash":"11a92e97-0d7e-425d-bcef-02fe810a18c7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["drilling","drilling strategy","hole quality"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060034562"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b81ae","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"KALBARCZYK-JEDYNAK","uuid":"25AC1644194D3C29AEB2D0A88B383C512A96F8BF9EC0CA7C0C1C43B96DA14628AB75EB50E1627C982D1A1969BDD0E9B5AE95A55CD2E32F3899F2D6BC26FFE6CB","orcidId":"0000-0001-7513-4837","documentHash":"82d9c156-2ea0-41a5-bcd2-bf6a1919803b"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a489","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kaup","uuid":"C7F6842B24AE7D851F746BB317ABD52367EC9B1CC6B9DC784405E574DA9ED7375446845C4B5D17E7606D6CCAAE8E648B9B63E7267FBFCF47422FA0035E2E2F7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9384-8144","documentHash":"488c8c4d-34b8-4f07-9c8f-5bbc32d1ed8a"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972eb","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"ŚLĄCZKA","uuid":"759D7BBB207B434EFA81A5CA6F08F7D206BED69E025A0F821F004076FA7A0CDD9783E41F2B94B43A5AE5CF41E1690AD8A01EDD81784FB6469F9F64AD37799A08","orcidId":"0000-0003-3265-9726","documentHash":"c3a0236f-a4c1-4ffe-8618-771c3f20fc03"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-11-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6757f5c5fdbe835dc1624313","doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2024.09.705","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1877050924027650?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Decision making in the process of ensuring safety within seaport area","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article provides a comprehensive analysis of risks arising within seaport area, while simultaneously demonstrating modern techniques contributing to greater safety in seaport area.

The current dynamic development of digital technologies and their implementation in seaport areas pose new challenges to entities managing the sphere of cyber security, while at the same time they streamline decision-making processes, providing a complete overview of a situation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972eb","5e709434878c28a0473b81ae","5e7092ab878c28a04739a489"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"246","pagesFromTo":"5535-5544","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574195a","mniswId":"1113","fullName":"International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems","shortName":"KES","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"bb65bc19-2aab-4b61-9a0e-d6b41e5b1e74"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"674dbb38fdbe8324c66cf254","startDate":"2024-09-11","endDate":"2024-09-13","fullName":"28th International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems (KES 2024)","shortName":"KES 2024","city":"Sevilla","country":"ES","website":"http://kes2024.kesinternational.org/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"88ec3a20-c57a-4f4e-af08-c271f6c6a78d"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709434878c28a0473b81ae","5e7092ab878c28a04739a489","5e709285878c28a0473972eb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e710e5046e0fb0001bb6a1d","title":"Procedia Computer Science","eissn":"1877-0509","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/procedia-computer-science/","documentHash":"3c8e416f-2852-455f-83a1-3b8733fb1938"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674997c2fdbe8325166615b7","year":"2024","volume":"246","documentHash":"06538876-a98c-423b-a8a7-07ec387a900a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["decision making","safety","seaports"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060040926"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"675809d6fdbe835dc163df6d","name":"Roman","lastName":"Bronsky","documentHash":"66aa6110-dd40-4ee6-8405-6587afa02821"},{"objectId":"5e70941b878c28a0473b6467","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"MATUSZAK","uuid":"0A282DE15AC8F3E725A520A4E06F490DEB740A0DC1C75AE1D0089A1639E4FF2758F222AADE1EE8D413BF676D69DFF6B28853E329DEA35995A60BC8D819C5A0EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-1746-6814","documentHash":"be2b3398-97ad-4419-a769-3f2537fea721"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397275","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"KOZAK","uuid":"6686F8D2AE6BEC141649DA7093335B0B2837BDE8ADAAEA334F02AC73C33CD43BDABAEF1350DBE6098DB83B1B6950F00829B7B2941CAD447337B4CEF4AF3B0109","orcidId":"0000-0002-0062-1590","documentHash":"f563722f-8d8b-42f0-8e8b-d2225ee9ca9d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"675809d6fdbe835dc163df6c","doi":"10.3390/en17235985","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/23/5985/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Application of Squirrel Cage Generator Control System Utilizing Direct Torque Control Method as the Shaft Generator in a Seagoing Ship","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The squirrel cage induction generator or SCIG (Squirrel Cage Induction Generator) belongs to the family of induction machines, which are currently used as the most common electrical machines. The use of power electronic converter systems along with advanced control vector algorithms allows for the implementation of the effective operation of squirrel cage generators in various conditions. Up to now, there are a few practical realizations of squirrel cage generators, which are installed on board the vessels; mostly, these generators act as shaft generators, and it originates from the rules that require self-excitement of main electrical generators, acting as an immediate ready-to-use voltage source. In this article, we present a solution that utilizes an SCIG that operates with varying rotational speed as a shaft generator but can also act as an emergency propeller drive in case of main combustion engine failure. The main achievement of the presented work was the creation of a control table prepared for real-time software of the machine-side inverter. The data for the table were collected during the experimental research, and such a setup allowed us to use a DTC-controlled SCIG as a generator that rotated with variable speed and under changing load."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397275","5e70941b878c28a0473b6467"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"5985","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397275","675809d6fdbe835dc163df6d","5e70941b878c28a0473b6467"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67458308fdbe832eab8f02a4","year":"2024","volume":"17","number":"23","documentHash":"07250765-b035-4219-a84f-0df0eb040f81"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["direct torque control","squirrel cage motor","ship electric grid","sensorless control"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060040968"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"652608a940e3ff22d34a6c2d","name":"Sonia","lastName":"Rudzińska","uuid":"5F6516B40077BE1428E781DFEADAE4D03F7AEFCE8DB0C4236CC367BBD4CAEDF080D90852B522818BF2D0A2BA32A1C1F02F6803017F8AE511DADB1870BD670C15","orcidId":"0009-0002-0942-1533","documentHash":"ae19b121-e560-493a-8d12-77b5d0d3fe23"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b81ae","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"KALBARCZYK-JEDYNAK","uuid":"25AC1644194D3C29AEB2D0A88B383C512A96F8BF9EC0CA7C0C1C43B96DA14628AB75EB50E1627C982D1A1969BDD0E9B5AE95A55CD2E32F3899F2D6BC26FFE6CB","orcidId":"0000-0001-7513-4837","documentHash":"82d9c156-2ea0-41a5-bcd2-bf6a1919803b"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a489","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kaup","uuid":"C7F6842B24AE7D851F746BB317ABD52367EC9B1CC6B9DC784405E574DA9ED7375446845C4B5D17E7606D6CCAAE8E648B9B63E7267FBFCF47422FA0035E2E2F7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9384-8144","documentHash":"488c8c4d-34b8-4f07-9c8f-5bbc32d1ed8a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-11-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6757fb69fdbe835dc16289ef","doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2024.09.701","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1877050924027613?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The possibilities of applying artificial intelligence in maritime navigation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article discusses the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in maritime navigation.

These investments encompass two main components: 1) restoring the local inland waterway fairway for navigation, and 2) constructing a new railway bridge that traverses the primary waterway at the entrance of the seaport. The study is centered on the local transportation system in the northwestern region of Poland. Sustainability is assessed using an analytical tool derived from societal cost-benefit analysis and simulation in the relevant market transport performance in options with and without investment. Economic effects are evaluated in terms of savings in generalized transportation costs, which include transport operating expenses and travel durations. Environmental considerations encompass transport-related air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and well-to-tank emissions. Social aspects focus on issues like transport congestion, traffic noise, and transport-related accidents. Each type of investment yields distinct sustainable gains and distributes them among stakeholders differently. Additionally, the enhanced capacity of the rail bridge reveals the potential for a modal shift in the local passenger transport system, wherein passengers may transition from buses/cars to a fast railway. Tangible gains expressed in monetary terms allow for a sustainable assessment of transport investments. The elaborated research scheme can be employed to assess the sustainable ramifications arising from investments in intermodal transport at any port-city interface. It provides decision-makers with comprehensive insights into the economic, environmental, and social implications of various transport policies and interventions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f8f4","uid":"bNN0GYycX9YWv3CcRaz0UnQ","uuid":"1e7441a5-524f-4801-85eb-283cc41dd106","name":"Instytut Ekonomii i Finansów","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a8878c28a047399ff4"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397214"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"200","pagesFromTo":"114584","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397214","5e7092a8878c28a047399ff4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794fd","mniswId":"17182","title":"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","issn":"1364-0321","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"9a8313b5-2698-4f36-9251-e061fdf885e1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6661ab694097074fa1bd456c","year":"2024","volume":"200","number":"","documentHash":"df92864c-3523-4b72-8887-3b4652ad9233"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainability","assessment","investment","inland shipping","tangible gains"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060244063"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677d0131fdbe833088aab126","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Żabińska","documentHash":"46e8fd04-b887-458c-a215-28f28eea5c64"},{"objectId":"677d0131fdbe833088aab125","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Pilawski","documentHash":"9139480a-5f8e-4ce1-bc4d-304657da2a28"},{"objectId":"5e70941b878c28a0473b6467","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"MATUSZAK","uuid":"0A282DE15AC8F3E725A520A4E06F490DEB740A0DC1C75AE1D0089A1639E4FF2758F222AADE1EE8D413BF676D69DFF6B28853E329DEA35995A60BC8D819C5A0EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-1746-6814","documentHash":"be2b3398-97ad-4419-a769-3f2537fea721"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972d9","name":"DARIUSZ","lastName":"TARNAPOWICZ","uuid":"B2F02446E4E95D09304ED7E7491C0B7D2AE99EB31D6FF1BF764F887969968F5FBF2DC02529ABCC9FF3FEAFF38527EFCA11C2110CDDC46DE85D51FAD2569698E7","orcidId":"0000-0002-9456-2316","documentHash":"9dd63c94-31b7-4b82-a056-3203ea65be2a"},{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f5db","name":"ZBIGNIEW","lastName":"MATUSZAK","uuid":"79FF4750CEDCBED8184B9DEEC9D1866909AB3DFEF0280B4195035B33B2887CFC9C47CD503FF849D865899B1E9CF1DDBF8D74385A4710AABC7A38D2216F74CD79","orcidId":"0000-0002-0554-730X","documentHash":"1772d383-b930-4121-b854-c86fc297ad5e"}],"objectId":"677d0131fdbe833088aab124","publicUri":"https://rynek-energii.pl/pl/node/4680","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Efficiency of solar vacuum collector used in household","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Presentation of the possibilities of reducing CO2 emissions and the costs of heat generation as a result of the use of solar vacuum collectors.

Jej rozwój dotyczy obecnie przede wszystkim Europy i Azji, jednak wzrost zainteresowania możliwością wy­korzystania MFW widoczny jest na całym świecie. Wiele krajów, w tym Polska, stawia na rozwój OZE, a w szczególności na rozwój morskich farm wiatrowych (MFW). Według założeń przedstawionych w Polityce Energetycznej Polski do 2040 r., łączna moc działających MFW osiągnie wartość 5,9 GW w roku 2030 i 11 GW w roku 2040, co będzie stanowiło odpowiednio 13 % i 19 % generowa­nej energii elektrycznej. Rozwój morskiej energetyki wiatrowej niesie ze sobą wiele korzyści, takich jak zmniejszenie emisji gazów cieplarnianych, zwiększenie bezpieczeństwa energetycznego kraju, tworzenie nowych miejsc pracy i rozwój gospodarczy. Ponadto, rozwój technologii i postęp w dziedzinie badań nauko­wych i inżynieryjnych pozwala na coraz bardziej efektywne wykorzystanie ener­gii wiatru na morzu. Z drugiej strony należy jednak pamiętać, że budowa MFW może wpłynąć negatywnie na bezpieczeństwo nawigacji, generując potencjalne zagrożenia dla statków i innych jednostek pływających. Jednym z głównych zagrożeń jest ryzy­ko kolizji statków z elementami konstrukcyjnymi MFW. Zderzenia te mogą wy­nikać z błędów nawigacyjnych, braku aktualnych map, błędnych wskazań urzą­dzeń nawigacyjnych, awarii technicznych lub innych czynników. Dodatkowym zagrożeniem związanym z budową i późniejszą eksploatacją MFW jest ryzyko kolizji między statkami a jednostkami obsługi MFW, takimi jak statki serwisowe. Dodatkowo budowa MFW powoduje zmianę układu przestrzennego istniejących strumieni statków, co może powodować zmiany w prawdopodobieństwie kolizji statków i wejść statków na mieliznę.\n\nW obliczu zagrożeń związanych z budową i eksploatacją coraz większej liczby MFW koniecznym jest podjęcie działań mających na celu zapewnienie bezpieczeństwa nawigacji w ich rejonie. Działania te wymagają zastosowania odpowiednich metod i narzędzi pozwalających na kompleksową ocenę wpływu MFW na bezpieczeństwo nawigacyjne. Na podstawie przeprowadzonej analizy stosowanych obecnie rozwiązań stwierdzono brak modelu pozwalającego na spełnienie tych wymagań. Stało się to przyczyną podjęcia decyzji o budowie metody uwzględniającej wszystkie istotne zagrożenia związane z prowadzeniem żeglugi w rejonie MFW oraz pozwalającej na uwzględnienie wpływu czynników zmieniających się w czasie (np. zmienność siły i kierunku wiatru w zależności od pory roku, okresowe zmiany parametrów strumieni ruchu statków). Przeprowadzona analiza metod instalacji morskich turbin wiatrowych, sto­sowanych rozwiązań technicznych oraz statków wykorzystywanych w związku z ich budową i eksploatacją pozwoliła na identyfikację zagrożeń dla bezpieczeń­stwa nawigacji statków."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a04739729a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a04739729a"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"978-83-64434-59-4","pages":132,"translation":false,"publicationPlace":"Szczecin","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb778","mniswId":"11300","name":"Akademia Morska w Szczecinie","documentHash":"cd457f72-563e-49a6-9a9b-0d70cbc60ea5"},"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["bezpieczeństwo nawigacji","farmy wiatrowe","morskie farmy wiatrowe"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060319150"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093da878c28a0473b1f39","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"MISZTAL","uuid":"5548E49208BAF5D339CDFCC7376D5F68B3E05EC327F3F920718CB7E95709CCE27E6EA8344455A1E341E66B031BC18FD2B7A1E6042A989ECFF4510FF546E26D8E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3327-2144","documentHash":"d9a55c58-a918-4c20-b58f-fd75df483bae"},{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af498","name":"PAULINA","lastName":"HATŁAS-SOWIŃSKA","uuid":"9E8FB981EDC8A772F3D3CD09057D89576C28CD2899A2B1CC8A185127D058FF5F5BDBCB78831012896F3AF806A134231C4EC461D8E4F7641EB4939DEE1679EC19","orcidId":"0000-0002-5761-2994","documentHash":"5d1e5e19-2894-476b-a0e9-f7ae09a7fd5f"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972d3","name":"MIROSŁAW","lastName":"WIELGOSZ","uuid":"D5DA71FE039FE94ADA12D6EB4673C88AB2AE064C97C33707C84AA841621BDC4A78872E9977E9FFD0B8AADC0C74EE6201C6C2B505BEA3A8FE500A1E1F77FC64B1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3113-5018","documentHash":"24582178-134c-426d-95e6-5429e07183ce"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972d2","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"WOŁEJSZA","uuid":"5E12AE92EAD0870FFA46937DF23A5D34F8C6D918F583D0D9D902D1640FC40AECA6A358824EB5E240D0B2A83F8FA64FDAD17519839141EB4E42ECE66F13DE0F22","orcidId":"0000-0003-4284-5223","documentHash":"af5b892d-f43f-4b5b-be2a-440bcaea4ee5"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972cb","name":"ANNA","lastName":"PAŃKA","uuid":"A328522F5DBB4455F8F7C146C8F6295502D942DB1299E65E9B3D55D3EF53F94E0A182E3F489423DBF641BFDA39EEA022DAEE1F3748BD0119F08DF5272BA8E2F7","orcidId":"0000-0001-5506-6750","documentHash":"9f097724-1915-4317-b9c3-bee1b49b6eb1"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739725c","name":"JAROSŁAW","lastName":"CHOMSKI","uuid":"9C79F5F2BF3F7BBB715D566899CCD96A56FD9DD1E0760B96D5FEF21500B02903AA7760F6F183E92C4273F21652EF2B20A23C4F1E020B3A0292A6546229ACAA91","documentHash":"26f34696-4629-4d88-a1ac-d6a8ba80523d"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397241","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"BANAŚ","uuid":"E36ACCE9DC3B24F32572A99CBE6597ACEDA0D6FAE6F9D852740FB7B2346D99D3C822B073E2B79A8D29E458C902958C15999E3171E0A58A94E186794FAD68F169","orcidId":"0000-0003-1029-1393","documentHash":"116a80c8-0329-4c08-b2df-cf7317f936d7"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739721b","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"BORKOWSKI","uuid":"687492162CB4DEED79E55C9C326215141175656F5AE1722E42E7DAB360479A3017246094E4C445AC3FD5BCF6BA2F3648A7D7484A707479D4D26908D204EEB13C","orcidId":"0000-0001-5278-0633","documentHash":"fb650cab-7fb7-47f5-9898-c90d30515163"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a0473971ff","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"BREITSPRECHER","uuid":"C302732543467B08F425444AC23CCED96746CEA55A9E012DD9D6A98C4117FB02BD310315D9279E385E7500844CF9308E7FEEC27040CEFFFDACA8F688F6C426BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2397-9357","documentHash":"8db61c7d-b9c2-455b-9c1e-1aa0e1215bf3"},{"objectId":"5e709239878c28a047391eb9","name":"ZBIGNIEW","lastName":"PIETRZYKOWSKI","uuid":"37FE929D552E69A08EBBED960118B5211697D3E05B3D5FA0E7E9503EAABDC758AAA61ECD44DD0E372653E6821D06CB9A98D2C93969D4DF01EFADC690A989CCAE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2116-9513","documentHash":"b771a43f-bd27-4c7c-aee2-36ee27a88afe"}],"objectId":"677e54e3fdbe8372a5ec74e9","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-78468-2_3","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-78468-2_3","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Communication in Encounter Situations of Autonomous and Non-autonomous Ships","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Research on autonomous ships is in progress in many centres around the world. It is expected that soon these ships will gradually start entering service. More and more encounters at sea will involve manned vessels, including leisure boats and yachts, and autonomous ships. In such cases communication is carried out on the manned vessel by a navigator, and on the autonomous vessel an information system acts a virtual navigator. Part of the present research has focused on an analysis of the communication between human navigators during ship encounters. Based on this, the concept of a virtual navigator has been developed using methods and tools of artificial intelligence. The authors propose decision-making algorithms for communication in collision situations, where negotiations aimed at mutual agreement of appropriate manoeuvres are taken into account. Simulated encounters of an autonomous and non-autonomous ship for selected scenarios allowed us to assess whether the executed communication processes proceeded correctly. A system of this type can enable communication between a navigator and an autonomous ship using natural language."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972cb","5e709285878c28a0473972d3","5e709239878c28a047391eb9","5e7093da878c28a0473b1f39","5e7093b1878c28a0473af498","5e709284878c28a04739721b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"1218","pagesFromTo":"30-41","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709239878c28a047391eb9","5e709285878c28a0473972d3","5e7093b1878c28a0473af498","5e7093da878c28a0473b1f39","5e709285878c28a0473972cb","5e709284878c28a0473971ff","5e709284878c28a04739721b","5e709284878c28a047397241","5e709285878c28a0473972d2","5e709284878c28a04739725c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff40cad49b31ccec10be3","title":"Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems","issn":"2367-3370","websiteLink":"https://link.springer.com/bookseries/15179","documentHash":"773daf41-c9a2-4979-81f0-7dc4dfa5e623"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677d28acfdbe833088adc4dc","year":"2024","volume":"1218","documentHash":"a4e2881d-48f8-4da4-a763-396f62339c10"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["autonomous ships","collision avoidance","navigation","virtual navigator","human-machine communication"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060361059"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677cf9f7fdbe833088a9d281","name":"Boris S.","lastName":"Sergeev","documentHash":"702a3fd1-336b-4be6-b2af-2299dfcd7cca"},{"objectId":"5e70941b878c28a0473b6467","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"MATUSZAK","uuid":"0A282DE15AC8F3E725A520A4E06F490DEB740A0DC1C75AE1D0089A1639E4FF2758F222AADE1EE8D413BF676D69DFF6B28853E329DEA35995A60BC8D819C5A0EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-1746-6814","documentHash":"be2b3398-97ad-4419-a769-3f2537fea721"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972d9","name":"DARIUSZ","lastName":"TARNAPOWICZ","uuid":"B2F02446E4E95D09304ED7E7491C0B7D2AE99EB31D6FF1BF764F887969968F5FBF2DC02529ABCC9FF3FEAFF38527EFCA11C2110CDDC46DE85D51FAD2569698E7","orcidId":"0000-0002-9456-2316","documentHash":"9dd63c94-31b7-4b82-a056-3203ea65be2a"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739722d","name":"LECH","lastName":"DOROBCZYŃSKI","uuid":"C288151E46DB81947D7A8C31B905BC563750794556E56A43E4ACF1C623ADE8A5D7DACF8CB564F2BF341AAB62B4732C2E2AE86FEF20E3F1872FA8DF25A3DC4B41","orcidId":"0000-0001-8388-8700","documentHash":"37c0d642-f93b-40a4-94f1-fc71b0a3a24e"}],"objectId":"677cf9f7fdbe833088a9d27f","publicUri":"https://rynek-energii.pl/pl/node/4677","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Innovative method of power supply of railway signalling systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper deals with the issues of power supply to signal points of railroad traffic control system.

A new original way of powering signalling points of railroad traffic control without the use of high voltage lines, where the power source is the energy of rail vehicle movement can be an alternative to currently used power supply systems.

This paper presents the verification of the hypothesis that the changes in lubricity, friction coefficient, and decreasing oil film thickness (using a relative approach, given as a percentage) are similar for lubricating oil and diesel mixtures prepared from fresh lubricating oil and used lubricating oil. To validate this hypothesis, an experiment is conducted using a high-frequency reciprocating rig (HFFR), in which the lubricity is determined by the corrected average wear scar WS1.4, the coefficient of friction μ, and the percentage relative decrease in oil film thickness r. A qualitative visual assessment of the wear scars on the test specimens is also performed after the HFFR tests. The testing covers mixtures of SAE 30 grade Marinol CB-30 RG1230 lubricating oil with Orlen Efecta Diesel Biodiesel. The used lubricating oil is extracted from the circulating lubrication system of a supercharged, trunk-piston, four-stroke ZUT Zgoda Sulzer 5 BAH 22 engine installed in the laboratory of ship power plants of the Maritime University of Szczecin. Mixtures for the experiment are prepared for fresh lubricating oil with diesel oil and used lubricating oil with diesel oil. Mixtures of these lubricating oils with diesel oil are examined for diesel oil concentrations in the mixture equal to 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20% m/m. The results of the experiment confirm the hypothesis, proving that, for up to 20% m/m diesel oil concentration in lubricating oil, the changes in the lubricity of used lubricating oil diluted with diesel oil can be evaluated based on reference data prepared for mixtures of diesel oil with fresh lubricating oil. The linear approximation of μ and r trends is made with a certain margin of error we estimated. The experiment also confirms the results of previous studies which state that oil aging products in small quantities contribute to improved lubricity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c8","633503297523402e340d735a","6164f32875234017e052497d","5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"4567","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245","5e709285878c28a0473972c8","633503297523402e340d735a","6164f32875234017e052497d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff33dad49b31ccec0104f","title":"Applied Sciences","issn":"2076-3417","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"96f827ef-c2c8-4b76-ab17-c7357fffee4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6662cb8a4097075bc10cfbc0","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"11","documentHash":"4008b8bf-0b5d-488e-bd84-c262d43f243b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["diesel oil","high-frequency reciprocating rig","lubricity","fuel dilution","fresh lubricating oil","used lubricating oil","HFRR"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060396223"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678fa2b6fdbe835856bad705","name":"J.","lastName":"Vega","documentHash":"bb9409c4-0e7a-4f7c-b2f7-4a49acb3c4df"},{"objectId":"678fa2b6fdbe835856bad704","name":"I.","lastName":"Wyss","documentHash":"f747b7f2-f510-4635-8aeb-38bf6d98efe5"},{"objectId":"678fa2b6fdbe835856bad703","name":"T.","lastName":"Craciunescu","documentHash":"58e9965c-4e71-42c2-a555-3c15eea0edd9"},{"objectId":"678fa2b6fdbe835856bad702","name":"M.","lastName":"Gelfusa","documentHash":"0d6cde6f-cd25-4082-904a-770dd8760609"},{"objectId":"678fa2b6fdbe835856bad701","name":"R.","lastName":"Rossi","documentHash":"9c70b9f7-156f-4149-b542-299e6d56fbd0"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397202","name":"BOHDAN","lastName":"BIEG","uuid":"824102936597EAEAFDC0CA005121E68A31F5CD249313BB3DE7A696711B7AF50AA39660B4406408C7C6F1876B2B4C60A29C04488145A12D92F4454003EDE7904F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3649-6349","documentHash":"4211ff14-2499-4712-b9b5-bf009f77c090"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-27","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"678fa2b6fdbe835856bad700","doi":"10.1088/1741-4326/ad2723","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ad2723","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A hybrid physics/data-driven logic to detect, classify, and predict anomalies and disruptions in tokamak plasmas","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Disruptions are abrupt collapses of the configuration that have afflicted all tokamaks ever operated. Reliable observers are a prerequisite to the definition and the deployment of any realistic strategy of countermeasures to avoid or mitigate disruptions. Lacking first principle models of the dynamics leading to disruptions, in the past decades empirical predictors have been extensively studied and some were even installed in JET real time network. Having been conceived as engineering tools, they were often very abstract. In this work, physics and data-driven methodologies are combined to identify the main macroscopic precursors of disruptions: magnetic instabilities, abnormal kinetic profiles and radiation patterns. Machine learning predictors utilising these observers can not only detect and classify these anomalies but also determine their probability of occurrence and estimate the time remaining before their onset. These tools have been applied to a database of about two thousand JET discharges with various isotopic compositions including DT, in conditions simulating in all respects real time deployment. Their performance would meet ITER requirements, and they are expected to be easily transferrable to larger devices, because they rely only on normalised quantities, form factors, and physical/empirical scaling laws."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w

shattered pellet injection (SPI) into a 3 MA / 7 MJ JET H-mode plasma is studied via 3D non-linear MHD modelling with the JOREK code. The interpretative modelling captures the overall evolution of the measured density and radiated power. The simulations also identify the importance of the drifts of ablation plasmoids towards the tokamak low field side (LFS) and the impurities in the background plasma in fragment penetration, assimilation, radiative cooling and MHD activity in D 2 SPI experiments. It is found that plasmoid drifts lead to an about 70% reduction of the central line-integrated density (compared to a simulation without drifts) in the JET D 2 SPI discharge considered. Impurities that pre-exist before the SPI as well as those from possible impurity influxes related to the SPI are shown to dominate the radiation in the considered discharge. With inputs from JOREK simulations, modelling with the Lagrangian particle-based pellet code PELOTON reproduces the deviation of the SPI fragments in the direction of the major radius as observed by the fast camera. This confirms the role of rocket effects and plasmoid drifts in the considered discharge and reinforces the validity of the JOREK modelling. The limited core density rise due to plasmoid drifts and the strong radiative cooling and MHD activity with impurities (depending on their species and concentration) could limit the effectiveness of LFS D 2 SPI in runaway electron avoidance and are worth considering in the design of the ITER disruption mitigation system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w

interaction between radio frequency (RF) waves used for ion cyclotron resonance heating and the fast deuterium (D) and tritium (T) neutral Beam injected (NBI) ions in DT plasma. The focus is on the effects of this interaction, also referred to as synergistic effects, on the fusion performance in the recent JET DTE2 campaign. Experimental data from dedicated pulses at 3.43 T/2.3 MA heated at (i) 51.4 MHz, giving the central minority H and n = 2 D, and at (ii) 32.2 MHz for the central minority 3He and n = 2 T. Resonances are analysed and conclusions are drawn and supported by modelling of the synergistic effects. Modelling with transport code TRANSP runs with and without the RF kick operator predict a moderate increase, of about 10%, in DT rates for the case of the RF wave-fast D NBI ion interactions at the n = 2 harmonic of ion cyclotron resonance, and a negligible impact due to synergistic interaction between fast T NBI ions and RF waves. JETTO modelling gives a 29% enhancement in fusion rates due to the interction between RF waves and fast D NBI ions, and an 18% enhancement in fast T NBI ions. Analysis of experimental neutron rates compared to TRANSP predictions without synergistic effects and magnetic proton recoil neutron spectrometer indicate an enhancement of approximately 25%-28% in fusion rates due to RF interaction with fast D ions, and an enhancement of approximately 5%-8% when RF waves and fast T NBI ions are interacting. The contributions of various heating and fast ion sources are assessed and discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"64","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"16026","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6de9","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6dea","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6deb","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6dec","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6ded","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6dee","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6def","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6df0","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6df1","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6df2","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6df3","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6df4","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6df5","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6df6","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6df7","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6df8","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6df9","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6dfa","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6dfb","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6dfc","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6dfd","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6dfe","678f9e3ffdbe835856ba6dff","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"NUCLEAR FUSION","doi":"10.1088/issn.0029-5515","issn":"0029-5515","documentHash":"88422204-97ec-4fb6-bc55-866a72c6c2e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678f9849fdbe835856b9b457","year":"2024","volume":"64","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"8c24a748-4ddb-4479-bc8c-b9086731ed15"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["DT plasmas","fusion performance","JET"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060399666"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a849b","name":"KONRAD","lastName":"MAROSEK","uuid":"BC9B7967F0211A591C992BE16BF47863C4D9D0719F69B51F32E5FCA0CE327C61F7E4DA981387A875E87B553DCE52222715F100AEC16723160EF5B0C73E70ED77","orcidId":"0000-0002-5681-8245","documentHash":"096d2981-1c4f-4438-b701-b72f2a28da03"},{"objectId":"5e7092a7878c28a047399f6a","name":"ADAM","lastName":"BALCERZAK","uuid":"5721D93462C0A25851BB4001018DBA032631598B69ED10648C993256B46A28920A8F2807F67036B2DC4359ED2F6F4A126B8AFC647A7919A6E4B67B9FE3D6FE46","orcidId":"0000-0002-9047-4941","documentHash":"caef6556-79f7-45d2-8f75-fd52277c215c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"66eeecdafdbe834dc4257569","doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-72794-1","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-72794-1","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Conformal structure of singularities in some varying fundamental constants bimetric cosmologies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we explore the conformal structure of singularities arising from varying fundamental constants using the method of Penrose diagrams. We employ a specific type of bimetric model featuring two different metrics. One metric describes the causal structure for matter, while the other characterizes the causal structure for gravitational interactions, which is related to variations in fundamental constants such as the gravitational constant and the speed of light. For this reason, we focused on the gravitational metric to calculate the conformal transformation and compose Penrose diagrams for the singularities arising from the varying fundamental constants. We have shown that, in one case, the parameter such as the scale factor, the density and the pressure resemble those of the finite scale factor singularity (FSF). Despite singularity appears in constant conformal time in our case and in the case of FSF the Misner-Sharp horizon looks different. Our another case is similar to sudden future singularity (SFS), but there are differences in the conformal structures. We have also shown that in our cases the behavior of Misner-Sharp horizon strongly depends on initial conditions. The last analytical solution which we introduced is identical to conformal structure of the standard exotic singularity for the matter."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f901","uid":"b6gUQbt4pHMAgmA8CPCfM6A","uuid":"c4de155a-292f-41b5-b74a-7ee5f8ef2f26","name":"Instytut Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a7878c28a047399f6a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935e878c28a0473a849b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"21468","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70935e878c28a0473a849b","5e7092a7878c28a047399f6a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"2045-2322","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6597d34e40970755be5e2b9e","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"1","documentHash":"7b2bf3c4-186e-4bd9-8908-044ad024e285"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bimetric cosmological models","cosmological singularities","varying fundamental constants","Penorse diagrams"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060427573"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677faf07fdbe831a91d30080","name":"Evgeny","lastName":"Ochin","documentHash":"07148d03-ce06-4cd6-8f51-f5d7dc5e93a3"},{"objectId":"677faf07fdbe831a91d3007f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Puzio","documentHash":"763a4c5a-277f-4b75-90f4-c2b4456ffc87"},{"objectId":"677faf07fdbe831a91d3007e","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Prochacki","documentHash":"30eca26f-53cf-40b4-98c8-34e5ac67d847"},{"objectId":"677faf07fdbe831a91d3007d","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Lemieszewski","documentHash":"061851d6-44c7-492d-87cf-79f53d645c9d"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739721b","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"BORKOWSKI","uuid":"687492162CB4DEED79E55C9C326215141175656F5AE1722E42E7DAB360479A3017246094E4C445AC3FD5BCF6BA2F3648A7D7484A707479D4D26908D204EEB13C","orcidId":"0000-0001-5278-0633","documentHash":"fb650cab-7fb7-47f5-9898-c90d30515163"}],"objectId":"677faf07fdbe831a91d3007c","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-78468-2_19","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-78468-2_19","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Distances Between Successive Vehicle Position Measurements in the Decision Rule for an Intelligent GNSS Signal Spoofing Detection System Using a Single Antenna","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents the concept of a decision rule for the needs of an intelligent GNSS signal spoofing detection system using a single antenna. GNSS spoofing detection using a single antenna is essentially similar to GNSS spoofing detection using two antennas. The main difference is that position measurements made simultaneously at two different points in space are replaced by two successive position measurements spaced in time. It turns out that based on the course of the distance between successive measurements of the position of a vehicle moving at a known speed, it is possible to effectively design a decision rule for the needs of an intelligent GNSS signal spoofing detection system using a single antenna. This is because when determining the distance between successive measurements of the vehicle's position, a significant proportion of the measurement errors of the satellite positioning system are reduced. This significantly reduces the dead zone of GNSS spoofing detection using a single antenna.

Addressing these challenges requires an integrated vision of physics and engineering aspects with the purpose of simultaneously increasing time duration and fusion performance. Significant progress has been made in tokamaks and stellarators, including very recent achievement in duration and/or performance. This progress is reviewed by analyzing the experimental data (109 plasma pulses with a total of 3200 data points, i.e. on average 29 data per pulse) provided by ten tokamaks (in alphabetical order: Axially Symmetric Divertor Experiment Upgrade, DIII-D, Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak, Joint European Torus, JT-60 Upgrade, Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research, tokamak a configuration variable, Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor, Tore Supra, W Environment in Steady-State Tokamak) and two stellarators (Large Helical Device and Wendelstein 7-X) expanding the pioneering work of Kikuchi (Kikuchi M. and Azumi M. 2015 Frontiers in Fusion Research II: Introduction to Modern Tokamak Physics (Springer)). Data have been gathered up to January 2022 and coordination has been provided by the recently created International Energy Agency-International Atomic Energy Agency international Coordination on International Challenges on Long duration OPeration group. By exploiting the multi-machine international database, recent progress in terms of injected energies (e.g. 1730 MJ in L-mode, 425 MJ in H-mode), durations (1056 s in L-mode, 101 s in H-mode), injected powers, and sustained performance will be reviewed. Progress has been made to sustain long-pulse operation in tokamaks and stellarators with superconducting coils, actively cooled components, and/or with metallic walls. The graph of the fusion triple products as a function of duration shows a dramatic reduction of, at least two orders of magnitude when increasing the plasma duration from less than 1 s to 100 s. Indeed, long-pulse operation is usually reached in dominant electron-heating modes at reduced density (current drive optimization) but with low ion temperatures ranging from 1 to 3 keV for discharges above 100 s. Difficulties in extending the duration may arise from coupling high heating powers over long durations and the evolving plasma-wall interaction towards an unstable operational domain. Possible causes limiting the duration and critical issues to be addressed prior to ITER operation and DEMO design are reported and analyzed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"64","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"15001","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["678f9b85fdbe835856ba32c6","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32c7","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32c8","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32c9","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32ca","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32cb","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32cc","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32cd","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32ce","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32cf","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32d0","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32d1","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32d2","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32d3","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32d4","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32d5","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32d6","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32d7","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32d8","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32d9","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32da","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32db","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32dc","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32dd","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32de","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32df","678f9b85fdbe835856ba32e0","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"NUCLEAR FUSION","doi":"10.1088/issn.0029-5515","issn":"0029-5515","documentHash":"88422204-97ec-4fb6-bc55-866a72c6c2e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678f9849fdbe835856b9b457","year":"2024","volume":"64","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"8c24a748-4ddb-4479-bc8c-b9086731ed15"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["nuclear fusion","long plasma duration operation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060471081"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678fa157fdbe835856ba9898","name":"A.","lastName":"Murari","documentHash":"a888e470-5dcb-4ef1-bfed-0c6f8a09b5a5"},{"objectId":"678fa157fdbe835856ba9897","name":"J.D.","lastName":"Fernández","documentHash":"83d9834b-9eee-46ed-846c-62fa42657e6b"},{"objectId":"678fa157fdbe835856ba9896","name":"R.","lastName":"Castro","documentHash":"d9ebd52a-2d7f-429a-ad0c-2c5def9c96cb"},{"objectId":"678fa157fdbe835856ba9895","name":"S.","lastName":"Dormido-Canto","documentHash":"861fd6f7-b591-4c54-8865-4030b4042699"},{"objectId":"678fa157fdbe835856ba9894","name":"J.","lastName":"Vega","documentHash":"9d507321-863b-401f-b391-77a364da6059"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397202","name":"BOHDAN","lastName":"BIEG","uuid":"824102936597EAEAFDC0CA005121E68A31F5CD249313BB3DE7A696711B7AF50AA39660B4406408C7C6F1876B2B4C60A29C04488145A12D92F4454003EDE7904F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3649-6349","documentHash":"4211ff14-2499-4712-b9b5-bf009f77c090"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-27","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"678fa157fdbe835856ba9892","doi":"10.1088/1741-4326/ad288a","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ad288a","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Real-time disruption prediction in multi-dimensional spaces leveraging diagnostic information not available at execution time","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article describes the use of privileged information to train supervised classifiers, applied for the first time to the prediction of disruptions in tokamaks. The objective consists of making predictions with real-time signals during the discharges (as usual) but after training the predictor also with any kind of data at training time that is not available during discharge execution. The latter kind of data is known as privileged information. Taking into account the limited number of foreseen real time signals for disruption prediction at the beginning of operation in JT-60SA, a predictor with a line integrated density signal and the mode lock signal as privileged information has been developed and tested with 1437 JET discharges. The success rate with positive warning time has been improved from 45.24% to 90.48% and the tardy detection rate has diminished from 50% to 8.33%. The use of privileged information in an adaptive way also provides a remarkable reduction of false alarms from 11.53% to 1.15%. The potential of the methodology, exemplified with data relevant to the beginning of JT-60SA operation, is absolutely general and can be applied to any combination of diagnostic signals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"64","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"46010","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["678fa157fdbe835856ba9894","678fa157fdbe835856ba9895","678fa157fdbe835856ba9896","678fa157fdbe835856ba9897","678fa157fdbe835856ba9898","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"NUCLEAR FUSION","doi":"10.1088/issn.0029-5515","issn":"0029-5515","documentHash":"88422204-97ec-4fb6-bc55-866a72c6c2e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678fa157fdbe835856ba9893","year":"2024","volume":"64","number":"4","documentHash":"74060af5-e5fe-4598-a322-cd6fd774df01"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["disruption prediction","privileged information","SVMplus"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060471119"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67909dc1fdbe831a38420c36","name":"Joelle","lastName":"Mailloux","documentHash":"5a857fb2-abda-454c-a778-4dc2f3a717ce"},{"objectId":"5e7094f1878c28a0473c78aa","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Fortuna-Zaleśna","uuid":"41B27A244D61FA19A490125578CC89EFC4E6F50B0FBDA10F63F4AD6F32DE352CD1981A3C0E43EF51B53C8FB75C9A614E8A0C58E4209D5215883FEF1DC6C3AF79","orcidId":"0000-0002-1090-1641","documentHash":"0aa1e0a9-8576-429b-8626-7fa6f53e5547"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b29","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Ciupiński","uuid":"6AF141A46D6720CB65F854C6DE276DB9FA6DE2FEDAAE6EB55689C593B31219584D79141A6FA6851DCD7065C56F1FA26722E9CADF483FA862BE8EADC1ADCC5F3A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4536-3177","documentHash":"c3996df0-7e3a-43af-bc80-1dba2cadb3fc"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397202","name":"BOHDAN","lastName":"BIEG","uuid":"824102936597EAEAFDC0CA005121E68A31F5CD249313BB3DE7A696711B7AF50AA39660B4406408C7C6F1876B2B4C60A29C04488145A12D92F4454003EDE7904F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3649-6349","documentHash":"4211ff14-2499-4712-b9b5-bf009f77c090"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-07","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62cbcdb3409707746ec451d2","doi":"10.1088/1741-4326/ac47b4","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ac47b4","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Overview of JET results for optimising ITER operation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The JET 2019–2020 scientific and technological programme exploited the results of years of concerted scientific and engineering work, including the ITER-like wall (ILW: Be wall and W divertor) installed in 2010, improved diagnostic capabilities now fully available, a major neutral beam injection upgrade providing record power in 2019–2020, and tested the technical and procedural preparation for safe operation with tritium. Research along three complementary axes yielded a wealth of new results. Firstly, the JET plasma programme delivered scenarios suitable for high fusion power and alpha particle (α) physics in the coming D–T campaign (DTE2), with record sustained neutron rates, as well as plasmas for clarifying the impact of isotope mass on plasma core, edge and plasma-wall interactions, and for ITER pre-fusion power operation. The efficacy of the newly installed shattered pellet injector for mitigating disruption forces and runaway electrons was demonstrated. Secondly, research on the consequences of long-term exposure to JET-ILW plasma was completed, with emphasis on wall damage and fuel retention, and with analyses of wall materials and dust particles that will help validate assumptions and codes for design and operation of ITER and DEMO. Thirdly, the nuclear technology programme aiming to deliver maximum technological return from operations in D, T and D–T benefited from the highest D–D neutron yield in years, securing results for validating radiation transport and activation codes, and nuclear data for ITER."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f1878c28a0473c78aa","5e709326878c28a0473a3b29"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"62","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"42026","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67909dc1fdbe831a38420c36","5e709326878c28a0473a3b29","5e7094f1878c28a0473c78aa","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"Nuclear Fusion","issn":"0029-5515","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b31dac4e-f019-4fd0-8d65-ca8cc13bd652"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6242fa5e2467f04b0b32841c","year":"2022","volume":"62","number":"4","documentHash":"1dc4632c-f636-498b-838d-174c5d815548"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["overview","D–T preparation","plasma facing components (PFC)","tritium operations","isotope","nuclear technology","JET with ITER-like wall"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060471129"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67a34e3afdbe833baf12e184","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Jedynak","documentHash":"2115332b-e8a3-4d2e-b90d-e8c67476bb1f"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6cbe","name":"MAŁGORZATA","lastName":"ŁĄCKA","uuid":"9AF91CA6000332BEED504FB674EE30EC8BC169635DBE698E3B558AE33331BE79AEBE15BDC3485DC8E6BF50BEC31A131B492877221C508A5FCA0307E0C20C619B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5899-4659","documentHash":"dc4801fa-ac8b-4513-83ce-58b0a814cca8"},{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739dfd1","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"KOGUT","uuid":"5B0C06ED610B72ADC9999A8189EC58450034280A4DF911965EE34C0EF6427633212D72185DA7FA1DEF78797F363EB6F47B7CD3270DA97DE7DCBD76FBAF481DD7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9646-275X","documentHash":"2a6638f6-93e3-4159-8be0-6971fcdca6dd"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a04739897e","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"STĘPIEŃ","uuid":"2DB2CE61E76FA8FA4C53CBC434774937F20E2F6F0EEDBDE295411733A41602A8A67D83D683ECC68473F9CF858E85226A3D62066AA70D1AADAFCD7F7B32277C3C","orcidId":"0000-0002-1080-6388","documentHash":"472f00dc-4d89-4fb1-bdb4-db6a71e68b0f"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972ed","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"ZANIEWICZ","uuid":"57C296112A3CA1E2B5DBA8C96547095BA52D9A0F88767466B62803F5F0B4EB92EE0482BBC915DE6529564EEC096C3754C5A2240B04FC380B41E0CA8479197FCB","orcidId":"0000-0001-7942-3644","documentHash":"6f094511-e274-44da-a225-9f0a1d64d35c"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972cd","name":"ARKADIUSZ","lastName":"TOMCZAK","uuid":"073A1937B996328768EB350854B9BB5EE6FEA84A23DC0057D8F64CFAF6F3BEA62184A10E0B2F10B37B010BE3C2B68489F9DC0A89D5F0B2D62F16C9E1230436E0","orcidId":"0000-0003-1275-2659","documentHash":"32b874ea-5670-4730-8538-e2ef102620bb"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397216","name":"IZABELA","lastName":"BODUS-OLKOWSKA","uuid":"695DFA5F274060E776FA8B0D7D04A28F3AB48F092027C6123A3277F2134AC256F2E9660526299BD7DCE881F9512FB9F7E974063D2B84EC911C311E0BAA419FB3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4366-0116","documentHash":"2b1d3665-1483-40c2-99df-c8511769c8a0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-31","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"67a34e3afdbe833baf12e183","doi":"10.3390/app15010315","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/1/315/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Development of a Digital Twin of the Harbour Waters and Surrounding Infrastructure Based on Spatial Data Acquired with Multimodal and Multi-Sensor Mapping Systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Digital twin is an attractive technology for the representation of objects due to its ability to produce precise measurements and their geovisualisation. Of special interest is the application and fusion of various remote sensing techniques for shallow river and inland water areas, commonly measured using conventional surveying or multimodal photogrammetry. The construction of spatial digital twins of river areas requires the use of multi-platform and multi-sensor measurements to obtain reliable data of the river environment. Due to the high dynamics of river changes, the cost of measurements and the difficult-to-access measurement area, the mapping should be large-scale and simultaneous. To address these challenges, the authors performed an experiment using three measurement platforms (boat, plane, UAV) and multiple sensors to acquire both cloud and image spatial data, which were integrated temporally and spatially. The integration methods improved the accuracy of the resulting digital model by approximately 20 percent."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d8878c28a04739dfd1","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6cbe","5e709285878c28a0473972cd","5e709285878c28a0473972ed","5e709297878c28a04739897e","5e709284878c28a047397216"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"315","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972cd","5e709297878c28a04739897e","5e7092d8878c28a04739dfd1","67a34e3afdbe833baf12e184","5e709285878c28a0473972ed","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6cbe","5e709284878c28a047397216"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff33dad49b31ccec0104f","title":"Applied Sciences","issn":"2076-3417","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"96f827ef-c2c8-4b76-ab17-c7357fffee4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6777dfcefdbe833ec1cc0641","year":"2025","volume":"15","number":"1","documentHash":"2038c2f7-7bdc-4773-8a60-d23714edeb2a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["data fusion","inland navigation","offshore surveying","similarity transformation","shallow water","digital twin","full waveform","LiDAR bathymetry","hydrographic survey"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060498008"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6344d52a7523402e341121bc","name":"KAROLINA","lastName":"KAŚKOSZ","uuid":"3C84AD597BE3B7FEADAD71026FE31928D8E15FA0CE875CDF5651D2608D74DE2AE38720DBDFADA3DFE688A9F980294A7D0734A3AAB069A5F4F92C0662D1F7BC97","orcidId":"0000-0002-9895-8537","documentHash":"e07e79e4-7df7-49c5-a2d8-5b98cead5e9b"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739721f","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"DUDEK","uuid":"FAAA9787FF1D3141BC5578B3872357CA0D2790635E5A82969C91C12ADCBB17C62FFCD641CCF3F71D77B70EE3C3E43DB2E3108AC09E33E2F40CED318C1FAA9B12","orcidId":"0000-0002-0003-779X","documentHash":"9ef841ab-4f58-4e47-83a3-d9753a2bbe04"}],"objectId":"6799d76dfdbe831aedc7ac80","doi":"10.1016/j.trd.2025.104610","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1361920925000203?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Optimizing drone logistics in complex urban industrial infrastructure","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article introduces innovative model addressing the “Drone Routing Problem” within multifloor manufacturing sites.

Instead of heating fuel ions, most of the energy of alpha particles is transferred to electrons in the plasma. Furthermore, alpha particles can also excite Alfvénic instabilities, which were previously considered to be detrimental to the performance of the fusion device. Here we report improved thermal ion confinement in the presence of megaelectronvolts ions and strong fast ion-driven Alfvénic instabilities in recent experiments on the Joint European Torus. Detailed transport analysis of these experiments reveals turbulence suppression through a complex multi-scale mechanism that generates large-scale zonal flows. This holds promise for more economical operation of fusion reactors with dominant alpha particle heating and ultimately cheaper fusion electricity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika

diagnostics were employed to measure 14 MeV neutrons originating from D(T,n)4He reactions. In discharge 99965, a diamond matrix detector (KM14) and a magnetic proton recoil (MPRu) detector with a vertical and an oblique line-of-sight were used, respectively. At the timepoints of interest, a significant decrease in the expected diagnostic signals can be observed as electromagnetic wave heating in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) is switched off. Utilizing only TRANSP simulation data, the fast-ion distribution is found to have been likely composed mostly of trapped orbits. In contrast, analysis performed using orbit weight functions revealed that the majority of neutrons in the KM14 E d = 9.3 MeV and MPRu X cm = 33 cm measurement bins are to have originated from fast deuterium ions on co-passing orbits. This work explains the perhaps surprising results and shows that the relative signal decrease as ICRF heating is switched off is largest for counter-passing orbits. Finally, for the magnetic equilibria of interest, it is shown how stagnation orbits, corresponding to ∼ 1 % of the fast-ion distribution, were completely unobservable by the KM14 diagnostic."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"64","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"26015","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c80","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c81","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c82","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c83","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c84","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c85","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c86","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c87","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c88","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c89","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c8a","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c8b","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c8c","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c8d","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c8e","678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c8f","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"NUCLEAR FUSION","doi":"10.1088/issn.0029-5515","issn":"0029-5515","documentHash":"88422204-97ec-4fb6-bc55-866a72c6c2e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678f9f67fdbe835856ba7c7f","year":"2024","volume":"64","number":"2","documentHash":"64d9b73f-32dd-4e30-b6bb-7ef81ac80b4f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["diagnostics","fast ions","neutron emission spectroscopy","orbit","sensitivity","weight function"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060534117"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987e7","name":"M.","lastName":"Tardocchi","documentHash":"5dea1900-8266-4c62-b4d8-a4c82813dd82"},{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987e6","name":"Ž.","lastName":"Štancar","documentHash":"fbaec39d-8a67-4403-8d84-c8749e658c18"},{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987e5","name":"Z.","lastName":"Ghani","documentHash":"1605141e-941b-40a1-aa47-517faa4dddbc"},{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987e4","name":"V.","lastName":"Kiptily","documentHash":"afb54f4b-0708-4548-ad92-6d3b387d012e"},{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987e3","name":"J.","lastName":"Eriksson","documentHash":"0d2fc476-0b68-45c1-a3f3-87677e299da2"},{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987e2","name":"G.","lastName":"Ericsson","documentHash":"c14be4ad-1b9a-48e1-bf84-247950993359"},{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987e1","name":"S.","lastName":"Conroy","documentHash":"71216202-8ea2-4b41-a62a-8bf7032ff4da"},{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987e0","name":"E.","lastName":"Perelli Cippo","documentHash":"6a81e718-2a47-4110-b14d-306f91e03013"},{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987df","name":"M.","lastName":"Nocente","documentHash":"75aee3ed-2a8d-4d3b-ac64-0db7b6ab246a"},{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987de","name":"G.","lastName":"Gorini","documentHash":"554e7314-17a2-4a19-a83b-b06676ebc9bc"},{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987dd","name":"L.","lastName":"Giacomelli","documentHash":"0eed96bf-198b-4286-ad7c-95f5ad9f05ea"},{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987dc","name":"M.","lastName":"Rebai","documentHash":"3bd26078-3a4f-4086-ba93-fc3782628c1e"},{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987db","name":"A.","lastName":"Muraro","documentHash":"88ed5ce9-e494-4cea-9feb-d24185479d2b"},{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987da","name":"A.","lastName":"Dal Molin","documentHash":"f4d3b1aa-7eb5-4e2c-b83a-c6fb6bff6f33"},{"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987d9","name":"D.","lastName":"Rigamonti","documentHash":"b32ba57e-1614-4422-a0a5-1b63bbfe387d"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397202","name":"BOHDAN","lastName":"BIEG","uuid":"824102936597EAEAFDC0CA005121E68A31F5CD249313BB3DE7A696711B7AF50AA39660B4406408C7C6F1876B2B4C60A29C04488145A12D92F4454003EDE7904F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3649-6349","documentHash":"4211ff14-2499-4712-b9b5-bf009f77c090"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-23","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"678f97f4fdbe835856b987d7","doi":"10.1088/1741-4326/ad0a49","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ad0a49","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The single crystal diamond-based diagnostic suite of the JET tokamak for 14 MeV neutron counting and spectroscopy measurements in DT plasmas","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Joint European Torus (JET) has recently conducted its second deuterium-tritium (DT) experimental campaign DTE2, providing unique opportunity for studying both physics and engineering aspects of nuclear fusion plasmas. This also allowed the exploitation of new diagnostics and technologies that were not available during the first JET DT campaign held in 1997. Among these new instruments, the enhancement projects of the JET nuclear diagnostics lead to the development and installation of synthetic single crystal diamond detectors along different collimated line of sights. This paper describes the single crystal diamond-based diagnostic suite of the JET tokamak and the enhanced 14 MeV neutron diagnostic capabilities in terms of neutron yield and high resolution neutron spectroscopy. The diamond characterization measurements and the calibration procedure at JET are shown, together with performance of the diamond based neutron spectrometer as 14 MeV neutron yield monitor which allows the separation of 2.5 MeV and 14 MeV neutrons in trace tritium plasmas. The first high-resolution 14 MeV neutron spectroscopy measurements in neutral beam injection-heated DT plasmas are presented, allowing thermal and non-thermal neutron component separation. Prospects for the diagnose of DT burning plasmas such as ITER and SPARC will be presented."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"64","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"16016","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["678f97f4fdbe835856b987d9","678f97f4fdbe835856b987da","678f97f4fdbe835856b987db","678f97f4fdbe835856b987dc","678f97f4fdbe835856b987dd","678f97f4fdbe835856b987de","678f97f4fdbe835856b987df","678f97f4fdbe835856b987e0","678f97f4fdbe835856b987e1","678f97f4fdbe835856b987e2","678f97f4fdbe835856b987e3","678f97f4fdbe835856b987e4","678f97f4fdbe835856b987e5","678f97f4fdbe835856b987e6","678f97f4fdbe835856b987e7","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"NUCLEAR FUSION","doi":"10.1088/issn.0029-5515","issn":"0029-5515","documentHash":"88422204-97ec-4fb6-bc55-866a72c6c2e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678f9849fdbe835856b9b457","year":"2024","volume":"64","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"8c24a748-4ddb-4479-bc8c-b9086731ed15"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["neutron spectroscopy","nuclear diagnostics","single crystal diamond detectors"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060534273"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678fa06efdbe835856ba8db3","name":"V.","lastName":"Gopakumar","documentHash":"47eccab1-f212-4268-ab25-6636ef455ea8"},{"objectId":"678fa06efdbe835856ba8db2","name":"F.J.","lastName":"Casson","documentHash":"fc602c77-52e1-43bd-8064-db3497e8b813"},{"objectId":"678fa06efdbe835856ba8db1","name":"J.","lastName":"Buchanan","documentHash":"4830ff81-e6aa-4c89-8e4e-25a877338fa1"},{"objectId":"678fa06efdbe835856ba8db0","name":"S.","lastName":"Pamela","documentHash":"92deebc6-7220-4d27-a841-2c904571813c"},{"objectId":"678fa06efdbe835856ba8daf","name":"J.","lastName":"Citrin","documentHash":"62de4b0a-8bfa-48b8-a083-e9ef2c23aed2"},{"objectId":"678fa06efdbe835856ba8dae","name":"T.","lastName":"Madula","documentHash":"aae4f897-9e1b-4b55-85ba-15bb29ce847b"},{"objectId":"678fa06efdbe835856ba8dad","name":"J.","lastName":"Barr","documentHash":"414eaf5c-1029-42ca-94a3-d98d8a3feb1a"},{"objectId":"678fa06efdbe835856ba8dac","name":"A.","lastName":"Ho","documentHash":"90f2d7c0-0bfd-499e-a18e-464a4a958b6f"},{"objectId":"678fa06efdbe835856ba8dab","name":"L.","lastName":"Zanisi","documentHash":"193d3968-9535-481d-938d-8ecdd8678f27"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397202","name":"BOHDAN","lastName":"BIEG","uuid":"824102936597EAEAFDC0CA005121E68A31F5CD249313BB3DE7A696711B7AF50AA39660B4406408C7C6F1876B2B4C60A29C04488145A12D92F4454003EDE7904F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3649-6349","documentHash":"4211ff14-2499-4712-b9b5-bf009f77c090"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-13","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"678fa06efdbe835856ba8da9","doi":"10.1088/1741-4326/ad240d","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ad240d","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Efficient training sets for surrogate models of tokamak turbulence with Active Deep Ensembles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Model-based plasma scenario development lies at the heart of the design and operation of future fusion powerplants. Including turbulent transport in integrated models is essential for delivering a successful roadmap towards operation of ITER and the design of DEMO-class devices. Given the highly iterative nature of integrated models, fast machine-learning-based surrogates of turbulent transport are fundamental to fulfil the pressing need for faster simulations opening up pulse design, optimization, and flight simulator applications. A significant bottleneck is the generation of suitably large training datasets covering a large volume in parameter space, which can be prohibitively expensive to obtain for higher fidelity codes. In this work, we propose ADEPT (Active Deep Ensembles for Plasma Turbulence), a physics-informed, two-stage Active Learning strategy to ease this challenge. Active Learning queries a given model by means of an acquisition function that identifies regions where additional data would improve the surrogate model. We provide a benchmark study using available data from the literature for the QuaLiKiz quasilinear transport model. We demonstrate quantitatively that the physics-informed nature of the proposed workflow reduces the need to perform simulations in stable regions of the parameter space, resulting in significantly improved data efficiency compared to non-physics informed approaches which consider a regression problem over the whole domain. We show an up to a factor of 20 reduction in training dataset size needed to achieve the same performance as random sampling. We then validate the surrogates on multichannel integrated modelling of ITG-dominated JET scenarios and demonstrate that they recover the performance of QuaLiKiz to better than 10%. This matches the performance obtained in previous work, but with two orders of magnitude fewer training data points."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"64","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"36022","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["678fa06efdbe835856ba8dab","678fa06efdbe835856ba8dac","678fa06efdbe835856ba8dad","678fa06efdbe835856ba8dae","678fa06efdbe835856ba8daf","678fa06efdbe835856ba8db0","678fa06efdbe835856ba8db1","678fa06efdbe835856ba8db2","678fa06efdbe835856ba8db3","5e709284878c28a047397202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479077","mniswId":"15227","title":"NUCLEAR FUSION","doi":"10.1088/issn.0029-5515","issn":"0029-5515","documentHash":"88422204-97ec-4fb6-bc55-866a72c6c2e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678fa06efdbe835856ba8daa","year":"2024","volume":"64","number":"3","documentHash":"9ed37541-b5c1-45bd-936d-8cc783faf3e3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tokamak","active learning","integrated model","surrogate model"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060534367"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6785ffbbfdbe834d98d64344","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Zhran","documentHash":"03b9dd1f-5bea-487e-b25f-06d5106cd615"},{"objectId":"6785ffbbfdbe834d98d64342","name":"Marta","lastName":"Szostak","documentHash":"fec4ca16-1293-448f-a27e-c90057508386"},{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b85d8","name":"Beata","lastName":"Całka","uuid":"624B18D9D13E15A616F27F7B4B6BD302655A5165C44855608F15A66A5EA96926C976C47EAAA30502372F9ED90F7B628022CC71B583E921A050F501F75CE4AD6F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7147-0849","documentHash":"1abbbab2-dc8c-483a-8111-1a79225a9334"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b51f2","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Siok","uuid":"3EB5BE3370ACCDE81DD8B90EECD4057ABF87FE395AC43BE4A9DAFC52009ED195638D27C2D32637881B9BA83E64F4E54719C45CF48012C9868937A04FBDC731A0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2773-6125","documentHash":"8293d4cf-8d91-4a0e-9b1f-746a41a51524"},{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739dfd1","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"KOGUT","uuid":"5B0C06ED610B72ADC9999A8189EC58450034280A4DF911965EE34C0EF6427633212D72185DA7FA1DEF78797F363EB6F47B7CD3270DA97DE7DCBD76FBAF481DD7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9646-275X","documentHash":"2a6638f6-93e3-4159-8be0-6971fcdca6dd"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393f80","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Bielecka","uuid":"FCB1CD89765BFC42E7A2124D8ADCA00E1A02A3426B8F391E5B1A8F96A3AFD5425FA86DB097E217026D8654CCDD0A6B7DCB4952A78DAA7492484880B9432ED70F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3255-1264","documentHash":"a492c9af-e32d-45d6-9665-db2ab5953b1f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-01-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6785ffbbfdbe834d98d64340","doi":"10.3390/su17020521","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/2/521","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Improvement of the Reliability of Urban Park Location Results Through the Use of Fuzzy Logic Theory","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Green areas, thanks to their relatively unified natural systems, play several key roles. They contribute to the proper functioning and sustainable development of cities and also determine the quality of life for their inhabitants. As a result, urban planners and policy-makers frequently aim to maximize the benefits of green spaces by creating various programs and strategies focused on green infrastructure development, such as the Green City initiative. One of the objectives of this program is to create new urban parks. This research focuses on developing a new method for selecting sites for urban parks, taking into account factors related to the environment, accessibility, and human activity. The research was carried out for the area of Ciechanów city. To make the city areas more attractive to residents, the authorities aim to increase green spaces and also revitalize the existing greenery. The combination of the Fuzzy AHP method and fuzzy set theory (selecting appropriate fuzzy membership for each factor), along with the use of large and diverse geospatial datasets, minimized subjectivity in prioritizing criteria and allowed for a fully automated analysis process. Among the factors analyzed, land use emerged as the most significant, followed by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and proximity to surface water. The results indicated that 16% of the area was deemed highly suitable for urban park development, while 15% was considered unsuitable. One-at-a-time (OAT) sensitivity analysis, based on changes in the weight of the land-use factor, revealed that a 75% reduction in weight resulted in a nearly 57.2% decrease in unsuitable areas, while a 75% increase in weight led to a 40% expansion of the most suitable locations. The potential park locations were compared with a heat map of urban activity in the city. The developed method contributes to the discourse on the transparency of location decisions and the validity of the criteria used, to promote sustainable urban development that provides residents with access to active recreation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1e4","uid":"bkbp2VYA4xopaIA4HrQlzTQ","uuid":"21621076-b7f2-4bc3-a5a5-e684c8630041","name":"Wydział Inżynierii Lądowej i Geodezji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709438878c28a0473b85d8","5e709408878c28a0473b51f2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d8878c28a04739dfd1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"521","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709438878c28a0473b85d8","5e709408878c28a0473b51f2","6785ffbbfdbe834d98d64342","5e709256878c28a047393f80","5e7092d8878c28a04739dfd1","6785ffbbfdbe834d98d64344"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"46882d20-8996-4dde-bd15-7d5f8ecc797a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6785ffbbfdbe834d98d64341","year":"2025","volume":"17","number":"2","documentHash":"71330fd4-f0cb-4738-9163-28c7011affd1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["green city","sustainable development","fuzzy set theory","F-AHP"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060538022"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa43d","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Połap","uuid":"007C8E273B4C1D2D1CC836D7BF1D5F40DACC697D799BA3879B1FD8EC5213D60522418AB5597142EDFC58B0AC30EB95B360CDE089B2DB065946660A32404EBB11","orcidId":"0000-0003-1972-5979","documentHash":"106cef1d-4510-4f9e-a83c-a4a1fd2893b3"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a5f8b","name":"NATALIA","lastName":"WAWRZYNIAK","uuid":"02EB092A7DE32EBF2E5CE506F1E2FA7906BA319CC584B5B91273EAFE83591249147B1B51C579E4F23E7B6CD548BAC57725D920ACC7DAA39E91FF399F5A71B922","orcidId":"0000-0002-4429-7163","documentHash":"5262da22-ca8c-40d7-8997-ed42eeac63be"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c4","name":"MARTA","lastName":"WŁODARCZYK-SIELICKA","uuid":"E2672257D6548CB96A156323A538F169F850F21A9FCDF2CCE6C1D494DF5C18285AB32B3B9087F4704502FEE31B5D7C1D165D35505CD85ED9DCF844B04A45FD6D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7489-8437","documentHash":"e1658e70-952e-4244-bb79-494498fb1350"}],"objectId":"61bcf5de2467f07b6bfb131e","doi":"10.1016/j.isatra.2021.04.003","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isatra.2021.04.003","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Automatic ship classification for a riverside monitoring system using a cascade of artificial intelligence techniques including penalties and rewards","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Riverside monitoring systems are used for controlling the passage of ships, counting them to prevent overcrowding in a port, or raising an alarm if the ship is unknown or not safe.

The main advantage is the possibility of continually increasing the amount of knowledge during system operation. However, overtraining is possible, so each time, the best classifier is chosen. Another advantage for practical use is the small database, which allows for the quick and practical implementation of such a system.

However, it also creates challenges, including congestion, parking space occupation, pollution, and accidents involving freight vehicles. This paper employs partial least squares structural equation modeling to explore the cause-and-effect relationships between urban freight transport issues and initiatives from the citizens’ perspective. The study analyzes six causal relationships in two cities – Belo Horizonte, Brazil, representing the Global South, and Szczecin, Poland, representing the Global North – while considering their geographic, socioeconomic, and political contexts. The findings reveal that citizens’ perceptions of freight-related issues influence their views on city logistics initiatives and their perceived effectiveness In Belo Horizonte, infrastructure problems, particularly those related to pedestrian and cyclist safety, are considered more significant compared to Szczecin, where environmental issues, such as pollution, have a more prominent latent perception. The comparative analysis underscores causal relationships between urban flow challenges and freight problems, demonstrating that urban flow issues are more critical than infrastructure or environmental concerns in both cities. Differences also emerge in the perceived effectiveness of initiatives: while truck restrictions are highly valued in Belo Horizonte, loading and unloading areas and clearer signage are more impactful in Szczecin. Green initiatives show potential for promoting sustainable urban freight transport in both contexts. However, the limited variability in citizens’ responses, particularly in Szczecin, suggests a consensus on the relevance of the proposed initiatives. The results offer dual benefits: providing direct recommendations for Belo Horizonte and serving as a benchmark for Szczecin and other cities adopting an adaptive approach to urban logistics. These insights can guide policymakers in fostering efficient and sustainable urban freight transport through a participatory planning process in Global South and North."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972ad","5e709284878c28a047397203"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"101342","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67a34071fdbe833baf123fd7","5e709285878c28a0473972ad","5e709284878c28a047397203","67a34071fdbe833baf123fd8","67a34071fdbe833baf123fd9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f51b","mniswId":"28919","title":"Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives","eissn":"2590-1982","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"733f42d2-788c-498e-94bf-bed34ad0d845"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67a34071fdbe833baf123fd6","year":"2025","volume":"29","documentHash":"9585e553-d9c9-4c2c-9923-9ff7a829dfe4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["urban freight transport","stakeholders","citizen","structural equation modelling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060572423"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6799d86efdbe831aedc7b918","name":"Brunon","lastName":"Rzepka","documentHash":"6e5e1dd4-3d64-4ae9-9867-c536a4e51b6c"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972d3","name":"MIROSŁAW","lastName":"WIELGOSZ","uuid":"D5DA71FE039FE94ADA12D6EB4673C88AB2AE064C97C33707C84AA841621BDC4A78872E9977E9FFD0B8AADC0C74EE6201C6C2B505BEA3A8FE500A1E1F77FC64B1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3113-5018","documentHash":"24582178-134c-426d-95e6-5429e07183ce"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397219","name":"MARZENA","lastName":"MAŁYSZKO","uuid":"4CA492C2FD8509090AD81F3CC9D7C879C5C41ED4BBE61FA36DD95C4D8D7BF9087DB48C56DF3FC6086DDD73EF622DB4A78A860C96755B9C19AC2E04B2845AE582","orcidId":"0000-0001-5392-714X","documentHash":"0d9e8305-6eeb-46be-8a12-e15d596c14fb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-01-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6799d86efdbe831aedc7b917","doi":"10.3390/app15020996","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/2/996/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Functionality of the Search and Rescue Transponder (SART) in Maritime Search and Rescue Actions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this article, the authors present contemporary problems in search and rescue operations at sea.

A pivotal move towards energy-efficient and sustainable systems is essential to mitigate these challenges. In this landscape, machine learning (ML), and particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs), emerge as powerful tools for effectively addressing these urban complexities. This comprehensive review zeroes in on the deployment of RNNs within sustainable urban transportation and logistics, highlighting their adeptness in processing sequential data, a critical component in various forecasting and optimization tasks. We commence with a foundational understanding of RNNs, segueing into their successful applications in urban transport and logistics. This review also critically examines the constraints of current methodologies and potential avenues for enhancement. We scrutinize the application of RNNs across several areas, encompassing the energy shift in both passenger and freight transport, logistics management, integration of low- and zero-emission vehicles, and the energy dynamics of transport and logistics. Additionally, the role of RNNs in traffic and infrastructure planning is explored, particularly in forecasting traffic flow, congestion patterns, and optimizing energy usage. The crux of this review is to amalgamate and present the existing knowledge on the instrumental role of RNNs in facilitating the transition to energy-efficient urban transportation and logistics. Our goal is to highlight effective strategies, pinpoint challenges, and map out avenues for future research in this domain."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f902","uid":"bk_n03ydqnhCQzeW0cj586g","uuid":"dae78b8a-6bdd-4a4c-aeba-e3409b15c413","name":"Instytut Nauk o Morzu i Środowisku","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b52b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","6268aaaa7523406b88cecdd6","602f697d9543c7410626f451"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"78","issue":"150","pagesFromTo":"131-149","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6268aaaa7523406b88cecdd6","5e7092b7878c28a04739b52b","602f697d9543c7410626f451","5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","675f9eb8ece39855f73cb2fe"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a6e6","mniswId":"18270","title":"Scientific Journals of the Maritime University of Szczecin-Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii Morskiej w Szczecinie","issn":"1733-8670","eissn":"2392-0378","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fdb820fa-cedd-41fe-95cd-b3a078aeeee6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66618c4b409707458fb4c853","year":"2024","volume":"78","number":"150","documentHash":"cb7ce777-d15f-4454-820a-55f6520ee674"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["traffic flow prediction","infrastructure planning","Energy efficiency","energy transition","traffic management","sustainable urban transport","machine learning","zero-emission vehicles","ecurrent neural networks"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060585768"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c06858fdbe8328ca66e8bd","name":"Edison","lastName":"Gundabattini","documentHash":"3d767a2e-7934-46c5-a223-e4f5a719b027"},{"objectId":"67c06858fdbe8328ca66e8bc","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Cierzniewski","documentHash":"18d46a33-7739-4fd4-9909-cfe5dfeedb38"},{"objectId":"67c06858fdbe8328ca66e8bb","name":"Michal","lastName":"Cichowicz","documentHash":"4a6e49b8-27ce-45a4-b6fe-62bf98f087f0"},{"objectId":"67c06858fdbe8328ca66e8ba","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Wardach","documentHash":"2b38d75c-39e0-4749-9434-90692fb6aa91"},{"objectId":"67c06858fdbe8328ca66e8b9","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Paplicki","documentHash":"f4d85ff6-e0ab-435c-8bea-1efcdcd7f7f9"},{"objectId":"67c06858fdbe8328ca66e8b8","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Palka","documentHash":"b9d507bc-ed56-4ffe-b646-681e68793945"},{"objectId":"5e7093ad878c28a0473aee79","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Prajzendanc","uuid":"C4A2720E3250798C2E17DE8506756E85108BDC7AD3D157CBC1D896F6AEFDCFF768D3572194BD9CEB595CC0021DE36D02CD274FEF2FDB98695D4B96B9EADDC85A","orcidId":"0000-0002-1662-4390","documentHash":"f611e8d7-e98a-442c-a11f-189ef12b60d5"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739722d","name":"LECH","lastName":"DOROBCZYŃSKI","uuid":"C288151E46DB81947D7A8C31B905BC563750794556E56A43E4ACF1C623ADE8A5D7DACF8CB564F2BF341AAB62B4732C2E2AE86FEF20E3F1872FA8DF25A3DC4B41","orcidId":"0000-0001-8388-8700","documentHash":"37c0d642-f93b-40a4-94f1-fc71b0a3a24e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"67c06858fdbe8328ca66e8b6","doi":"10.3390/electronics13112219","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/11/2219/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Improving the Efficiency of the Axial Flux Machine with Hybrid Excitation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper discusses the construction and operating principle of an axial flux electric machine with hybrid excitation.

Currently, many scientific publications deal with the topic of electromobility from the point of view of the available infrastructure, however, the issues of energy suppliers for charging vehicles are neglected. Therefore, special consideration was given to introducing the most important entities operating on the Polish market in the context of an attempt to determine their market share and the scope of services offered. The first part of the article presents the current state of publicly available electric vehicle charging stations in Poland, along with a description of the most commonly used chargers. The year-on-year growth dynamics of \npublicly available charging points is presented. For example, comparing data for July of 2023 and 2024 in the year-on-year system, the increase was as high as 76%. In the second part of the article, a comparative analysis of energy suppliers in terms of their offer and capabilities was carried out, paying particular attention to the technical and organizational solutions they use. It was found that the market of energy suppliers focuses on the main five players. On the other hand, the market of operators, in addition to the three main players (ENEA, Orlen Charge and Tauron), is fragmented. Based on the analysis conducted, the dependencies and difficulties faced by energy suppliers to ensure an adequate level of service and the availability of charging infrastructure were identified."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a489"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574186e","mniswId":"862","fullName":"International Business Information Management","shortName":"IBIMA","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"6029aca7-ff4d-42fd-9ba3-6932a546725d"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"67728241fdbe831a38829c63","startDate":"2024-11-27","endDate":"2024-11-28","fullName":"44th International Business Information Management Association Conference","shortName":"44th IBIMA Conference","city":"Grenada","country":"ES","website":"https://ibima.org/conference/44th-ibima-conference/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"15f9bb7f-40ae-4561-a94f-075e3d78d212"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a04739734d","5e70946c878c28a0473bcafc","5e7092ab878c28a04739a489"]},"journal":{"objectId":"617a7d522467f06b9dda3243","title":"IBIMA","issn":"2767-9640","websiteLink":"https://ibima.org/","documentHash":"d120145b-dc72-4b47-ba40-673d0f2c6606"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["electric vehicles","electro-mobility","charging infrastructure","energy suppliers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060604741"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c7","name":"NATALIA","lastName":"WAGNER","uuid":"26E53CDC2FD3099002948F30AA2D35392306E07B07818599B3E7D17A8D7F2EE9ED0B1B30B78FCD2C46741A3A2084611956C050ED59175CB2D0CBFD32C7925C1D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6898-4737","documentHash":"ba5e1d6d-7560-4ad8-9072-54e365477c50"}],"objectId":"67c9525cfdbe8348f3bd0542","doi":"10.1016/j.esd.2025.101686","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0973082625000365?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Towards sustainable maritime transport: Focus on the early phase of technology development related to alternative fuels","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Transition towards sustainable maritime transport and the move away from fossil fuels is one of the greatest challenges faced by this industry today. This paper aims to evaluate technological advances in alternative fuels and energy sources-related technologies in maritime transport. Data from patent databases was analysed to assess that research issue. A comparative analysis of ten types of alternative fuels/energy sources in maritime transport was conducted in the context of technology potential and technology S-curve. Identifying the current status of technological knowledge is necessary for planning and conducting an effective research policy. The results show that the patent-based maturity rate of alternative maritime fuels/energy sources varies between 26.4 % and 91.7 % of the saturation level of current invention curves fitted separately for each fuel type using a logistic curve model. Biofuels, wind, and LNG are characterised by the highest patent-based maturity rates. In accordance with the concept of successive S-curves in technology development, wind and biofuels-based technologies in particular can be expected to change their shape of the invention curve. Among zero-emission fuels, technologies based on methanol, ammonia, battery, and hydrogen require further urgent intensive research work. Achieving the right level of technology maturity for all alternative fuels is essential for business entities to decide freely about choosing the best ones for investments in the maritime industry."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"85","pagesFromTo":"101686","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972c7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ab3","mniswId":"5684","title":"Energy for Sustainable Development","issn":"0973-0826","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"eb8d1d06-4417-471d-a5cd-3d4146108b56"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c9525cfdbe8348f3bd0543","year":"2025","volume":"85","documentHash":"980bde89-473a-47b4-b1cb-762cf6933f9f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable maritime transport","sustainable shipping","alternative fuels","patent analysis","technology development"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060611279"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972ce","name":"MAŁGORZATA","lastName":"SZYSZKO","uuid":"B2A0447D2D6DD8983415B4BDE466178E12BF7B5CC613316B13CCBEFEC3B04F36A24C213BF53E08EF4A698F86CCA405EC2211BFB5A660E6931E67605F1B9411BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-3336-4519","documentHash":"fd8038d0-4a42-4a68-a6dc-423ac875b90c"}],"objectId":"67af15aefdbe8332768ca579","publicUri":"http://www1.up.poznan.pl/agrifoodlogistics/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Agrifood.pdf","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Possibilities and limitations in the carriage of agricultural machineries by maritime transport as a containerized cargo","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In recent years in Poland it has been recorded a large share of agricultural machinery exports to overseas countries, therefore this chapter presents the issues of the transport of agricultural machinery, both new and already in operation, from the sender to the recipient, with particular emphasis on maritime transport.

The operation of marine slow-speed engines with low sulphur fuels is associated with an elevated risk of cylinder liner scuffing. Establishing the appropriate cylinder oil feed rates is essential to avoid the potential consequences of using low sulphur fuels. The research was carried out on three slow-speed marine engines in real operating conditions. The paper presents the research results conducted to develop, using a planned experiment methodology and engine scavenge drain oil analysis, a practical aid for the operation of engines with acceptable cylinder liners wear rates and, at the same time, rational total cylinder oil usage. Until now, there has been no clear technical recommendation as to what cylinder lubricating oil feed rates should be used for slow-speed, two-stroke marine engines operating using low sulphur Fuel Oil, considering cylinder liners wear rates. The developed prediction models were verified in the real-life operation of two low-speed engines. Tests confirmed that developed prediction models can be applied in the real operation of engines. Obtained models can be used in the “supervised machine learning” process. Obtained predictive models as operators’ tools to maintain acceptable cylinder liner wear ratios are published for the first time; similar research had not previously been undertaken."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397218"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"247","pagesFromTo":"116838","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397218"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebffa82ad49b31ccec80c90","title":"MEASUREMENT","issn":"0263-2241","documentHash":"167c06a5-18b3-490e-8db3-8683480b1f24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6799d661fdbe831aedc7937d","year":"2025","volume":"247","documentHash":"1c9d82c3-20f2-498b-b839-da2e322fd7a5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cylinder oil feed rate","scavenge drain oil","prediction models"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060645834"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67af4513fdbe8332768e9f3b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Stawicki","documentHash":"dabb7365-2ce8-4eb0-b956-1588a0e1cb12"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a0473994f0","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"FRANKOWSKI","uuid":"5D8C0899AA6F6CB10454C9AD98C143ED4AAF7229A7F0698EE461B6FA8977EF2E473D3182348D5D79184C6CBC05EE77E98F638FD1F29AF45BADCAC68F13AE9E58","orcidId":"0000-0002-3652-1233","documentHash":"13af6734-a4b1-4467-998a-bc3cdc90b19e"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972b8","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"MAJZNER","uuid":"032C6A9389B15AF91EBE5520A8744FDDBF8266DC7963B5C99515F110D7986111A07D80C763D676EF21C1B710C91A3CB856E2A2E74DE77263660C0526B00B4351","orcidId":"0000-0002-7543-4263","documentHash":"88bf2776-96b9-4ee4-a0ec-053b943375fc"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397273","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"MĄKA","uuid":"32196EF592F7563D17EFCA642F762F53E0F35E549328424C7A01B0201D69D57C0EC2834E1AE4D87AC0A2E1B697B31E14FA10965B965C6DC71161279F0F3AB156","orcidId":"0000-0002-1477-2445","documentHash":"38b4b17a-1c45-41d3-8835-865e9dd18a21"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"67af4513fdbe8332768e9f3a","doi":"10.3390/app142411965","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/24/11965/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Non-Destructive Evaluation of Reinforced Concrete Structures with Magnetic Flux Leakage and Eddy Current Methods—Comparative Analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article evaluates two essential non-destructive electromagnetic techniques, magnetic flux leakage (MFL) and eddy current (EC) methods, and their effectiveness in assessing the basic parameters of reinforced concrete (RC).

Subsequently, the measurement results are analyzed, and association rules are extracted to demonstrate the relationships between variations in the physical parameters of the tested structure and the features of the measured waveforms. Finally, similar identification models are implemented, and the obtained identification results are compared. The paper documents and details all phases of this research. The findings indicate that while the operational principles of both methods are similar, the techniques differ significantly in terms of their measurement systems’ complexity and usability. The eddy current (EC) method exhibits superior spatial resolution, whereas the magnetic method is more straightforward and offers a greater effective range and favorable association rules. Consequently, it is recommended that both techniques be utilized for different structures and in varying contexts. The techniques’ advantages, disadvantages, and limitations are discussed in this work and supported by the measurement results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397273","5e70929f878c28a0473994f0","5e709285878c28a0473972b8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"11965","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929f878c28a0473994f0","5e709285878c28a0473972b8","5e709284878c28a047397273","67af4513fdbe8332768e9f3b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff33dad49b31ccec0104f","title":"Applied Sciences","issn":"2076-3417","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"96f827ef-c2c8-4b76-ab17-c7357fffee4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6760a3c2fdbe834e36ad87b0","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"24","documentHash":"ce79e335-711a-4e00-97b9-0f39ecee65c6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["feature extraction","machine learning","nondestructive testing NDT","rebars","reinforced concrete","reinforcement bar evaluation","parameter identification","magnetic flux leakage (MFL) method","anisotropic magneto resistance (AMR) sensor","association rule extraction"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060645916"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972de","name":"BOGUSZ","lastName":"WIŚNICKI","uuid":"FDB4CE7E72F1233633E17C80AF596BB2C76676FBEAB8CE0D22254723C9CF4EE0CE9F5024F91CEB5BA04CB2F9901A2AADCE8AABDF77DBA594304D915A812EFAB0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2932-8969","documentHash":"2367c965-7bc4-4748-bbe7-1d8d418a1b10"}],"objectId":"67af02effdbe8332768b9113","publicUri":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991053107937205066&context=L&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&lang=pl&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=LibraryCatalog&query=any,contains,978-83-7789-742-3&offset=0","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Kontenery do transportu żywności","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Monografia kompleksowo charakteryzuje transport samochodowy żywności w warunkach chłodniczych.

materials (CRMs). Here, we report results of polymetallic nodules from the H22_NE block of the Interoceanmetal (IOM) exploration area in the eastern part of the Clarion–Clipperton Zone (CCZ), NE Pacific Ocean. The polymetallic nodules were studied with X-ray Diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, SEM-EDS, and LA-ICP-MS (bulk nodules and in situ nodule layers). Additionally, we combine geochemical data of polymetallic nodules with the previously reported data of pore waters and sediments from six stations. Our study aims to define the mineral composition and determine the content of CRMs in the polymetallic nodules and to assess the main factors controlling metal deposition and nodule enrichment in some CRMs. Mn content and the Mn/Fe ratio of the nodules classify them mostly as mixed hydrogenetic–diagenetic type. They are also enriched in Ni, Cu, Co, Zn, Mo, W, Li, Tl, and REE. The in situ REE patterns exhibit MREE and HREE enrichment and a variable Ce anomaly that argues for a changing oxic/suboxic environment and periodically changing of diagenetic and hydrogenetic nodule growth. The results of the joint study of the bottom sediments, pore waters, and polymetallic nodules show a complexity of processes that influence the formation of these deposits. The changing oxic and anoxic conditions are well documented in the chemistry of the nodule layers. Probably the most important controlling factors are sedimentation rate, bioturbation, adsorption, desorption, and oxidation. In addition, growth rates, water depth variations, electro-chemical speciation, phosphatization, and the structures of the Fe-Mn adsorbents are also considered. The polymetallic nodule deposits in the IOM contract area are estimated for future mining for Ni, Cu, Co, and Mn resources. They, however, contain additional metals of economic importance, such as REE and other trace elements (referred to as CRMs) that are potential by-products for metal mining.

market is the increased interest in hybrid cars. Hybrid cars combine a standard internal combustion engine with an electric motor solution. Research into increasing the energy efficiency of a conventional unit while meeting increasingly stringent exhaust emission standards is becoming a key postulate in this matter. This article discusses an analysis of modifying the fuel used by hybrid vehicles using the example of a selected drive unit equipped with a spark-ignition engine. This effect was tested after the Eco Fuel Shot liquid catalyst was added to the fuel. The research process was carried out in two stages, as follows: in road conditions using the Dynomet road dynamometer; and on the V-tech VT4/B2 chassis dynamometer. Tests were carried out to replicate road tests with a catalytic additive in the fuel. A mathematical model was created and the following energy efficiency parameters of the hybrid vehicle were calculated: the torque of the internal combustion engine, electric motor, and generator; the rotational speeds of the internal combustion engine, electric motor, and generator; the power of the internal combustion engine, electric motor, and generator; the equivalent fuel consumption of the electric motor and generator; the fuel consumption of the internal combustion engine, electric motor, and generator; and the mileage fuel consumption of the internal combustion engine, electric motor, and generator. The results of the tests made it possible to identify the benefits of using the tested liquid catalyst on the operation of the drive system of the analyzed hybrid vehicle. This research will be of benefit to both the demand side in the form of users of this category of vehicles, and the supply side represented by the manufacturers of power units."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a04739726b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"5138","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6718f0f9fdbe8353f7603d64","6718f0f9fdbe8353f7603d65","6718f0f9fdbe8353f7603d66","6718f0f9fdbe8353f7603d67","6718f0f9fdbe8353f7603d68","6718f0f9fdbe8353f7603d69","5e709284878c28a04739726b","6718f0f9fdbe8353f7603d6a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6718a993fdbe8353f7589f5c","year":"2024","volume":"17","number":"20","documentHash":"c4126a68-fc57-48c3-941f-ea8834141c75"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["internal combustion engine","hybrid vehicle","drive cycle analysis","simulation and comparison"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060648861"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af745","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Kuczyński","uuid":"A739CD75FB304B71A76E44B630808AD197E6CB2E4F70E8AB232B842FDC4FEB5CC5C3EE76F56796981F2322EF4D96FCD9A1D164BF78238C86809A93179A340C7C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7723-7650","documentHash":"0000c568-beab-4015-ab52-61d92707e36d"},{"objectId":"5e7092f2878c28a04739fabf","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Chmiel","uuid":"8B5752C307C83D715C4245CBEEFCC6A9E6D2FAFCAF3A21E88C6F301D6993473065D2A8CF09BC943BC986C8D32ABB0FEAE1169DF1AB7063DB7C77519B88F46219","documentHash":"ad4821ec-f965-43da-993b-2ca8146edbf7"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ad","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Michalska-Pożoga","uuid":"19ED15396DFB6C98CDE5CBCE61DFE034C6536F15A642BD5B87960E9CE3D1FE3A2ECAA7D978C722BD781EBF7C0BF2401E1F103B890E2B1A7499A80F2F1759A61C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6119-568X","documentHash":"77ad1eef-9bca-43a2-a899-bc5b0cb66274"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6639b7214097077c1aa03e2f","doi":"10.24425/ather.2023.149737","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/149737/edition/131167/content","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Overview of application options for vertical axis wind turbines","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents an analysis of the use of Savonius wind turbines with vertical axis of rotation.

The nodule samples were collected from the seabed of the Pacific Ocean, within the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, approximately 2000 kilometres west of Mexico. The activity concentration of U-238 in the studied samples ranged from 9 to 51 Bq/kg. The mean activity concentration of the other radionuclides, Ra-226, Pb-214, Bi-214, and Pb-210, was found to be at comparable levels at 350, 321, 323, and 287 Bq/kg, respectively. Also investigated was the potential radiological hazard to individuals involved in the storing and processing of the nodules, resulting from the radioactive decay of Ra-226 contained in the nodules. It was concluded that the effective dose limit (20 mSv) for individuals occupationally exposed to radioactive material can be exceeded in the case of prolonged and close contact with large quantities of nodules.

Each year more and more terminals are released on the market, with the smartphone being the most popular among them. They include low-end, mid-range, and of course high-end devices, with top hardware specifications. They do vary in build quality, utilized type of material, screen size and screen technology, but the biggest differentiator relates with the CPU (Central Processing Unit), GPU (Graphical Processing Unit), RAM (Random-Access Memory), as well as integrated wireless connectivity modules. Another issue is the type of installed software, particularly the OS (Operating System). Nowadays, two operating systems share approx. 90% of the mobile market, that is iOS from Apple and Android from Google. The first one is a closed environment, dedicated only to devices coming from one man ufacturer. The fragmentation and distribution of different OSs is very low. The price range of different smartphone versions is quite high for a typical user. The second one is an open environment, available on numerous devices coming from various manufacturers. Additionally, this OS may be changed or modified by any interested third-party, which would like to implement, e.g., their own GUI (Graphical User Interface), etc. The fragmentation and distribution of different OSs is very large. The price range of smartphones available on the market is vast. The question remains which option proofs better in terms of quality for the end user. One may assume that if a given solution is intended as a dedicated one, meaning that it is designed to operate on a limited number of, i.e., hardware configurations, it should prove to be more effective. The battery lifetime, stability and efficiency is expected to be high. If some solution is universal, meaning that it could operate on barely any hardware configuration, it would eventually prove to be less effective, less stable, and with a lower expected battery lifetime. This aspect would surely be an interesting hypothesis to investigate."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac079"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5b9d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"492","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741969","mniswId":"1131","fullName":"International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networks and Services","shortName":"Mobiquitous","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"a2966e24-589d-4a9a-8d00-098d28c38996"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"64d0eef24097077ac15d9813","startDate":"2022-11-14","endDate":"2022-11-17","fullName":"International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networks and Services","shortName":"International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networks and Services","city":"Pittsburgh","country":"US","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"a0478fb6-9913-49b7-8343-b7c48fb14752"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709388878c28a0473ac079","5e709411878c28a0473b5b9d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e72e822467f01e93131c5b","title":"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering","issn":"1867-8211","documentHash":"baafe8a5-b8af-4596-928a-177ad149ba5a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c00849fdbe8328ca5f2808","year":"2023","volume":"492","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"5121ab75-0e68-40a4-9f50-d41fe5fe90b7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mobile devices","Quality of Service","multimedia","QoE (Quality of Experience)","Wireless Networks"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060696617"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67bf0242fdbe8332277f45ed","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Wójcik","documentHash":"2d86afd0-29df-4e2a-8c6f-056c3d62ae2b"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-02-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"67bf0242fdbe8332277f45ec","doi":"10.3390/en18051038","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/18/5/1038/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Evaluation of Rheological and Lubrication Properties of Selected Alcohol Fuels","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article presents the results of a study on the rheological and lubricating properties of selected alcohol fuels. Methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol are investigated, for which density, kinematic, and dynamic viscosity are determined at selected temperatures in the range of 15–60 °C. In addition, the water content of the studied fuels is determined. Based on the measurements, the coefficient of temperature change for density and the relative percentage decrease in kinematic viscosity with increasing temperature are calculated. Subsequently, regression models are built to describe the value of density and viscosity of the tested liquid alcohol fuels as a function of temperature. Next, the fuels under study are subjected to the evaluation of antiwear properties using a high-frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR). For each fuel, the corrected wear scar size WS1.4, which is a measure of lubricity, the average coefficient of friction, and the relative percentage decrease in oil FILM thickness during the conduct of the HFRR test under standardized conditions, are determined. The measurements are carried out at a standardized temperature of 25 °C in accordance with standardized methods for a time equal to 75 min. Due to the low lubricity of the tested fuels, additional tests are performed at a reduced time equal to 30 min. In this case, all fuels show a similar WS1.4 value, which ranges from 384 μm for methanol through 422 μm for 2-propanol to 426 μm for ethanol. The wear marks on the samples after the execution of the test are used to draw additional qualitative conclusions about the lubricating properties of the tested alcohols. The results obtained are summarized, and possibilities for their use in further research are provided."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c8","5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1038","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245","67bf0242fdbe8332277f45ed","5e709285878c28a0473972c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67bdade2fdbe830b4eaca90b","year":"2025","publishedYear":2025,"volume":"18","number":"5","documentHash":"06682450-8603-4655-b71c-2aab7143d08c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["methanol","tribological wear","viscosity","high-frequency reciprocating rig","alcohol fuel","HFRR test"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060696677"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62f36640409707058d1b5420","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Falkowski-Gilski","documentHash":"e4719441-6bd1-4fdd-aed0-91fd6faec6fd"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5b9d","name":"TADEUSZ","lastName":"UHL","uuid":"473D39C8E7F1CAABD48E0C5827230EA1B91FA26A55D6763386454C45D8743DBA67AFAE55B76546207E732FCB6F94CDBC50C7E7DAA17564024031FD0BB4BB1FFA","orcidId":"0000-0001-6849-9168","documentHash":"2d110101-78bb-434b-ac0b-b152055b559f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62f36640409707058d1b541f","publicUri":"https://repository.am.szczecin.pl/handle/123456789/2717","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Cellular network quality evaluation at a university campus on the eve of 5G","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Thanks to the availability of mobile devices and the spread of broadband access around the world, the number of network users continues to grow. This has raised user awareness when it comes to the quality of content they consume. Many service providers and operators focus on monitoring QoN (Quality of Network) and QoS (Quality of Service) parameters, particularly those influenced by bandwidth and latency. However, for most end-users, quality is understood as the subjective QoE (Quality of Experience), a mixture of several individual factors. This paper presents a QoN evaluation, carried out under real-time operating conditions at a university campus, considering the overall performance of the cellular network. The study involved 50 mobile devices, i.e., smartphones, used by students during their typical activity throughout a week. The results were gathered on the eve of 5G, using a custom-built Android application. This application enabled the acquisition of valuable data about the wireless link, including download and upload speed, latency (pink), the ID of the serving base station, and type of cellular connection.

Gyrocompass errors are randomly oscillating in nature, and it is difficult to describe the behaviour of a gyrocompass sufficiently accurately using mathematical relationships. Fibre-optic gyroscopes have no mechanical components, so the variability in their indications has a different nature; the computational processes and inertial sensors used cause certain types of errors. T hus far, compass studies have focused on presenting absolute errors in the time domain. However, compasses exhibit specific characteristics in the frequency domain that affect the amplitude of their deviation. This leads to the issue of identifying the oscillatory spectrum of errors in the operation of such compasses, and how this spectrum is impacted by the dynamic movement of the vessel. We attempt to assess this phenomenon by means of measurements taken on board the training and research vessel M/S NAWIGATOR XXI. The application of a fast Fourier transform allows for calculation of the absolute compass errors in the frequency domain, meaning that the frequency of occurrence of errors can be observed as noise against the background of the useful signal. Our results confirm the value of applying a finite impulse response filter, which is used to filter out noise in the form of absolute compass errors from the useful signal background. The convolution function proposed here considerably extends the possibilities for analysing the signal spectrum in the frequency domain when testing for the accuracy of compass device indications, and enables the elimination of random errors with a low frequency of occurrence.."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972cd","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b03"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","uid":"bGA_QwQGoDNg-6MMEBxlWNQ","uuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","name":"Akademia Marynarki Wojennej im.

Light nuclei, such as deuterium and tritium, undergo a fusion reaction that releases energy, making fusion a promising option for a sustainable and clean energy source. Tokamak plasmas, however, are prone to disruptions as a result of a sudden collapse of the system terminating the fusion reactions. As disruptions lead to an abrupt loss of confinement, they can cause irreversible damage to present-day fusion devices and are expected to have a more devastating effect in future devices. Disruptions expected in the next-generation tokamak, ITER, for example, could cause electromagnetic forces larger than the weight of an Airbus A380. Furthermore, the thermal loads in such an event could exceed the melting threshold of the most resistant state-of-the-art materials by more than an order of magnitude.

UMVs (Unmanned Marine Vehicles) are unmanned vessels that can navigate autonomously or remotely, carry payloads, and be disposable or repairable. UMV networks are formations of autonomous vessels without a command, capable of carrying payloads. Technologies to suppress and counter UMVs have become kye areas of research. Jamming disrupts multi-channel GNSS receivers with noise, disabling UMVs’ positioning. This article discusses suppressing UMVs navigation and countermeasures. The cybersecurity of UAVs under conditions of partial or complete interruption of several GNSS signals due to jamming and/or spoofing cannot be calculated by analytical methods, but the results of predicting the movement of the UMVs under extreme conditions can be obtained using simulation methods at the design stage of the UMVs. The main goal of the article is to increase the cybersecurity of unmanned marine vehicles in extreme conditions of partial or complete interruption of GNSS signals in general and especially because of jamming and/or spoofing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6d","uid":"bIyN9cy073sy-77ulzW-Vmw","uuid":"bafdd534-9afd-4d8d-9412-30dc2d48ab6b","name":"Akademia im.

This paper presents the finite element modeling of plywood panels’ dynamic properties. Two panels differing in thickness were analyzed: (i) 18 mm and (ii) 27 mm. The developed models consisted of individual layers of wood, which were discretized using three-dimensional finite elements formulated using an orthotropic material model. The models were subjected to an updating procedure based on experimentally determined frequency response functions. As a result of a model updating relative errors for natural frequencies obtained numerically and experimentally were not exceeding 2.0%, on average 0.7% for 18 mm thick panel and not exceeding 2.6%, on average 1.5% for 27 mm thick panel. To prove the utility of the method and at the same time to validate it, a model of a cabinet was built, which was then subjected to experimental verification.

This forces responsible organizations to look for solutions, including local transport, that would be more environmentally friendly. Highly developed cities replace buses with combustion engines for those with electric drives, which eliminates harmful pollutants. The electrification trend is also followed by small, single-track vehicles. Increasingly, touring bikes and scooters are powered by electric motors supplied by batteries. The motivation for writing this article was the need to develop the technology of electric machines for drives of light vehicles. This paper presents and describes some types of electrical vehicles available on the market and their drives. This was the starting point for the development (Ansys Maxwell) of a new electric motor technology that could be applied to light vehicles. According to the imposed requirements, the motor should have the following parameters: torque – 0.49 Nm, maximum speed – 5151 rpm, power at least 270 W. Moreover, a process of motor’s computer modelling with SolidWorks has also been used, leading to construction of motor’s prototype.

The most promising route to fusion envisages the confinement of such plasmas with magnetic fields, whose most studied configuration is the tokamak. Disruptions are catastrophic collapses affecting all tokamak devices and one of the main potential showstoppers on the route to a commercial reactor. In this work we report how, deploying innovative analysis methods on thousands of JET experiments covering the isotopic compositions from hydrogen to full tritium and including the major D-T campaign, the nature of the various forms of collapse is investigated in all phases of the discharges. An original approach to proximity detection has been developed, which allows determining both the probability of and the time interval remaining before an incoming disruption, with adaptive, from scratch, real time compatible techniques. The results indicate that physics based prediction and control tools can be developed, to deploy realistic strategies of disruption avoidance and prevention, meeting the requirements of the next generation of devices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika

area","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The reliability aspects of the operation of radio navigation systems constitute a crucial element for the safety of maritime navigation.. Technological progress in ship traffic monitoring is achieved through the design of ship systems and shore infrastructure equipped with Automatic Identification System (AIS) devices. One of the issues with AIS operation is the limited availability of the service in the form of data streams with an extended data age recorded on the receiving side. Another problem is the emission and reception by ships of incomplete positional reports without navigational parameters. Such situations render the system operationally unfit in terms of processed information. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the operational characteristics of radio navigation systems and develop tools to monitor the AIS service status on the receiving side. This article presents the development of a model for the availability of an AIS for vessels based on the determined mean time of the occurrence of incomplete navigation parameter values in AIS messages and the results of research in the domain of time and frequency using a mathematical method of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The study results refer to six basic navigation parameters and show a varying service availability factor for the navigation parameters under study, i.e. the latitude (LAT), longitude (LON), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading (HDT), and the rate of turn (ROT). The data recorded by three receiving AIS stations on the Polish coast, i.e. PLKOL, PLSZZ, and PLSWI, were used as a key source of practical knowledge on the limitations of the AIS service availability. The experiment observed interruptions in the regular transmission of data from navigation equipment in the AIS service operational zone. As a result, the functional relationship was described based on the spectral analysis of the frequency of occurrence of times between the service repair (Time To Repair, TTR), and the model was proposed to be applied to the study of other variables. The presented model is a tool that allows for improving the monitoring of vessel traffic in terms of reliability, which directly affects the improvement of maritime traffic safety."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7b03"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"70","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"159-180","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709220878c28a0473903c8","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b03"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479c48","mniswId":"21035","title":"Archives of Transport","doi":"","issn":"0866-9546","eissn":"2300-8830","documentHash":"63c104a5-52dc-41a7-91ff-a1f5e5250136"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"666eea064097073a37539813","year":"2024","volume":"70","number":"2","documentHash":"165b4403-9f76-4d45-8c41-68baf71cc4cc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["automatic identification system","reliability theory","fast Fourier transform","spectral analysis","digital signal processing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060749612"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6cbe","name":"MAŁGORZATA","lastName":"ŁĄCKA","uuid":"9AF91CA6000332BEED504FB674EE30EC8BC169635DBE698E3B558AE33331BE79AEBE15BDC3485DC8E6BF50BEC31A131B492877221C508A5FCA0307E0C20C619B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5899-4659","documentHash":"dc4801fa-ac8b-4513-83ce-58b0a814cca8"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972b2","name":"JACEK","lastName":"ŁUBCZONEK","uuid":"AD046A6DC6AD0360FA497F1276FACC696152E88FA249762E73BFF66BF8CA4A9675182095BB40C89D06F24BDE076116BE8DB7731D37C556684AEB32294110881D","orcidId":"0000-0002-9400-3426","documentHash":"7ad31af0-22d5-45fa-99ab-9e8a0a1513e5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"65e723a34097077658223e82","doi":"10.3390/s24010175","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/1/175/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Methodology for Creating a Digital Bathymetric Model Using Neural Networks for Combined Hydroacoustic and Photogrammetric Data in Shallow Water Areas","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study uses a neural network to propose a methodology for creating digital bathymetric models for shallow water areas that are partially covered by a mix of hydroacoustic and photogrammetric data. A key challenge of this approach is the preparation of the training dataset from such data. Focusing on cases in which the training dataset covers only part of the measured depths, the approach employs generalized linear regression for data optimization followed by multilayer perceptron neural networks for bathymetric model creation. The research assessed the impact of data reduction, outlier elimination, and regression surface-based filtering on neural network learning. The average values of the root mean square (RMS) error were successively obtained for the studied nearshore, middle, and deep water areas, which were 0.12 m, 0.03 m, and 0.06 m, respectively; moreover, the values of the mean absolute error (MAE) were 0.11 m, 0.02 m, and 0.04 m, respectively. Following detailed quantitative and qualitative error analyses, the results indicate variable accuracy across different study areas. Nonetheless, the methodology demonstrated effectiveness in depth calculations for water bodies, although it faces challenges with respect to accuracy, especially in preserving nearshore values in shallow areas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6cbe","5e709285878c28a0473972b2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"175","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6cbe","5e709285878c28a0473972b2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"SENSORS","issn":"1424-8220","documentHash":"c8a0faed-8ad8-4c36-9597-a6dc2ad66c22"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65964ffd4097076c14951263","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"24","number":"1","documentHash":"389da976-4e5f-4930-8d64-2c00a3b8cc43"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["data fusion","data reduction","regression","unmanned surface vessel (USV)","unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","digital bathymetric model","big data processing","MLP neural network","shallow water area"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060781676"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a47b","name":"TADEUSZ","lastName":"GRACZYK","uuid":"2993F5A543105E95FCD7F3A10302DBB27325C0434E993A8A3A9D6C32E6CFFAF240B095132F72417AE6BE63329CE1C5D1CBDC883C318D02273EF3A62CA021FD7F","orcidId":"0000-0001-7136-0773","documentHash":"bd6cb8c1-9d11-4f3d-80fb-7a5642664a5d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-04-22","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":12,"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64afc0704097077ac5bff750","doi":"10.2478/phr-2022-0004","publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/phr-2022-0004","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Underwater vehicles in the research work of Szczecin Universities – systems and applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents the scope of research and application work on unmanned remotely operated deep-sea vehicle systems carried out at the then Szczecin University of Technology (now the West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin).

This phenomenon resulted in accumulation before and erosion below the barrage; a similar problem can be expected due to the planned construction of the Lower Vistula Cascade. This study is dedicated to finding an effective and feasible solution to sediment transport management, acceptable to a wide group of users (e.g., navigation, energy producers, and ecologists). A numerical 1D model was applied to carry out analysis of hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the river section from Włocławek Barrage to the Vistula River mouth in the Baltic Sea. For calibration, historical data describing the accumulation and erosion created by the Włocławek Barrage were used. The proposed model allowed incorporation of new barrages chronologically, in accordance with the proposed time schedules. Analysis was carried out in a 50-year horizon, using a set of historical flow data. For sediment flushing, it was proposed to use natural flooding events exceeding Q10% discharge and to control sediment management of the adjacent barrages.

Overcoming these challenges and embracing new technological trends could enable AI and IoT to play a pivotal role in strengthening environmental sustainability and resilience."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f902","uid":"bk_n03ydqnhCQzeW0cj586g","uuid":"dae78b8a-6bdd-4a4c-aeba-e3409b15c413","name":"Instytut Nauk o Morzu i Środowisku","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b52b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a04739727e","6268aaaa7523406b88cecdd6","602f697d9543c7410626f451"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"696","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b52b","6268aaaa7523406b88cecdd6","602f697d9543c7410626f451","67fe3628fdbe837d2148f19f","675f9eb8ece39855f73cb2fe","67fe3628fdbe837d2148f1a0","5e709284878c28a04739727e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bfef","mniswId":"5581","title":"Electronics (Switzerland)","eissn":"2079-9292","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"d24835fa-79e8-41ed-9235-04b77a1dc9bd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67b30a28fdbe8362a55eb5ee","year":"2025","publishedYear":2025,"volume":"14","number":"4","documentHash":"cd5733b1-8ccf-44a0-a488-b24d7272ccf9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sustainable Environmental Management","environmental monitoring","Internet of Things (IoT)","Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agents","Real-Time Decision Making","Smart Environmental Systems","water quality","predictive analytics","Climate Data","AI-IoT Integration"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060876344"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63923f6640970764e08950ef","name":"Christian","lastName":"Lis","documentHash":"94148e87-ec8a-4fec-9f93-773ef970b5c4"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397214","name":"DARIUSZ","lastName":"BERNACKI","uuid":"132767A7D328EE499A5688C90906E52A5667C782CEBEF34DCE1BFF50E0E21E48BCD999B3C9B06B4139EB4C6532A42EC23B4739F4887AF8CFC892E585AE7491B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-2633-280X","documentHash":"76ce3c67-fdb6-4f59-94b1-93a366687739"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63923f6640970764e08950ee","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/18/6614","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Investigating the Future Dynamics of Multi-Port Systems: The Case of Poland and the Rhine–Scheldt Delta Region","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The objective of this paper is to investigate the future evolution of port systems considering the development of major and minor ports, inter-port competition, and feasible cargo shifts resulting from improved capacity or congestion faced by ports. The literature review on port system dynamics indicates that the relationships that emerge between major and minor ports located in the range stem from competition and cooperation. However, we argue that there are essential ports that play a predominant role in shaping these relationships, while inter-port relations in the system are based on competition. With the use of transshipment forecasts, existing and emerging interdependencies among major and minor ports in the system, and capacity development and/or changes in the level of capacity utilisation, the ex-ante dynamics of the port system are evaluated. The subject of research is two port systems, namely, the Polish port system and the Rhine–Scheldt Delta port system. We investigate the future dynamics in each port system and find that the evolution pattern has different features if the minor ports improve capacity or challenge the major ports by offering free capacity. This paper contributes to research on the evolution of multi-port formations and provides new insights to the peripheral port challenge phenomenon."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397214"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"6614","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397214","63923f6640970764e08950ef"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6322be824097073402f7af98","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"18","documentHash":"6e0792a6-4346-49b7-ab6f-88ebaf50fe6c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["multi-port system","ex-ante dynamics","interdependencies","peripheral port challenge"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060881675"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397272","name":"ALEKSANDRA","lastName":"ŁAPKO","uuid":"AFE1174BBB371C6ABD9C370F9797DA40368D7E7C34C5CF7FB3DFB719F331E631C4775DC6D3DC5332773B607803D17C71076EBCF7FAFF6B357EC51A2E03727811","orcidId":"0000-0003-0235-6329","documentHash":"0f57227e-e7bb-45d9-998f-f541d49c789a"}],"objectId":"66a8d676fdbe8345dee9c397","publicUri":"https://www.cedewu.pl/Zarzadzanie-portami-jachtowymi-w-aspekcie-zrownowazonej-turystyki-zeglarskiej-p4008","type":"BOOK","typeName":"Książka","year":2024,"title":"Zarządzanie portami jachtowymi w aspekcie zrównoważonej turystyki żeglarskiej","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W książce skoncentrowano się na roli, jaką mogą pełnić decyzje zarządcze podejmowane w portach jachtowych we wspieraniu realizacji założeń zrównoważonej turystyki żeglarskiej.

Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship – MASS) to jednostki, które integrują wiele technologii tzw. inteligentnych statków, w tym autonomiczną nawigację, inteligentną obsługę i nadzór nad procesami w maszynowni, komunikację statek–brzeg / statek–statek oraz zintegrowane testy nowych technologii.W ciągu ostatnich kilku lat kraje takie jak Norwegia, Stany Zjednoczone, Japonia, Korea Południowa i Polska odegrały wiodącą rolę w badaniach i rozwoju morskich autonomicznych statków nawodnych. Badania koncentrują się na rozwijaniu technologii, które umożliwiają pełną autonomię jednostek morskich, co jest wynikiem realizacji zarówno inicjatyw komercyjnych, jak i naukowo-badawczych. Integracja technologii mieszanej rzeczywistości MR (ang. Mixed Reality) w kontekście zdalnych operacji MASS staje się kluczowym elementem umożliwiającym prowadzenie efektywnego nadzoru nad statkami. Technologie te mają potencjał do znaczącej poprawy świadomości sytuacyjnej operatorów zdalnych, co jest niezbędne do bezpiecznego i efektywnego wykonywania zadań nawigacyjnych i manewrowych. Wprowadzenie zaawansowanych systemów sensorycznych, zdolnych w przyszłości do generowania trójwymiarowych modeli geometrycznych w czasie rzeczywistym, umożliwia precyzyjne odwzorowanie rzeczywistej sytuacji nawigacyjno-manewrowej, a to jest kluczowe dla efektywnego zarządzania statkami. Badania przeprowadzone w niniejszej monografii koncentrują się na opracowaniu i zbadaniu użyteczności modelu interfejsu stanowiska bezpośredniej kontroli zdalnej statku, który może być wykorzystany przez operatora w lądowym centrum nadzoru zdalnego. Celem badań symulacyjnych oraz eksperckich (ankietowych) było zidentyfikowanie kluczowych elementów technologicznych i operacyjnych, które wpływają na efektywność i bezpieczeństwo manewrów dużych statków o długości całkowitej powyżej 300 m, wymagających asysty holowniczej podczas manewrów portowych. W ramach badania zastosowano podejście studium przypadku, koncentrując się na manewrach gazowca typu Qflex na akwenie ograniczonym Portu Zewnętrznego w Świnoujściu. W szczególności skupiono się na integracji technologii MR oraz na zaawansowanych systemach zobrazowania w celu zapewnienia operatorowi wysokiego poziomu świadomości sytuacyjnej, podczas podejścia, obrotu i cumowania w terminalu LNG. Przez świadomość sytuacyjną operatora MASS rozumie się postrzeganie elementów w środowisku w określonym czasie i przestrzeni, rozumienie ich znaczenia oraz prognozowanie ich stanu w najbliższej przyszłości."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397233"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397233"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"978-83-64434-60-0","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb778","mniswId":"11300","name":"Akademia Morska w Szczecinie","documentHash":"cd457f72-563e-49a6-9a9b-0d70cbc60ea5"},"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["autonomiczne statki nawodne (MASS)","automatyzacja systemów transportowych","centrum nadzoru zdalnego","model RCWS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060887657"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b80f5","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"ZIEMBA","uuid":"07597E7589FF8BCC5F9541CEF321AE83BDF50473E7E3407F76185C8A2356056119F8C2E9E34E1878FFB8F222A31BEDC0A0CB55A1020B2A2F579627999B4F7518","orcidId":"0000-0002-4414-8547","documentHash":"4411b776-ba63-4b11-9745-fd7adc30135c"},{"objectId":"5e7092a2878c28a0473999cd","name":"MARTA","lastName":"SZAJA","uuid":"52213D5E84D7ABF3154D7520C76E89CDC1BB4F234DCE53429E1F8004B709E7464EE05D904E9EF91823B21803080512AEFF9F09CEEA95D3A1A05CFAC9CBF2B284","orcidId":"0000-0002-4137-9104","documentHash":"7e3e2c6d-5502-4aa5-bfe8-64c6ee165e49"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-02-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"67cee34efdbe83385a7f3a61","doi":"10.3390/su17051966","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/5/1966","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Stochastic Modelling in Multi-Criteria Evaluation of Quality of Life : the Case of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Authorities of self-government units, having autonomy in determining the directions of development of their area, can try to use their potential in an optimal way. The actions taken should consequently lead to the creation of the best possible living conditions for the local community. The aim of this article is to verify the hypothesis that the geographical location of self-government units affects the quality of life (QoL) of their inhabitants. Moreover, attempts were made to answer research questions regarding the counties of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship offering conditions ensuring the highest QoL. For this purpose, on the basis of a previously prepared set of criteria and their expert weights, county rankings were developed using the PROMETHEE method. The results of the expert approach were confronted with the results of the stochastic analysis taking into account the uncertainty of the preference model. Based on the results of this research, it was found that the leading positions in terms of QoL in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship were taken by cities with county rights, i.e., Szczecin, Koszalin, and Swinoujscie. At the forefront of counties with the highest QoL were also counties whose capitals were cities with the largest population in the voivodeship."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709434878c28a0473b80f5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f8f5","uid":"bQmdkdjc2fEVOfEB4Ahn06Q","uuid":"224d312f-19b7-4f25-83ea-6ac59c6c2892","name":"Instytut Zarządzania","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a2878c28a0473999cd"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1966","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709434878c28a0473b80f5","5e7092a2878c28a0473999cd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67bc4619fdbe830b4e7fd62b","year":"2025","publishedYear":2025,"volume":"17","number":"5","documentHash":"bc1bd6d3-130b-46de-8f3d-f5e7076bd616"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["multi-criteria decision-making","PROMETHEE","local community","stochastic modelling","self-government units","local and regional sustainable development","quality of life"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060911253"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebed6d8752340254fc4089d","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Lewiński","uuid":"BD6960DBD18A08169C6E312435B759E880B177C04D9CE35698916C156FBCC82725A93C1070A9E6546B70097E9283F40D3A31A97296811F4FC84589399DEAD6BB","orcidId":"0000-0003-3477-9676","documentHash":"5951570a-cf5e-4760-ba62-3271c1c0e9e5"},{"objectId":"5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"PUSTY","uuid":"1E06ADB012CC7227753C4B7437E57B8DF89D65D18B14F2DA930643F6576BDF6D28B19FDC01F2AA9BF88CDB530D45C72637001F7F7377C95D9F1DE524F139965D","orcidId":"0000-0003-1324-5384","documentHash":"54a1c02d-cf53-400f-af14-426d901830c5"},{"objectId":"5e7093e8878c28a0473b3185","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Pilich","uuid":"9E77411DE897E7CC15EE5922C3EAA3F503B423F5C594522B53CC9420D43C2EA76005CCE89281EED23105BC2FD51CA9B052C9EF085ABC2F9E3D6FB0074E971A6C","documentHash":"aa2bc3c1-e90d-49f6-8aa2-1f29863b88e4"},{"objectId":"5e7093e8878c28a0473b315b","name":"Marcin","lastName":"MIETEŃ","uuid":"94BDE4B04CC18DDBD81D6E3A26BD4E5CCE018B9163CB2D15BD9E6C5FED653B058B9D6BC85BE46F0C7560ABCF7416445E1D1F337D2F9F0B3E93C3E7865235A6EB","orcidId":"0000-0003-0290-4073","documentHash":"2e0aea8c-6a7a-465f-a7f9-f9195667ff09"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8eb5","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"KUPICZ","uuid":"4BE48198DC3DF6A77CD8155880F9AB958AE267BFE3A0AE629A0447BEABAD4C1046570F3A642D7E0A433371ED5C9225A5DCF4A23FEB6AC0A4959C95498E722322","orcidId":"0000-0001-8155-7107","documentHash":"1ca34632-3631-4292-ab41-9dd672c8e4d7"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f","name":"JAROMIR","lastName":"MYSŁOWSKI","uuid":"8ABC36B4EFDB49B6F02207FDB71D428632BF913305051EB0AB5211D4E0E0B01ECD75C85CAE5C5C4E966C716F6F381C79E06CA0922404FDDB79F4A1FCDA90B6D9","orcidId":"0000-0002-5464-7622","documentHash":"c5370dca-4288-4a36-a4cd-21f6188b816c"},{"objectId":"5e70925b878c28a0473944fb","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"SIMIŃSKI","uuid":"56824A194640CBFCE7156A17EE9659B8EE0999CA8134D03F682A69DBA9C8A35DF7979750099F4FC6518EDBC8E52DE62C2021EEC182C55322D65DD62974971508","orcidId":"0000-0002-2323-3152","documentHash":"2736022b-0355-413e-9c80-fd2e6c3592cb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6793514cfdbe835f61f332af","doi":"10.61089/aot2024.xdtvm095","publicUri":"https://www.archivesoftransport.com/index.php/aot/article/download/652/568","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Research on the possibility of carrying out convoy driving missions using vehicles with varying degrees of autonomy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The objective of this work is to assess the possibility of driving unmanned vehicles in a convoy, depending on the vehicle type (wheeled or tracked, level 0, according to SAE J3016), and the mutual coincidence with a human-con-trolled vehicle in accordance with the driving scenario adopted. The assessment is based on tests carried out while driving the vehicles along a designated route and measuring the physical quantities that describe the vehicles’ motion, such as the components of the velocity vectors and distances between the vehicles. The tests were carried out on a safe training ground, using inertial-satellite devices mounted on the vehicles; they provide a good basis for planning the minimum passage corridor for a column of vehicles. During the tests, the expected distances between the vehicles were recorded and analyzed depending on the above-mentioned types of the vehicles; based on that, the possibility of using the technology in the carrying out of various missions for the needs of the tactical level units of the Polish Armed Forces was preliminarily assessed. The required lane width for the safe passage of Target 1, Hunter and Target 2 vehicles along the designated routes was calculated, taking into account the external dimensions of the vehicles, the additional widths associated with the vehicles' yaw angles and the maximum lateral distances between the vehicles. During tests of a convoy of remote-controlled vehicles, maintaining a speed of 1.5 m/s and a distance of 10 m, the requirements for the lane width for safe passage were analyzed. The largest lateral gaps were observed between Target 2 and Hunter vehicles, which may affect the planning of the convoy route. The differences in lane width between the two tests were due to the yaw angles of the vehicles and their different dimensions and drive types. In the first test, the lane width for Target 1 and Hunter was 5.50 m and for Target 2 3.70 m; in the second test it was reduced to 3.73 m and increased to 3.75 m, respectively."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df04","uid":"bTekJS7sOItLzJ3Tu1sRSog","uuid":"163ff4e6-d377-4559-accd-7672d40726db","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Techniki Pancernej i Samochodowej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709368878c28a0473a8eb5","5e7093e8878c28a0473b3185","5e7093e8878c28a0473b315b","5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","5e70925b878c28a0473944fb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df04","parentUuid":"163ff4e6-d377-4559-accd-7672d40726db","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df04","rootUuid":"163ff4e6-d377-4559-accd-7672d40726db","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"72","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"7-21","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","5e7093e8878c28a0473b315b","5e7093e8878c28a0473b3185","5e70925b878c28a0473944fb","5e709368878c28a0473a8eb5","5ebed6d8752340254fc4089d","5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479c48","mniswId":"21035","title":"Archives of Transport","doi":"","issn":"0866-9546","eissn":"2300-8830","documentHash":"63c104a5-52dc-41a7-91ff-a1f5e5250136"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678e2e32fdbe8352f865f1f4","year":"2024","volume":"72","number":"4","documentHash":"a29a73c2-f789-44ba-aaae-5df8750e4c63"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["autonomous vehicles","unmanned ground vehicles","wheeled vehicles","platooning"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060913911"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b80f5","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"ZIEMBA","uuid":"07597E7589FF8BCC5F9541CEF321AE83BDF50473E7E3407F76185C8A2356056119F8C2E9E34E1878FFB8F222A31BEDC0A0CB55A1020B2A2F579627999B4F7518","orcidId":"0000-0002-4414-8547","documentHash":"4411b776-ba63-4b11-9745-fd7adc30135c"},{"objectId":"5e7092cf878c28a04739d22a","name":"MATEUSZ","lastName":"PIWOWARSKI","uuid":"ECECC186235F04CD13A5AA2432FB7E8F034D961336E9350FA711DB9F206F67BC756E0DAC3162C09269221E868394F18C419181A82138402262941062952FAB1B","orcidId":"0000-0003-2541-1909","documentHash":"857b65be-b0fd-430e-9701-bab155f0a0fd"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a04739284c","name":"JACEK","lastName":"CYPRYJAŃSKI","uuid":"DBADB06444875006BF7C8B75495BA787008E3A9913BC7CE1A1BE11932185658B9CD02314016AC69B464163379F53D9A9628817BB3F35069A56E82CC199535AA4","orcidId":"0000-0003-0303-4073","documentHash":"13a718eb-5572-4674-89e8-59744ee9aea4"}],"objectId":"6799e681fdbe831aedc8718f","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-78465-1_9","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-78465-1_9","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Machine Learning-Based Exploration of Eye-Tracking Data to Predict Offer Selection","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Visualisations of sales offers have a significant impact on their reception.

The impact is especially observed at the implementation stage. Undeniably, properly managed large water reservoirs are the most effective element of active flood protection and significantly reduce the flood wave, thus limiting losses in housing, infrastructure, industry, or agriculture. At the same time, multifunctional reservoirs pursue other goals that are related to reducing shortages and counteracting the effects of drought, water supply, hydropower, or recreation. In the era of rapidly advancing climate and geopolitical changes, their role seems indispensable when it comes to responsible and coordinated water management in Poland. An open question is how to fully use the potential and to what extent it is possible for the system of reservoirs located on different watercourses to work together in the era of the progressive development of the country resulting in significant changes in land use (sealing large catchment areas) in relation to design assumptions. The article presents an analysis of the work of selected water reservoirs located in the basin of the upper Vistula during the floods that took place in the last decade. On the basis of the obtained conclusions, the authors present recommendations on how to effectively manage the network of reservoirs during a flood while minimizing losses of the water retained in them, which should be used to meet other goals of water management."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70930d878c28a0473a1ff8"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"4025","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70930d878c28a0473a1ff8","5e709285878c28a0473972c2","6800d39cfdbe837d2184ab17","6800d39cfdbe837d2184ab18","60c2fd439543c72336543515","6800d39cfdbe837d2184ab1a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a9a","mniswId":"20224","title":"Water (Switzerland)","issn":"2073-4441","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f45dfe6a-c51f-4cba-a665-a984d2f35671"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6398928e40970708596e1011","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"24","documentHash":"abd17639-6598-40a7-903c-fa87b1a53c28"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["water reservoir","drought prevention","water management","economy","flood","retention"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060919721"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a047399ff4","name":"CHRISTIAN","lastName":"LIS","uuid":"297ACAEBA2DD7C18F2710BAB286A1D7F52A10890F9DEDBF3D9E64F2B05CD983C0D9B0A0981DF070915CDADB40C66D924E45708ACA8E58F4D742A003594DA8396","orcidId":"0000-0002-5606-1449","documentHash":"37f12ca2-3727-40ac-91e9-f13946384e4a"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397214","name":"DARIUSZ","lastName":"BERNACKI","uuid":"132767A7D328EE499A5688C90906E52A5667C782CEBEF34DCE1BFF50E0E21E48BCD999B3C9B06B4139EB4C6532A42EC23B4739F4887AF8CFC892E585AE7491B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-2633-280X","documentHash":"76ce3c67-fdb6-4f59-94b1-93a366687739"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63270d5b4097070f02f8cb7e","doi":"10.3390/en15186614","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/18/6614","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Investigating the future dynamics of multi-port systems : the case of Poland and the Rhine-Scheldt Delta region","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The objective of this paper is to investigate the future evolution of port systems considering the development of major and minor ports, inter-port competition, and feasible cargo shifts resulting from improved capacity or congestion faced by ports. The literature review on port system dynamics indicates that the relationships that emerge between major and minor ports located in the range stem from competition and cooperation. However, we argue that there are essential ports that play a predominant role in shaping these relationships, while inter-port relations in the system are based on competition. With the use of transshipment forecasts, existing and emerging interdependencies among major and minor ports in the system, and capacity development and/or changes in the level of capacity utilisation, the ex-ante dynamics of the port system are evaluated. The subject of research is two port systems, namely, the Polish port system and the Rhine–Scheldt Delta port system. We investigate the future dynamics in each port system and find that the evolution pattern has different features if the minor ports improve capacity or challenge the major ports by offering free capacity. This paper contributes to research on the evolution of multi-port formations and provides new insights to the peripheral port challenge phenomenon."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f8f4","uid":"bNN0GYycX9YWv3CcRaz0UnQ","uuid":"1e7441a5-524f-4801-85eb-283cc41dd106","name":"Instytut Ekonomii i Finansów","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a8878c28a047399ff4"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397214"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"6614","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397214","5e7092a8878c28a047399ff4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6322be824097073402f7af98","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"18","documentHash":"6e0792a6-4346-49b7-ab6f-88ebaf50fe6c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ex-ante dynamics","interdependencies","peripheral port challenge","multi-port system"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060930447"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f95","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"DURAJCZYK","uuid":"E069960460C6319E8403982D4068662B060F8989879762AC11418F76C27A9911D3731BF07086ACF540E35DC9BBA23778B4F009B9895F99689ED373F681BAC40F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1447-973X","documentHash":"f105e54e-f6da-45ec-a00c-61864550faaf"},{"objectId":"5e70920d878c28a04738f2cd","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Niedzielski","uuid":"676BD977DDAB564B34E365A17A89ADFCAB1E7D64CC2291014AF20FC7BC1D4F55D354CE9B149322F65A25844D78E7A6B23ADBAF64DBCB4DF8F29E9AD7DEF09DF5","orcidId":"0000-0001-5024-4722","documentHash":"cf4edb72-3615-42f4-9e3e-44098bba3854"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"639252d640970764e08a5d9e","doi":"10.35808/ersj/2969","publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/2969","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"River Information Services (RIS) as a tool to improve Poland’s position in the European logistic system","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: The aim of the article is to indicate that modern inland navigation using the RIS system can contribute to the improvement of Poland's logistic attractiveness measured on the basis of the LPI logistics performance index.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The following methods were used in the study: literature analysis, descriptive statistics and taxonomic analysis. Findings: Investments in inland waterways and river information systems RIS can further improve this assessment. IWT is the missing mode, which would supplement the infrastructure deficits, especially in metropolitan areas where no further expansion of roads or railways is possible due to the lack of land (e.g. in the Tricity agglomeration).

There has been a heightened curiosity in employing sustainability indicators for gauging the impacts of developmental projects. Even though the literature is abundant on sustainability assessment methods, there is no proper one for the assessment of urban infrastructure projects in the context of Gulf states. Thus, our research intends to fill in this research gap and recommend an incorporated, hierarchically coordinated approach of sustainability indicators to be employed for the sustainability assessment of urban infrastructure development projects. This aim is achieved through a questionnaire survey, by identifying the sustainability indicators related to the infrastructure projects for the cities, in the context of Gulf states. The survey uses the criteria; “Important”, “Practicality”, “Reliability”, and “Relevance” to assess those indicators. Based on expert opinions, the weights of the indicators are approximated through the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. Thus, the study proposes an innovative hierarchically defined structure of sustainability indicators fitting for the Gulf context. Further, it informs urban planners and policymakers, particularly in the Gulf states, about the shift in the direction of sustainability of urban infrastructure systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f8f5","uid":"bQmdkdjc2fEVOfEB4Ahn06Q","uuid":"224d312f-19b7-4f25-83ea-6ac59c6c2892","name":"Instytut Zarządzania","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a8878c28a04739a022"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a04739734f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"14717","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6808c29afdbe8359b382b72e","5e7092a8878c28a04739a022","5e709285878c28a04739734f","6808c29afdbe8359b382b72f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6373458d4097077852ce35a1","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"14","number":"22","documentHash":"4256fe92-0ed7-4472-a6be-e5bce902d7de"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Gulf states","sustainable assessment","AHP","sustainability criteria","urban infrastructure","sustainability indicators"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060930957"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397247","name":"LUCJAN","lastName":"GUCMA","uuid":"183EEB887094163A7D1DA32C6E1C9A50264C298AE5709B7EE006E0C53D5868B52A9B6808B26A98EF6B1D33C54FCD5C3431C76106942EAED5CF09441BFD7961ED","orcidId":"0000-0001-9706-3363","documentHash":"45e41b90-2c7b-43a2-81e2-283764211aeb"}],"objectId":"66a8d8bafdbe8345dee9cc23","publicUri":"https://wydawnictwo.pm.szczecin.pl/ksiazki/monografie/459-risk-management-in-the-area-of-bridges-situated-on-waterways-in-respect-to-ship-collisions","type":"BOOK","typeName":"Książka","year":2024,"title":"Risk management in the area of bridges situated on waterways in respect to ship collisions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The book in this shape shows the current knowledge about ship-bridge collisions.

This publication presents a study to identify trees that may fall on highways. The study used free measurement data from airborne laser scanning and wind speed and direction data from the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management in Poland. Two methods were used to determine the crown tops of trees: PyCrown and OPALS. The effect of wind direction on potential hazards was then analyzed. The OPALS method showed the best performance in terms of detecting trees, with an accuracy of 74%. The analysis showed that the most common winds clustered between 260° and 290°. Potential threats, i.e., trees that could fall on the road, were selected. As a result of the analysis, OPALS detected between 140 and 577 trees, depending on the chosen strategy. The presented research shows that combining ALS technology with advanced algorithms and wind data can be an effective tool for identifying potential hazards associated with falling trees on highways."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1e4","uid":"bkbp2VYA4xopaIA4HrQlzTQ","uuid":"21621076-b7f2-4bc3-a5a5-e684c8630041","name":"Wydział Inżynierii Lądowej i Geodezji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709438878c28a0473b85d8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a984"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d8878c28a04739dfd1","5e709297878c28a04739897e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e088","uid":"bUmj6ITUzeAJhYNJMxX1S8w","uuid":"110407bb-e91f-453a-9532-fed2f55572bc","name":"Wydział Leśny","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70930a878c28a0473a199b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"4479","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d8878c28a04739dfd1","6661a0be409707458fb7ca32","5e709297878c28a04739897e","5e7092ae878c28a04739a984","5e70930a878c28a0473a199b","5e709438878c28a0473b85d8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"976d1e86-5dd0-4e19-9276-7114f4dea573"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"665435724097070e71c69130","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"14","number":"11","documentHash":"64f0b3a8-c34f-4426-828b-c39514537402"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["LiDAR","DTM","DSM","airborne laser scanning","single tree detection","wind model"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060956529"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6800d39ffdbe837d2184abe1","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kolerski","documentHash":"2ccc576f-4cfd-4ec8-9957-398fef332bcd"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1ff8","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wrzosek","uuid":"4F26D22E9D7C346B954AA79F0FDB4503B9FB9B611C39231E05C7D7D6662D019BF8676BAA8C950CC6381028FB7F9B75204A951DF208086CB6812E81452A48E0C2","orcidId":"0000-0002-7908-0896","documentHash":"8dade038-8eb9-4691-a176-ebf86d547e14"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c2","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"WOŚ","uuid":"8DB525EB337A2BF09D4164DB53A82B5A57A966F4B40663B35C3083450E21DA23D82BFE1140B3E49ECF95F9CF714F5F9EE26BAF645439932358559578A9A919CC","orcidId":"0000-0002-1347-6863","documentHash":"c417b6ac-bf58-4fb0-8fff-6587b92dd296"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62dfd1024097073fe3061676","doi":"10.3390/en15051711","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/5/1711","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Energy Potential of the Lower Vistula River in the Context of the Adaptation of Polish Inland Waterways to the Standards of Routes of International Importance","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Based on new policies of the European Union, green technologies are to be mostly considered for power generation.

Fusion of data from these two sensors can provide wider and more accurate information about shore features, utilizing the synergy effect and combining the advantages of both systems. Fusion is used in autonomous cars and robots, despite many challenges related to spatiotemporal alignment or sensor calibration. Measurements from various sensors with different timestamps have to be aligned, and the measurement systems need to be calibrated to avoid errors related to offsets. When using data from unstable, moving platforms, such as surface vehicles, it is more difficult to match sensors in time and space, and thus, data acquired from different devices will be subject to some misalignment. In this article, we try to overcome these problems by proposing the use of a point matching algorithm for coordinate transformation for data from both systems. The essence of the paper is to verify algorithms based on selected basic neural networks, namely the multilayer perceptron (MLP), the radial basis function network (RBF), and the general regression neural network (GRNN) for the alignment process. They are tested with real recorded data from the USV and verified against numerical methods commonly used for coordinate transformation. The results show that the proposed approach can be an effective solution as an alternative to numerical calculations, due to process improvement. The image data can provide information for identifying characteristic objects, and the obtained accuracies for platform dynamics in the water environment are satisfactory (root mean square error—RMSE—smaller than 1 m in many cases). The networks provided outstanding results for the training set; however, they did not perform as well as expected, in terms of the generalization capability of the model. This leads to the conclusion that processing algorithms cannot overcome the limitations of matching point accuracy. Further research will extend the approach to include information on the position and direction of the vessel."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w

polycondensation combining different ratios of FDCA and suberic acid with 1,3-propanediol. The prepared copolymers were characterized from the molecular point of view and processed into free-standing thin films. Afterward, the films were subjected to structural and thermal characterization. The mechanical response and barrier properties to O2 and CO2 were evaluated. PALS measurements were also performed to estimate free volume fraction in the samples. Then composting experiments at lab scale were carried out. The results indicated that the tuning of aliphatic co-unit content is an effective tool to modulate the chain mobility and, in turn, the kind and fraction of ordered phases developed in the samples. In addition to the usual amor\u0002phous and 3D crystalline phase, a further phase, characterized by a lower degree of order than the crystalline one, is present, whose amount is strictly related to copolymer composition. The relative fraction of all these phases is responsible for the different mechanical and barrier performances and biodegradation kinetics. Last but not least, a comparison between the copolymers under study and poly(trimethylene furanoate/sebacate) copo\u0002lyesters previously investigated by the Authors was carried out."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a558","5e709302878c28a0473a107b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093da878c28a0473b1f86"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"223","pagesFromTo":"113673","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093da878c28a0473b1f86","681c8951fdbe83139271c64b","681c8951fdbe83139271c64c","681c8951fdbe83139271c64d","681c8951fdbe83139271c64e","681c8951fdbe83139271c64f","5e709302878c28a0473a107b","681c8951fdbe83139271c651","5e7092ab878c28a04739a558"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c1c","mniswId":"6320","title":"European Polymer Journal","issn":"0014-3057","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"efda0e03-fe16-49cf-ae98-7395f9c1133e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6776775bfdbe831a38b95ba3","year":"2025","publishedYear":2025,"volume":"223","documentHash":"a1c989fa-ee25-4a7b-b9b7-01cf74120f72"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Thermal properties","Gas barrier properties","Composting","2,5-furandicarboxylic acid","Suberic acid","Mechanical properties","Free volume","Random copolymers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061011958"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"681c8ae8fdbe83139274000f","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Niekurzak","documentHash":"7ffd9bb4-70f3-45ca-94e3-cb50d8a38d3a"},{"objectId":"5e7092d5878c28a04739dace","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Lewicki","uuid":"6D042CA4F4C805CD1C756915DC3C75D87DD96796B92558765F34F6CABA36B2D9187AD5C16387FCB6B0EAD9FC31952BFDDA0641C4005A24326FADE8B130F50550","orcidId":"0000-0002-8959-8410","documentHash":"0eedbdde-8954-4194-95a8-dfbcd1c99d28"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f","name":"JAROMIR","lastName":"MYSŁOWSKI","uuid":"8ABC36B4EFDB49B6F02207FDB71D428632BF913305051EB0AB5211D4E0E0B01ECD75C85CAE5C5C4E966C716F6F381C79E06CA0922404FDDB79F4A1FCDA90B6D9","orcidId":"0000-0002-5464-7622","documentHash":"c5370dca-4288-4a36-a4cd-21f6188b816c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2025-03-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67e3dfd1fdbe832ee3725dea","doi":"10.34659/eis.2025.92.1.789","publicUri":"https://ekonomiaisrodowisko.pl/journal/article/view/789","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Assessment of the possibilities of using alternative fuels in the cement industry","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article aims to assess the possibility of using alternative fuels in the cement industry.

The methodology includes the analysis of produc-tion data and the calculation of savings resulting from the use of alternative fuels. On this basis, ecological aspects were also indicated that should be taken into account when analysing the profitability of the investment. The conclusions show that by using alternative fuels, CO2 emissions and production costs are reduced, while there is no negative impact on efficiency and production volume. For practice, it was important to confirm that alternative fuels can also find practical application in the cement industry, and investing in renewable energy sources by cement production plants fits into the goals and directions of development related to sustainable management of resources according to the win-win principle."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d5878c28a04739dace"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"92","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["681c8ae8fdbe83139274000f","5e7092ab878c28a04739a53f","5e7092d5878c28a04739dace"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479dd9","mniswId":"5526","title":"Economics and Environment","issn":"0867-8898","eissn":"2300-6420","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"05c13c8d-7906-49c1-ac5d-d7b086d9030c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67e2a2c4fdbe834633ed458f","year":"2025","volume":"92","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"954b33da-4432-4d00-a150-8c0783296882"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cement industry","economic dimension","alternative fuels","environmental protection"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061014609"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e052497d","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"BROŻEK","uuid":"4635B57887278636145F7244DEB98B68F0D8FE6C5ADE495765BC130C7E90C26B200477CB06A9DD3CC11530816F9279B27C62568C179399FA5C4326B6AF52A668","orcidId":"0000-0002-5022-6492","documentHash":"520540ee-1ccc-4ca7-8403-81909f61e278"},{"objectId":"5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"PUSTY","uuid":"1E06ADB012CC7227753C4B7437E57B8DF89D65D18B14F2DA930643F6576BDF6D28B19FDC01F2AA9BF88CDB530D45C72637001F7F7377C95D9F1DE524F139965D","orcidId":"0000-0003-1324-5384","documentHash":"54a1c02d-cf53-400f-af14-426d901830c5"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a510","name":"Robert","lastName":"Pełech","uuid":"CC887FBC424B33C6EA4363E346AC931C730B909BC1CB584D69189DB848E5E868AF4B2BB609F0E9DDEE7E1B597BBB0E2D97A0344BBA539E417375FDAE203FB26A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8461-7707","documentHash":"6715302f-fcd9-4409-8876-2b392d32653a"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a047398778","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"WIECZOREK","uuid":"BEE3F82E741342D22FC9EF6A928C2354CF675F6FF689ABEF6E21BF76AA6DCE5163326499C11BEAB43271AC69A37C14E3955FDEBB6BF23CA4602828ABBFF91636","orcidId":"0000-0002-2333-7592","documentHash":"3876ef94-fe7b-4047-929c-11a08881b56c"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-02-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"67bf043dfdbe8332277f7946","doi":"10.3390/en18051057","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/18/5/1057","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"The Properties of Diesel Blends with Tire Pyrolysis Oil and Their Wear-Related Parameters","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This research presents the impact of diesel blends with tire pyrolysis oil (TPO) as an additive for minimizing the wear and tear of engine components. This study investigates the blends of normative diesel oil with TPO content ranging from 5% m/m to 20% m/m. Reference measurements are made for pure diesel oil (D100) and pure TPO. This investigation included an evaluation of the corrosion effect and the effect of the fuels tested on abrasive wear. For each fuel, the sulfur content, water content, lubricity (which is defined as the corrected average diameter of the wear trace during the high-frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR) test), and impurity content are determined. Impurities are assessed using indicators such as ash residue, coking residue from 10% distillation residue, determination of wear metals and contaminants, insoluble impurity content, and total sediment by hot filtration. All parameters are determined using recognized methods described in international standards. Approximation models are built for all the analyzed parameters, which can be used in future studies. At the same time, the individual values of the analyzed factors are compared with the threshold values specified in selected standards and regulations. Consequently, it is possible to assess the usefulness of individual fuels in terms of meeting the requirements for minimum wear of engine components. The results show the suitability of pyrolysis oil and the potential for its use as an additive to fossil fuels in terms of meeting most factors. Some of the fuels tested did not meet the standards for acceptable sulfur content. However, in terms of sulfur content, all of the analyzed fuels can be used to power watercraft and land-based power and thermal power plants equipped with flue gas desulphurization systems. A second indicator for not meeting the standards is the ash residue value, which indicates the high content of non-combustible, mainly metallic, substances in the pyrolysis oil used for the tests. Post-recycled oils must, therefore, undergo appropriate purification before being used as an additive to diesel fuels for internal combustion engines. Once the post-recycling oil has been subjected to desulfurization and advanced filtration, it can be used as a fuel additive for land vehicles, which fits in with closed-loop economies and sustainable development strategies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a510"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c8","6164f32875234017e052497d","5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","5e709284878c28a047397245","5e709295878c28a047398778"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1057","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245","5e709285878c28a0473972c8","5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","6164f32875234017e052497d","5e7092ab878c28a04739a510","5e709295878c28a047398778"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67bdade2fdbe830b4eaca90b","year":"2025","publishedYear":2025,"volume":"18","number":"5","documentHash":"06682450-8603-4655-b71c-2aab7143d08c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["diesel oil and pyrolytic oil fuel blends","corrosion","lubricity","engine wear","carbon residue","ash","sulfur","total sediment","tire fuel","contamination"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061014634"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e052497d","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"BROŻEK","uuid":"4635B57887278636145F7244DEB98B68F0D8FE6C5ADE495765BC130C7E90C26B200477CB06A9DD3CC11530816F9279B27C62568C179399FA5C4326B6AF52A668","orcidId":"0000-0002-5022-6492","documentHash":"520540ee-1ccc-4ca7-8403-81909f61e278"},{"objectId":"5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"PUSTY","uuid":"1E06ADB012CC7227753C4B7437E57B8DF89D65D18B14F2DA930643F6576BDF6D28B19FDC01F2AA9BF88CDB530D45C72637001F7F7377C95D9F1DE524F139965D","orcidId":"0000-0003-1324-5384","documentHash":"54a1c02d-cf53-400f-af14-426d901830c5"},{"objectId":"5e709473878c28a0473bd567","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"BOROWSKI","uuid":"1269EABB7BA7BDAF13BCBF40F902C1E32AE48946DFF92CB78C71971B657AB1913DCD5BBBAB0737459AD0E0BC7A0A9BFB9818CA187CCCE54EB1AA54140B7B06E0","orcidId":"0000-0002-4122-3222","documentHash":"32113a2f-bd55-440c-9d22-a3de4b8f17ea"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a510","name":"Robert","lastName":"Pełech","uuid":"CC887FBC424B33C6EA4363E346AC931C730B909BC1CB584D69189DB848E5E868AF4B2BB609F0E9DDEE7E1B597BBB0E2D97A0344BBA539E417375FDAE203FB26A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8461-7707","documentHash":"6715302f-fcd9-4409-8876-2b392d32653a"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-02-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"67af3753fdbe8332768e06b5","doi":"10.3390/en18040860","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/18/4/860","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Evaluation of the Ignition Properties of Fuels Based on Oil Diesel Fuel with the Addition of Pyrolytic Oil from Tires","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The results of testing the ignition properties of fuels in the form of blends of diesel oil with pyrolysis oil produced from tires, used as an additive at concentrations of 0, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20% m/m, are presented in this paper.

The obtained results show the suitability of pyrolysis oil and the possibility of its use as an additive to fossil fuels, which fits in with the requirements of the policies currently being developed for reducing the use of fossil fuels and building a circular economy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a510"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c8","6164f32875234017e052497d","5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","5e709284878c28a047397245","5e709473878c28a0473bd567"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"860","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245","5e709285878c28a0473972c8","6164f32875234017e052497d","5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","5e7092ab878c28a04739a510","5e709473878c28a0473bd567"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ac8246fdbe8304dc015ae2","year":"2025","volume":"18","number":"4","documentHash":"988d4c4b-3875-492e-adbe-9751dbb1eaf8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["flash point","calculated cetane index","distillation curve","pyrolytic oil","recycled oil","cetane number","diesel oil","fuel blends"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061014672"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c311b59543c72336543bd0","name":"RYSZARD","lastName":"ZIĘTEK","uuid":"220FBBA51E86B6F9EF571D5F840F4D3A877FAFD51D0060D485B52445E8B895EFCC824926BA0D23605A332A208C8746B8E67BE5D6D70044CDFC66859D7B95D01D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7034-7251","documentHash":"64bbf706-a862-4116-95a7-91274cbdc95a"},{"objectId":"5e7093da878c28a0473b1f86","name":"AGATA","lastName":"ZUBKIEWICZ","uuid":"DB598AEB9FC51A302817D213C05CDF3FFFE8992ECDF1416B78E0682AD67CC76DCCF48AA4678F31F183FE933AB18F2C701885219FDF2F7A4B31847CEC5A786AAF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6759-0250","documentHash":"06bd3548-175e-4f14-bce4-852709f7a333"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9c9a","name":"KAROL","lastName":"MIĄDLICKI","uuid":"311FC0D420F61E8107BED06BA2568C9F12E14AF545855713906EAF0F4F552D81BF3C0053C3E766B071A8435C421CBE4F7E1A502F16A0A4F080BA8CB230A797BE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6456-3724","documentHash":"97c1752c-891b-4d16-bfe8-a8a33c88add6"},{"objectId":"5e709303878c28a0473a10a1","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"TERELAK-TYMCZYNA","uuid":"62DA75F78D4EE1BF4475FD83FEE2D8DF23B58C42E8687E125FAF0BD4F805F6EE18A14EF4DCE173110D91EC50ECFE7576FDF326426191F047D346458027F3431A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6625-0067","documentHash":"07395adb-55c0-493d-a409-c38de8215d7d"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a4f6","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Marchelek","uuid":"700F7492BB5A998FFD9596EA8D333AF599259949151DA5F3590D974FA9BD98A387EB98C9353701D459D42B0BDF0FD37E133F700CA38DEC38F03971D4880EC153","orcidId":"0000-0002-5231-1850","documentHash":"ea0e4b97-9996-40f2-83d8-57dc23d1520e"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a0473994f0","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"FRANKOWSKI","uuid":"5D8C0899AA6F6CB10454C9AD98C143ED4AAF7229A7F0698EE461B6FA8977EF2E473D3182348D5D79184C6CBC05EE77E98F638FD1F29AF45BADCAC68F13AE9E58","orcidId":"0000-0002-3652-1233","documentHash":"13af6734-a4b1-4467-998a-bc3cdc90b19e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"67a35915fdbe833baf1376f7","doi":"10.3390/ma18010075","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ma18010075","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Energy Efficiency in Turning: A Comparative Analysis of Screw Drive and Linear Drive CNC Machine Tools","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a comparative analysis of the energy efficiency of screw drive and linear drive CNC machine tools in turning operations. Two CNC lathes were investigated, one equipped with screw drives and the other with linear drives, during the turning of specially prepared parts. The research examines active and reactive energy consumption, offering insights into the energy efficiency of different drive technologies. The analysis indicates that lathes with linear drives exhibited a higher reactive power consumption (8 kVar) during idle operation in comparison to those with screw drives (1.2 kVar). However, both drive systems demonstrated comparable potential for reducing reactive power consumption through implementing compensation techniques, with a reduction in reactive power consumption of nearly 70%. For both drive systems, the reduction in power use with compensation was at the level of 23–30% for screw drives and 36–47% for linear drives. The study highlights the importance of considering both active and reactive energy in evaluating the energy efficiency of machine tools. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of energy consumption in turning processes, aiding in the selection and optimization of drive systems for improved sustainability in manufacturing. Future research should explore tool wear impacts, machine-specific energy optimization, and AI-driven solutions for real-time energy management."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709371878c28a0473a9c9a","60c311b59543c72336543bd0","5e709303878c28a0473a10a1","5e7092ab878c28a04739a4f6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929f878c28a0473994f0","5e7093da878c28a0473b1f86","60c311b59543c72336543bd0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"75","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c311b59543c72336543bd0","5e709371878c28a0473a9c9a","5e7093da878c28a0473b1f86","5e70929f878c28a0473994f0","5e709303878c28a0473a10a1","5e7092ab878c28a04739a4f6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6776468dfdbe831a38b7f7da","year":"2025","publishedYear":2025,"volume":"18","number":"1","documentHash":"ba80c887-f1e1-4cbf-aac1-631c072ec594"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["screw drive","turning","energy efficiency","linear drive","reactive power compensation","CNC machine tools"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061014676"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a461","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Grzejda","uuid":"0F20DE9627BC0001DF58D0D33FD85AB9B801240E93720A439C990672C7795D8244DD05E9898758EEB5BEE21AB1001371A6B61C547F6C2AB817B40197F84F9BA5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8323-1335","documentHash":"aec9b320-6a7c-4740-af2a-a9fed4c80d31"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a047397282","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"NOZDRZYKOWSKI","uuid":"A1EBCDD60DF80F7E4BF42F0D714D512D1D7495092AF8B8B466F74A745FA3B90AA864E275266B949A28C1ADB21BC37C0068DC564F19612486BF6EAF57B7C35735","orcidId":"0000-0003-2785-0868","documentHash":"63530bfa-f94e-4127-8fe5-1f36fef2b046"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397223","name":"ZENON","lastName":"GRZĄDZIEL","uuid":"76414D0FF37E0D426374AB68D055AA9A91C83BAABA49808ACE5964542F2BC4EF692447122729D9D6604BBE9DBEF9BFABF9D3749AF168882D55F8DEDECDAC2B87","orcidId":"0000-0001-9348-1111","documentHash":"aa298fdd-deae-4b0c-9cf2-083df0a91fd3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-04-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67e65c8cfdbe8305ab06f47b","doi":"10.12913/22998624/202212","publicUri":"https://www.astrj.com/Determination-of-the-criterion-for-the-use-of-a-toroidal-mandrel-during-the-mechanical,202212,0,2.html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Determination of the criterion for the use of a toroidal mandrel during the mechanical bending of pipes with varying wall thicknesses","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the results of model tests related to the process of forming a pipeline arch by mechanical mandrel bending. The problems that occur during the pipeline manufacturing process and the methods and instrumentation used in forming the bent section of a pipeline, in particular the so-called mandrel bending, are presented. The main part of the paper consists of the results of model tests of stresses and deformations arising from the process of forming the arc of a mechanically bent pipeline using the proposed version of the mandrel with a torus-shaped forming part. These studies included an analysis of the effect of the pre-positioning of the mandrel on the values of deformations and stresses occurring in the cross-section of the bent pipe arch as a function of changes in the wall thickness and external diameter of the pipe and the bending radius. Based on the test results obtained, criteria were established enabling the selected pipe bending method to be used so that the resulting stresses and dimensions in the cross-sections of the bent pipe section are within the limits imposed by the normative recommendations. It was also shown that the criterion determining the efficiency of the bending process is the allowable recommended value of the ovalisation of the pipe cross-section."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a461"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a047397282","5e709284878c28a047397223"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"390-406","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397223","5e709285878c28a047397282","5e7092ab878c28a04739a461"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479bc1","mniswId":"540","title":"Advances in Science and Technology-Research Journal","issn":"2080-4075","eissn":"2299-8624","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"d231421f-b42b-42c2-879b-aa7186856cf8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67e2bd1bfdbe834633ee3138","year":"2025","volume":"19","number":"5","doi":"","documentHash":"90eb33e9-3586-4008-828e-b65689d84baa"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pipelines","mechanical mandrel bending","stress and strain modelling","cross-sectional geometry assessment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061014700"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"681c8b00fdbe831392743bb4","name":"Andrejs","lastName":"Kovalovs","documentHash":"944658de-3792-46c4-aee9-7130e57082c1"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473a9f16","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"FRANCISZCZAK","uuid":"99B15E0E3033A8906EDB41A0F3FD71EF0C7B7BEF04ADEA305715C1A2D4F3DAC62DC59671D6743212A0446434C520EDB1B08C414E8678791C531B581454713F67","orcidId":"0000-0002-4618-7048","documentHash":"f6dc276b-0221-47c5-bcb2-265c2d13edf2"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0fa6","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kwiatkowska","uuid":"BA46BEFF17FB9548A40BE72F14FB632CADBB8B6FCB51F3C854ACAE3B1A1E77CB3501C65AB2F2ACFFDE81625EC6F0663604904695C8476F08E233C8405863FA3B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5002-8242","documentHash":"6ac8a5f2-b389-4b15-a0f8-529da3ed9ccf"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-03-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"67dd58eefdbe8306d0da6432","doi":"10.3390/ma18061239","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/18/6/1239","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Hybrid Polypropylene Biocomposites Reinforced with Short Man-Made Cellulose Fibres and Softwood Flour—Optimisation of Properties Using Response Surface Methodology","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Wood–polymer composites and composites reinforced with natural and man-made cellulose fibres are being extensively used in the automotive and building industries. The main shortcoming of the former is their low-impact resistance and brittleness. The relatively high cost of natural and cellulose fibres is the limitation of the latter. This research uses a hybrid combination of wood flour and short man-made cellulose fibres to develop polypropylene composites for injection moulding that excel in mechanical characteristics and have low material cost. Both reinforcements are of wood origin. The synergistic hybrid effect of this combination of reinforcements helps to achieve their mechanical performance superior to that of wood–polymer composites at preserved low cost. The proposed Response Surface Methodology enables the calculation of necessary weight fractions of two reinforcements to achieve desired mechanical properties like strength, tensile, flexural modulus, and impact resistance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709301878c28a0473a0fa6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709373878c28a0473a9f16"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1239","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709373878c28a0473a9f16","681c8b00fdbe831392743bb4","5e709301878c28a0473a0fa6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67cfe980fdbe8331e3788122","year":"2025","volume":"18","number":"6","documentHash":"a8b89ad7-5ec8-4684-a59d-27f6031921b5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["polypropylene matrix","hybrid effect","wood–plastic composites","man-made cellulose","injection moulding","mechanical properties"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061069370"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e052497d","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"BROŻEK","uuid":"4635B57887278636145F7244DEB98B68F0D8FE6C5ADE495765BC130C7E90C26B200477CB06A9DD3CC11530816F9279B27C62568C179399FA5C4326B6AF52A668","orcidId":"0000-0002-5022-6492","documentHash":"520540ee-1ccc-4ca7-8403-81909f61e278"},{"objectId":"5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"PUSTY","uuid":"1E06ADB012CC7227753C4B7437E57B8DF89D65D18B14F2DA930643F6576BDF6D28B19FDC01F2AA9BF88CDB530D45C72637001F7F7377C95D9F1DE524F139965D","orcidId":"0000-0003-1324-5384","documentHash":"54a1c02d-cf53-400f-af14-426d901830c5"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a510","name":"Robert","lastName":"Pełech","uuid":"CC887FBC424B33C6EA4363E346AC931C730B909BC1CB584D69189DB848E5E868AF4B2BB609F0E9DDEE7E1B597BBB0E2D97A0344BBA539E417375FDAE203FB26A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8461-7707","documentHash":"6715302f-fcd9-4409-8876-2b392d32653a"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c8","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SZCZEPANEK","uuid":"E83B40377F07C1FB8E20EF9FC0B9D90258F2609231DF4EE822D59ABD7C822FD89E22137CF9BC7317F3CE836EEEC75CC16A48D1C40C9743BCF5430C2A2C2B3D2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-9772","documentHash":"45bed031-9432-4902-ace7-1c258c414ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397245","name":"LESZEK","lastName":"CHYBOWSKI","uuid":"E1B572E951DF66686B4FF5FA956229AABE00E6BB5ECB668941BF0F08EDAF2509FEAE02E4AB02CD91A7A60F95317DEDCB36E1E970BF66BB9261CED7227297BEE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0245-3946","documentHash":"d6fad4ea-bb8b-4729-ad39-2763f85387ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-04-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6800b7bbfdbe830a5fbdb77d","doi":"10.3390/en18081993","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/18/8/1993","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Rheological Properties of Diesel-Based Fuels with Tyre Pyrolysis Oil as Admixture","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the article is to present the impact of blending diesel fuel with tire pyrolysis (TPO) oil on the changes in the fuel’s rheological properties and to evaluate these changes in the context of meeting legal requirements for various types of fuels. This research presents the impact of normative D100 diesel oil with TPO as an admixture on the rheological properties of the blends. Measurements are made for the content of TPO in the blend equal to 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20% m/m. In addition, the reference measurements are made for pure diesel oil and pure pyrolytic oil. Kinematic viscosity density, dynamic viscosity, viscosity index, pour point, cloud point, and cold filter plugging point are determined. The density of each sample is found at 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 °C. Viscosity is determined at the reference temperatures of 20, 40, and 100 °C, which are typically used as reference temperatures for petroleum products. Approximating models are built for all the analyzed parameters, which can be used in future studies. The fit of each model to empirical data is evaluated using the coefficient of determination R2. At the same time, the individual values of the analyzed indicators are compared to the limit values specified in selected standards and regulations, thus allowing us to assess the usefulness of individual fuels in terms of compliance with effective and reliable engine operation requirements. The fuels under study fulfill the normative requirements for the parameters for marine distillate fuels for blends with a pyrolysis oil content of 0–20% m/m and the requirements for standard-grade diesel oils indicated in the Regulation of the Minister of Economy of Poland for blends with a pyrolysis oil content of 0–7% m/m."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a510"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c8","6164f32875234017e052497d","5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1993","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245","5e709285878c28a0473972c8","5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","6164f32875234017e052497d","5e7092ab878c28a04739a510"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67f76866fdbe83209ce1cb22","year":"2025","volume":"18","number":"8","documentHash":"6f9d39d5-e920-4913-8669-6de1e508dba8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pyrolytic oil","rheological properties","diesel oil","recycled tire oil","fuel blends"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061069621"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092a2878c28a04739998a","name":"MICHAŁ","lastName":"PLUCIŃSKI","uuid":"390D94B8922347E67D6D858715B455F8B1AE7248B682D22DF422F7E24C2C493281859E7450B188218D02246195DE4946078196EE9763552BE1CB5C75338A25D7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8150-7388","documentHash":"fb707e78-26e1-4447-9e14-506d9b19281f"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972c7","name":"NATALIA","lastName":"WAGNER","uuid":"26E53CDC2FD3099002948F30AA2D35392306E07B07818599B3E7D17A8D7F2EE9ED0B1B30B78FCD2C46741A3A2084611956C050ED59175CB2D0CBFD32C7925C1D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6898-4737","documentHash":"ba5e1d6d-7560-4ad8-9072-54e365477c50"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a047397286","name":"IZABELA","lastName":"KOTOWSKA","uuid":"97120EE3E7615FB6E7FC803C1C5265434430CAB9519F2C5F2A62857B0520E9C251F3E9331A76269F76B5689FFCFF3C053A8A799009CC58E215082E5E166A0F11","orcidId":"0000-0001-8319-8216","documentHash":"d80b888c-f013-4f65-994e-b99210c4a8e0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63925a9440970764e08a9ee6","doi":"10.3390/su14106255","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/10/6255","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The impact of improving the quality of the port’s infrastructure on the shippers’ decisions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Important attributes of a transportation chain are the costs of their operation, the security of supply they provide, and reducing carbon emissions throughout the chain. When making managerial decisions about the chain configuration, shippers consider the optimal choice of means of transport, carriers, or ports. Seaports, as transport nodes, determine the functioning of supply chains they serve. A constant process observed in the world shipping is the consistent increase in the average size of ships. Adapting the port and port access infrastructure to the changes observed in the world shipping is a prerequisite for maintaining the competitive position of the port, and consequently of the entire transport chain. Adequate hydrological conditions ensuring safe access to ports for increasingly larger ships are necessary for the stable functioning and development of a port and the entire region. For shippers, the certainty that the handling of larger vessels is assured regardless of any fluctuating hydro-meteorological conditions and temporary vessel entry permits is a guarantee of security of supply. This study aims to demonstrate the impact of fairway deepening on port-oriented supply chain costs and security of supply, as well as verification of the importance of these factors for cargo shippers’ decision-making. The article used the case study method based on the port of Szczecin, for which the investment of deepening the fairway to 12.5 m is being implemented. The article estimates the transport costs of five transport chains served by the port of Szczecin. Our research showed that a 2.5 m increase in the permissible draught of ships results in a decrease of up to 25% in transport costs resulting mainly from the reduction in specific fuel consumption throughout the chain. The analysis of the results showed that a secondary benefit of deepening the fairway can change the structure of the port’s foreland. This conclusion was validated by means of in-depth interviews held with selected shippers cooperating with the port of Szczecin. An additional outcome of the interviews was identification of the remaining conditions that should be met to take full advantage of improved port accessibility. The research is the first step to broader studies assessing whether improving quality of port infrastructure can contribute to a reduction in emissions from ships in a port and thus facilitate the transition to zero-emission ports."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f8f5","uid":"bQmdkdjc2fEVOfEB4Ahn06Q","uuid":"224d312f-19b7-4f25-83ea-6ac59c6c2892","name":"Instytut Zarządzania","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a2878c28a04739998a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c7","5e709285878c28a047397286"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"6255","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972c7","5e709285878c28a047397286","5e7092a2878c28a04739998a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d9079f40970776cd099fb9","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"10","doi":"","documentHash":"1551a90a-381d-4dbe-a118-e194915e4ab9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["transport costs","seaport","decision making","ship size","port infrastructure","security of supply"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747347496457"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"615c4cd22467f05fd3a9b4bf","name":"J.C.","lastName":"Pereira","documentHash":"2decbd89-8445-4796-8ca9-9e04dc443298"},{"objectId":"615c4cd22467f05fd3a9b4bc","name":"B.","lastName":"Fenert","documentHash":"5fa8a257-e790-47d7-8927-c69ca27cd0f7"},{"objectId":"5e7094ad878c28a0473c1753","name":"Lucyna","lastName":"Lewandowska","uuid":"1DD1E26FA41421C1DD392929D1A8E4C9505550FCC34BDFFE4EE2F9C0E7672F8AE97CCFD0E380B9284C8B34514B171617BEE49B76C3C044284BBA4371590EEBB8","orcidId":"0000-0002-3197-388X","documentHash":"4caf2fa5-3504-405b-8f34-ef2ad933e866"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b81b0","name":"MAGDALENA","lastName":"ŚLĄCZKA-WILK","uuid":"7D9A170983C231B78496ECFA1224BA93BEB60672707487E575D018E1B74CB90D22C6F01FE60FB6981EF92038EA990ABBC6448D42FFC17403F374FD94C6A0677B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5006-4147","documentHash":"f113495d-7193-40aa-a256-e21c6b595f66"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ae7b","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Zarzycki","uuid":"4A5C0A3CB4A60DC48D93E652A31201496EE8F99BA9398180DEEC01F3E94387312DDEC2BB52AC20DFF7A4061C3343B0DF7391E8534EDBC594BB766B9BD336BF5E","orcidId":"0000-0003-4018-9605","documentHash":"73e170aa-a6de-46f5-9a38-004938b0da7d"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ae68","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Piaskowski","uuid":"C44AF9587D2002B0AEE931B0013221B783D2FD9A9B8BA610BE604BE382152372E04819221B81C8C42993A07F69076D650005FB4B9EB6F281BCAA81338EE83924","orcidId":"0000-0001-8440-1562","documentHash":"3bdede9e-cf22-40cd-9a5b-9a2d0bc6b857"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ae56","name":"Renata","lastName":"Świderska-Dąbrowska","uuid":"A6CAA78626CF41A909E073BF2A0D93DC6ECCE11DBB8EB8035146C7B28BCDC0A07442B03441C4AC8CD0FCF3833FDD5D200B28D5CA82980C6CE6BD178B49971BC5","orcidId":"0000-0001-9925-4796","documentHash":"930ebe42-ab49-4a88-88a5-517edd4746fb"}],"objectId":"615c4cd22467f05fd3a9b4b7","doi":"10.1016/b978-0-12-823727-4.00013-4","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128237274000134","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Portable microplanar extraction, separation, and quantification devices for bioanalytical and environmental engineering applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This chapter predominantly focuses on miniaturization problem related to determination of various biomarkers and micropollutants in complex biological and environmental samples.

Tackling such challenges as the constant pursuit of reduction of unit transportation costs and negative effects on the environment has led to the development of very- and ultra-large container ships, which dominate transport on the world’s major shipping routes. Very-large container ships are conventionally assumed to have a cargo capacity above 10,000 TEU and an overall hull length below 369 meters, whilst the unique feature of ultra-large container ships is an overall hull length over 390 meters. The ship operational states and the main electric power receivers such as reefers and bow thrusters are mentioned and formulae to predict their electricity demand are given. Contemporary configurations of ships’ electric power stations are presented and discussed. Cargo capacity expressed in 20-foot equivalent units (TEU) was identified as the main predictor of the electricity generation capacity based on a representative very- and ultra-large container ships database. Using a simple linear regression model based on the least squares method, a formula was developed to predict the electricity generation capacity of very- and ultra-large container ships at the initial design stage. The prediction will find application in the design of very and ultra-large container ships’ electric power stations. The use of the developed formula at the initial design stage enables obtaining results that are sufficiently accurate to the results of the exact verification calculations at the technical design stage."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c3354f9543c723365440f6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"69","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"103-133","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c3354f9543c723365440f6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cd4f","mniswId":"14769","title":"Naše More","doi":"10.17818/nm","issn":"0469-6255","eissn":"1848-6320","documentHash":"9271f1f8-1c5d-4fe6-a9af-21bdddd7d40b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cfefec409707101feab396","year":"2022","volume":"69","number":"2","documentHash":"9bd82db5-605e-4539-b66d-019d12b7af22"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["container ship","VLCS","electricity generation","electric power station","generating set"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654740220"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c3354f9543c723365440f6","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"KORLAK","uuid":"A53088D8FA90F5AA22075FC239FA25D53D60CCFEBB7E31DF90D61C07FED1BAE9592ECCC5BF33EFE110137E5814CF3A1DD5A3B75BC09AC7A4B73001C747443831","orcidId":"0000-0002-4548-4796","documentHash":"46c5817a-623c-4869-b36d-d854866ce1ed"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-03","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6565ab3a4097075e9e4d6778","doi":"10.19206/ce-158545","publicUri":"http://www.combustion-engines.eu/pdf-158545-92449","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Comparative analysis of the heat balance results of the selected Tier III-compliant gas-fuelled two-stroke main engines","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Two-stroke engines are distinguished by the highest overall efficiency among all main engines.

The REE studies in marine pore fluids were limited by analytical challenges. The pore water analysis we applied is based on a modern, improved analytical technique (ICP-MS, Perkin-Elmer SCIEX Elan DRC-e) with a cross-flow nebulizer and a spectrometer optimized (RF, gas flow, lens voltage) using a quadrupole cell in a DRC (Dynamic Reaction Cell) mode that allowed us to define the whole suite of REE. The ƩREY values of the samples vary from 4.05 μg/l to 106.34 μg/l. The REE content is at least one order of magnitude higher than the oceanic water. We followed the natural variations of La, Lu, Ce, and Y in absolute concentrations for station 3607. Cerium and Y are slightly enriched around the water-sediment interface, while La and Lu are enriched in the deeper layers. PAAS normalized REY patterns show a pronounced negative Ce/Ce* ratio together with a little MREE and HREY enrichment. The relatively “flat” REE patterns are typical for the shallow open ocean and characterize REE released from the organic matter degradation. We assume that the decomposition of and adsorption on organic matter and oxidation conditions are the main factors for REE fractionation in the pore water. The reason for some scatter in our REY data might be linked to bioturbation that has affected the sediment profiles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a3fe"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"51","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"27-35","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64afca574097077ac5c08398","64afca574097077ac5c08399","64afca574097077ac5c0839a","64afca574097077ac5c0839b","64afca574097077ac5c0839c","5e7092ab878c28a04739a3fe"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e70f87e46e0fb0001b393ad","title":"GEOLOGICA BALCANICA","issn":"0324-0894","documentHash":"35010a10-196d-436c-8b04-76154c7d64b9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64afca574097077ac5c08397","year":"2022","volume":"51","number":"2","documentHash":"ec4c2b88-1138-4f3e-a2ae-bf64a5d09740"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["rare earth elements","yttrium","pore waters","metalliferous sediments"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654778046"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972d9","name":"DARIUSZ","lastName":"TARNAPOWICZ","uuid":"B2F02446E4E95D09304ED7E7491C0B7D2AE99EB31D6FF1BF764F887969968F5FBF2DC02529ABCC9FF3FEAFF38527EFCA11C2110CDDC46DE85D51FAD2569698E7","orcidId":"0000-0002-9456-2316","documentHash":"9dd63c94-31b7-4b82-a056-3203ea65be2a"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739721c","name":"SERGEI","lastName":"GERMAN-GALKIN","uuid":"5CB13DE91564D2C3D724071B040DBED856B10448CF58C302BE54F33DA41D2C3D59DA23D1FF8186AB5FE70131A348466509E908DD37E0B380874CEA27821EC0D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-9342-7630","documentHash":"d1e715cd-0aad-441b-85db-6353eb124db8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-16","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":2,"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64b65e284097072492b15a82","doi":"10.17818/nm/2023/1.2","publicUri":"https://hrcak.srce.hr/clanak/425911","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Energy Optimization of a Series Hybrid Electric Ship Propulsion System","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The electric ship propulsion system due to its economic advantages and, first of all, better mechanical properties than internal combustion engines (influence on ship manoeuvrability) have gained popularity in recent years. This paper presents an investigation of a series hybrid electric propulsion system where two sources of power are used: a permanent magnet synchronous generator and energy storage battery to supply electric propulsion system, which is a permanent magnet synchronous motor. Controlling the power flow from multiple power sources in a series hybrid mechatronic system is important to increase the energy efficiency of the propulsion system. Developing a suitable power flow control method is difficult due to the nonlinear nature of the power sources in the series system. In this paper a method of energy optimization of the system has been verified which allows to improve energy efficiency by reducing reactive power in the system. In this paper, an analytical study of the mechatronic system of a serial hybrid electric ship propulsion system is carried out based on the analysis of the steady-state electromagnetic and energy relations. The proposed control with energy optimization was compared with the commonly used FOC control. The analytical studies have been confirmed by performing simulation studies in Matlab-Simulink program. The proposed optimization method allows its use not only in ship electric drives but also in other autonomous electric drives using the series topology of the hybrid system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972d9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"70","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a04739721c","5e709285878c28a0473972d9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cd4f","mniswId":"14769","title":"Nase more","issn":"0469-6255","eissn":"1848-6320","documentHash":"129a3794-617e-486f-ab3e-88cc676d9598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64b65e284097072492b15a83","year":"2023","number":"1","documentHash":"ad3bcbe8-e702-4a6f-bd1f-0970747bb7cf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["control of the active converter","energy optimization","series hybrid systems"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654856403"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66618163409707458fb36866","name":"Jaya","lastName":"Shradha Fowdur","documentHash":"ff965d7a-13e3-46dc-9761-18928076b966"},{"objectId":"66618163409707458fb36865","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Banyś","documentHash":"f3284d1e-379f-4d1e-8603-8cae779f9a42"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390892","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"GUCMA","uuid":"0E5FE9A95A7C302D3F64BB5CCA8799076D3E393D98664C3EAF36D518754A484BB8AC514B9232CD32F12FD15A9433401120179A39822C9688C157EBB3A2212DC2","orcidId":"0000-0002-7501-5632","documentHash":"5db43317-7105-4bee-b280-f4edb8ba8062"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66618163409707458fb36863","doi":"10.17818/nm/2024/1.5","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.17818/nm/2024/1.5","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Assessment of Possible Misidentification of AIS Transponders within AIS Data due to Bit Inversions of MMSI","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"For almost two decades now, the automatic identification system (AIS) has contributed to increasing the safety of navigation at sea. In addition to that, the system can provide valuable data for surveillance of maritime traffic on a global scale. For reliable tracking the movement of vessels with AIS, it is important to correctly identify the craft. Nowadays, such identification is based entirely on the maritime mobile service identity (MMSI). Despite extensive research being done on the subject of anomalies detectable within the AIS, with emphasis on spotting and correcting erratic vessel movements, a possibility of accidental falsification of MMSI leading to incorrect track reconstruction of a vessel has so far been neglected. This study focuses on analysing hypothetical situations when the MMSI of an AIS transponder on board a vessel is altered within the transponder software and a valid AIS data message is sent with a false MMSI which accidentally belongs to a completely different vessel. Since such MMSI transformation leaves no traces, an assessment of a speed-based plausibility is additionally proposed to figure out how many MMSI-based injections of false AIS track points can be detected. © 2024, University of Dubronvnik.

During certain stages of these experiments, a simple detection system, including silicon (Si) detectors of varying thicknesses and different aluminum (Al) absorption foils placed in front of the detectors, was employed. In addition  to  Si charged particle detectors, a high-purity germanium detector was used to investigate the effect of internal pair e+/e-creation originating from deuteron–deuteron reactions and to determine the branching ratio between emitted protons, neutrons, and e+/e- pairs at 12 keV deuteron energies. The measured electron energy spectrum and the electron–proton branching ratio agree with Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations and our theoretical expectations for an electron–positron pair creation decay from the deuteron–deuteron 0+ threshold resonance to the ground state. Furthermore, according to theoretical predictions, an increase in the electron–proton branching ratio with decreasing deuteron energies could make the electron channel the most dominant at thermal

speed of water flow - one tarpaulin diffuser and one net confusor of 120 mm mesh, 3) ultracross codend with two tarpaulin diffusers and two net confusors of 120 mm mesh. Validation of these codends selectivity was done by comparison of single trawls using each tested codend results with results of trawls using T90 codend and of trawls using a double (twin) bottom trawl set deployed in various variants of innovative, T90 and herring codends. The results of the study indicate that the use of an ultracross codend with innovative devices reducing the water flow speed (with two tarpaulin diffusers and two 120 mm net confusors) significantly reduces the number of undersized cod (<35 cm) even down to 1.2% in the haul."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972e6","609235a69543c73526c48cea","5e709284878c28a04739725f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473972e6","5e709284878c28a04739725f","609235a69543c73526c48cea"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"67af154dfdbe8332768c8334","title":"International Workshop on Metrology for the Sea","year":2024,"isbn":"979-835037900-6","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10765360/proceeding","translation":false,"documentHash":"0701efcd-9327-440b-9d0e-73c6b7d7b98c","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7fc","mniswId":"26900","name":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","documentHash":"b80f2dd5-e346-440a-b828-4712b50be331"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654965458"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a047397297","name":"JAN","lastName":"MONIETA","uuid":"5126CD6588EC51E96B1493D017947160A0937C6B4EC70C8F68E8206045627308F6C6407B4F63AB006B0B7E5470275189A0785A0CF022D45F1C643E8E323F3BBF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2992-5800","documentHash":"51e85aa9-9cbd-422f-9a89-b61a94515f35"}],"objectId":"67af2009fdbe8332768cd79f","doi":"10.23919/spa59660.2023.10274435","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274435","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Diagnostic development of damage of ship generator sets by means of electrical signals","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents the use of selected signals to diagnose the development of damage to some components of generators driven by marine compression-ignition engines. The research was conducted under the natural operating conditions of vessels, usually during port stops. During the investigation, it was possible to observe apparent changes in the values of diagnostic symptoms, which corresponded to the development of gradual or sudden damage.The developing damages detected in the work were in metal components. Diagnostic signals for detecting developing defects measured the parameters of working and accompanying processes in various domains.The study sought proper signal analysis methods, so computer visualization and recording diagnostic parameters from various fields were used. Decimation, time domain windowing, wavelet statistics, color analysis, and machine learning were used for classification in artificial neural networks. Experimental studies demonstrated the ability to diagnose damage development processes.

Multifunctional, they are used for flood protection, drought prevention and other purposes. Water reservoirs can also play a fundamental role in improving navigability on the lower section of the Vistula River from the Włocławek barrage to the mouth of the Gdansk Bay. Their implementation is a determinant for the possibility of restoring the economic role of the river in question. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to determine the current navigation conditions and the state of the regulatory buildings on the Lower Vistula. The investments necessary to achieve international parameters of the waterway were also determined, together with the calculation of financial benefits related to their implementation. This was possible based on the conducted bathymetric measurements, spatial analyses, economic calculations and queries of the obtained studies. It was established that fairway depths of 1.4 m are ensured for 180 days per year on average. On the other hand, the construction of five barrages (Siarzewo, Solec Kujawski, Chełmno, Grudziądz and Gniew) will make it possible to achieve at least a navigability class IV (international) on the section of the Vistula River waterway. In addition, the barrages will enable the retention of 1.2 billion m3 of water and will be associated with financial benefits such as shipping use, flood protection and counteracting the effects of drought. On this account, annual revenues may amount to approximately PLN 3.5 billion. This shows that the construction of the reservoirs is profitable, and the proposed solutions should be implemented in the context of sustainable water management and adaptation to climate change."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70930d878c28a0473a1ff8"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"4042","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c2fd439543c72336543515","5e709285878c28a0473972c2","5e70930d878c28a0473a1ff8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a9a","mniswId":"20224","title":"Water (Switzerland)","issn":"2073-4441","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f45dfe6a-c51f-4cba-a665-a984d2f35671"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6398928e40970708596e1011","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"24","documentHash":"abd17639-6598-40a7-903c-fa87b1a53c28"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["inland navigation","water management","water retention","retention reservoirs","Vistula","counteracting the effects of drought","economy","inland waterways"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747952392922"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397260","name":"ARTUR","lastName":"KUJAWSKI","uuid":"8E5C2AF9CC9460951AB778606073C28414B5BAD06A2F7D3148A330977BC7A3296962AE2F8101EF94D39C708FC16FBB2AE6189580F1F20FDB2D872EC2AAC5B101","orcidId":"0000-0002-3661-1562","documentHash":"24263fe7-bb38-4d62-ad9b-2b44cb8a352e"}],"objectId":"67af1f2bfdbe8332768cd51c","publicUri":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991053076598405066&context=L&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&lang=pl&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=LibraryCatalog&query=any,contains,978-83-7193-923-5&offset=0","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Możliwości zastosowania widzenia komputerowego opartego na technologii sieci neuronowych w inteligentnych systemach transportowych na przykładzie aglomeracji szczecińskiej","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W rozdziale przedstawiono możliwości wykorzystania metod widzenia komputerowego do analizy sytuacji drogowej wybranych punktów sieci transportowej aglomeracji szczecińskiej, przy użyciu bezzałogowych statków powietrznych.

The results relate to reference conditions in which the engine is fed with pure diesel oil (D100). The experiment included the evaluation of engine performance and the determination of the content of selected substances in the exhaust gas for brake-set engine loads equal to 5 Nm, 10 Nm, 15 Nm, and 20 Nm. For each load, engine operating parameters and emissions of selected exhaust components were recorded at preset speeds in the range of 1400–2400 rpm for each engine load. The hourly fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature were determined. The contents of CO2, CO, and HC in the exhaust gas were measured. The consumption of D90+RF10 increased by 56%, and CO2 emissions were 21.7% higher at low loads. The addition of sulfur-containing pyrolytic oil as an admixture to diesel oil resulted in SOx emissions. The results show the suitability of pyrolytic oil and the possibility of using it as an admixture to fossil fuels. In order to meet SOx emission levels in land-based installations and for vehicle propulsion, it is necessary to desulfurize fuel or desulfurize deSOx exhaust gas systems. The CO and HC emission levels in the exhaust gases from the engine powered by the D90+RF10 fuel meet current requirements for motor vehicle exhaust composition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972c8","6164f32875234017e052497d","5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","5e709284878c28a047397245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af745","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ad"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"2621","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397245","5e709285878c28a0473972c8","5e7093b5878c28a0473af745","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ad","5e709492878c28a0473bfc26","6164f32875234017e052497d","5e7092ab878c28a04739a510"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":"10.3390/en","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"073c6b4f-b994-4710-8065-02d74e1e73ce"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6825c3c5fdbe835ff4324b52","year":"2025","volume":"18","number":"10","documentHash":"7a3cb26c-4de0-4f00-8990-25ffef05b954"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["diesel oil","recycled oil","tire pyrolytic oil","fuel blends","engine performance","CO2 emission","HC emission","hydrocarbons"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039400185"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709302878c28a0473a105b","name":"ROMA","lastName":"STRULAK-WÓJCIKIEWICZ","uuid":"8C92AA1B80A0E1A8B33038D2BFA2853743E2459C2E07660458E502680B6FD312E49940536498018058F202263B6B3C4E56C1CE6422308191A4733D2334E5AC6A","orcidId":"0000-0002-9702-7554","documentHash":"74fdf136-6273-46ff-b941-dd2193ebe09f"}],"objectId":"68303095fdbe8312e619f4d0","publicUri":"https://cor.sgh.waw.pl/handle/20.500.12182/1292","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Koncepcje cyfrowych platform współpracy w różnych obszarach działalności człowieka - trzy studia przypadków","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W rozdziale zaprezentowano trzy studia przypadków dotyczące koncepcji utworzenia cyfrowych platform współpracy w różnych obszarach działalności człowieka.

Often, the diagnosis of the state of this system has a multi-faceted dimension, but always specific social awareness of the quality of its functioning is an expression of the perception of the state's activity in this area. Especially since its basic units (Primary Health Care—(pol. POZ), such as clinics, hospitals or medical, nurse and midwifery practices, could not function properly without an efficient pharmaceutical market. This market can be considered one of the most developed branches of the economy in Poland, but at the same time it is subject to constant changes, both in terms of the ownership structure of entities in this industry, the rules of trading, primarily in medicinal products, and the administrative system of public health care management itself. A special legal and logistical relationship is the “dyatic” connection between the pharmaceutical wholesale market and the pharmacy (retail) market, because the principles of Good Distribution Practice (pol. DPD) are generally applicable in the drug distribution process.\n\nThe main goal of this chapter is to identify and present the characteristics of the basic features and structure of the pharmaceutical market in Poland and the structural and functional key segment of the pharmaceutical supply chain, i.e. the pharmaceutical wholesale and retail pharmacy market. The research process used a methodological approach based primarily on “mixed methods” and “desk research”, but also on creative systematics and synthesis. The most important issues were analyzed based on key secondary data and the main legal regulations were analyzed in the context of specific groups of entities (distribution levels) involved in the distribution process on the pharmaceutical market. This allowed for the presentation of the key characteristics and synthetic analysis in terms of logistics of the following key links in the “dyatic” optics, the main intermediaries on the pharmaceutical market, i.e., wholesalers and pharmacies. The most important factors of cooperation in the pharmaceutical supply chain between these links are: punctuality of deliveries, completeness of deliveries and speed of deliveries. However, trade and logistics relations between pharmaceutical wholesale entities and the retail pharmacy market are multi-faceted in terms of complexity and high logistic requirements, and are subject to strong regulation by authorized external entities, and are also shaped by nationwide health care policy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091f7878c28a04738dce2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"161-182","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091f7878c28a04738dce2"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"68303368fdbe8312e61a35de","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-70292-1","title":"Hospital Supply Chain: Challenges and Opportunities for Improving Healthcare","year":2024,"isbn":"9783031702914","issn":"2662-9461","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-70292-1.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"f75598f5-6739-4c51-b5bd-21f2bba8a164","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pharmaceutical supply chain","future trends in the pharmaceutical","safety","supply chain","structure of the pharmaceutical market in Poland","health distribution"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039401313"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68303a3efdbe8312e61ad520","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Maliński","documentHash":"56117c4d-18d5-47de-9689-1371197fc700"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972ed","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"ZANIEWICZ","uuid":"57C296112A3CA1E2B5DBA8C96547095BA52D9A0F88767466B62803F5F0B4EB92EE0482BBC915DE6529564EEC096C3754C5A2240B04FC380B41E0CA8479197FCB","orcidId":"0000-0001-7942-3644","documentHash":"6f094511-e274-44da-a225-9f0a1d64d35c"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397216","name":"IZABELA","lastName":"BODUS-OLKOWSKA","uuid":"695DFA5F274060E776FA8B0D7D04A28F3AB48F092027C6123A3277F2134AC256F2E9660526299BD7DCE881F9512FB9F7E974063D2B84EC911C311E0BAA419FB3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4366-0116","documentHash":"2b1d3665-1483-40c2-99df-c8511769c8a0"}],"objectId":"68303a3efdbe8312e61ad51f","doi":"10.1484/m.wsa-eb.5.141428","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1484/m.wsa-eb.5.141428","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Between Hydrography and Underwater Ethnoarchaeology: Modelling of Selected Wrecks in the Lower Oder as a Part of Research on the Geoclassification Method of Ferromagnetic Bottom Objects","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In August 2020 the authors undertook aninterdisciplinary survey of twelve wrecks located andinventoried earlier, as part of the project UnderwaterEthnoarchaeology of the Lower Oder.

The hydrographers from theMaritime University of Szczecin and the ethnol-ogist from the University of Szczecin establishedcooperation in this regard. The survey was part ofthe research on the geoclassification method ofanthropogenic, ferrous, underwater objects based onmagnetic anomaly maps. Data acquisition involvedrecording data with an interferometric echo-sounder,side-scan sonar, and marine magnetometer. Thesurvey was done by the research vessel Hydrograf XXI.The results provided new datasets of examinedwrecks, as well as other, previously unknown bottomobjects. This contributed to a better understandingof the underwater cultural heritage resources of theOder River. Moreover, collected data was used tocreate the catalogue of underwater ferromagneticobjects, which is the basis of the geoclassificationmethod. The cooperation of the hydrographersand the ethnologist was an interesting and creativeexperience, whose interdisciplinary value lay inlearning about different research methods andtechniques — in relation to the same object ofresearch. The collected hydrographic data will alsobe used in the project MORGAV: Development ofTechnology Acquisition and Exploration of GravimetricData of Foreshore and Seashore of Polish Maritime Areas(National Centre for Research and Development,Poland, Smart Growth Operational Programme2014–2020, competition: 1/4.1.4/2018)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972ed","5e709284878c28a047397216"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"127-147","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397216","5e709285878c28a0473972ed","68303a3efdbe8312e61ad520"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"67bb370bfdbe835250bce36d","doi":"10.1484/m.wsa-eb.5.137935","title":"Archaeology: Just Add Water","year":2024,"volume":"III","isbn":"978-2-503-61218-8","url":"https://www.brepolsonline.net/action/showBook?doi=10.1484%2FM.WSA-EB.5.137935","translation":false,"documentHash":"aacdbd30-a69a-4b01-ae68-fd5d5749104a","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb74d","mniswId":"300","name":"Brepols Publishers","documentHash":"222b31fc-fc21-4e87-a6c2-98ad7179d314"},"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hydrography","sonar imaging","digital bottom model","geoclassification","underwater ethnoarchaeology","Lower Oder River","wrecks"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039401601"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"683044eefdbe836a46150ee9","name":"Polina","lastName":"Kozlovska","documentHash":"44b45c83-3f06-4ff6-919f-07e14f556bf8"},{"objectId":"6268aaaa7523406b88cecdd6","name":"IRMINA","lastName":"DURLIK","uuid":"97E8690FCCEC355A0AAFB8F87B0FEFE701AE794CFC914CFAA68B463BCCA8D602B65F1A5FF5EF6A118E8D18C82B226D18DA0979BB186B77ACD599A2B5CCA232CB","orcidId":"0000-0002-9684-072X","documentHash":"a137326d-8152-4450-84a6-0286aaf7dd28"},{"objectId":"602f697d9543c7410626f451","name":"EWELINA","lastName":"KOSTECKA","uuid":"FAE53E36C71E8923119AB6D89173C662086FA2DD2608FD7E31A8C3666677341813238759D174B2137EF28B374924B62E9809C7F32662F65A42523967BDD92095","orcidId":"0009-0006-5357-6531","documentHash":"cec65887-1983-402d-b3ca-d4fe7c9a534c"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b52b","name":"TYMOTEUSZ","lastName":"MILLER","uuid":"3E38728F3395592D39A2D5B4026A9FA7DAC2CF742021DB5E9C0101478AF272D682275107576EC79EAE12586C2EA5A6D54CE302DB924E47323F928FC3779B1F92","orcidId":"0000-0002-5962-5334","documentHash":"1a8f4cd1-f13e-40cb-801d-544fe08dd0ae"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972eb","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"ŚLĄCZKA","uuid":"759D7BBB207B434EFA81A5CA6F08F7D206BED69E025A0F821F004076FA7A0CDD9783E41F2B94B43A5AE5CF41E1690AD8A01EDD81784FB6469F9F64AD37799A08","orcidId":"0000-0003-3265-9726","documentHash":"c3a0236f-a4c1-4ffe-8618-771c3f20fc03"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-04-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"683028cafdbe8312e6191ccc","doi":"10.3390/app15094986","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/9/4986","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Enhancing Safety in Autonomous Maritime Transportation Systems with Real-Time AI Agents","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The maritime transportation sector is undergoing a profound shift with the emergence of autonomous vessels powered by real-time artificial intelligence (AI) agents. This article investigates the pivotal role of these agents in enhancing the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of autonomous maritime systems. Following a structured literature review, we examine the architecture of real-time AI agents, including sensor integration, communication systems, and computational infrastructure. We distinguish maritime AI agents from conventional systems by emphasizing their specialized functions, real-time processing demands, and resilience in dynamic environments. Key safety mechanisms—such as collision avoidance, anomaly detection, emergency coordination, and fail-safe operations—are analyzed to demonstrate how AI agents contribute to operational reliability. The study also explores regulatory compliance, focusing on emission control, real-time monitoring, and data governance. Implementation challenges, including limited onboard computational power, legal and ethical constraints, and interoperability issues, are addressed with practical solutions such as edge AI and modular architectures. Finally, the article outlines future research directions involving smart port integration, scalable AI models, and emerging technologies like federated and explainable AI. This work highlights the transformative potential of AI agents in advancing autonomous maritime transportation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f902","uid":"bk_n03ydqnhCQzeW0cj586g","uuid":"dae78b8a-6bdd-4a4c-aeba-e3409b15c413","name":"Instytut Nauk o Morzu i Środowisku","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b52b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972eb","6268aaaa7523406b88cecdd6","602f697d9543c7410626f451"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"4986","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6268aaaa7523406b88cecdd6","5e7092b7878c28a04739b52b","602f697d9543c7410626f451","683044eefdbe836a46150ee9","5e709285878c28a0473972eb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","eissn":"2076-3417","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6811ed8cfdbe834926eccfb1","year":"2025","volume":"15","number":"9","doi":"","documentHash":"38dda905-2369-4b2f-94f4-6df69448e63c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["collision avoidance","cybersecur","emergency response","anomaly detection","regulatory compliance","maritime safety","autonomous maritime systems","real-time processing","ethical AI","AI agents","data governance","computational infrastructure","smart port integration"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748297900897"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"683044c5fdbe836a46150c6c","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Zwolak","documentHash":"46eb624b-03b3-411c-b9e5-aa0522dfc73e"},{"objectId":"683044c5fdbe836a46150c6b","name":"Polina","lastName":"Kozlovska","documentHash":"d950c3e1-aa7b-4980-838a-840d867a5ca2"},{"objectId":"683044c5fdbe836a46150c6a","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Sokołowska","documentHash":"0b15e5a5-b901-459f-9c2d-e501b50648c1"},{"objectId":"6268aaaa7523406b88cecdd6","name":"IRMINA","lastName":"DURLIK","uuid":"97E8690FCCEC355A0AAFB8F87B0FEFE701AE794CFC914CFAA68B463BCCA8D602B65F1A5FF5EF6A118E8D18C82B226D18DA0979BB186B77ACD599A2B5CCA232CB","orcidId":"0000-0002-9684-072X","documentHash":"a137326d-8152-4450-84a6-0286aaf7dd28"},{"objectId":"602f697d9543c7410626f451","name":"EWELINA","lastName":"KOSTECKA","uuid":"FAE53E36C71E8923119AB6D89173C662086FA2DD2608FD7E31A8C3666677341813238759D174B2137EF28B374924B62E9809C7F32662F65A42523967BDD92095","orcidId":"0009-0006-5357-6531","documentHash":"cec65887-1983-402d-b3ca-d4fe7c9a534c"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b52b","name":"TYMOTEUSZ","lastName":"MILLER","uuid":"3E38728F3395592D39A2D5B4026A9FA7DAC2CF742021DB5E9C0101478AF272D682275107576EC79EAE12586C2EA5A6D54CE302DB924E47323F928FC3779B1F92","orcidId":"0000-0002-5962-5334","documentHash":"1a8f4cd1-f13e-40cb-801d-544fe08dd0ae"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-04-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"681afba6fdbe8356ff05a338","doi":"10.3390/electronics14091844","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/9/1844","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Artificial Intelligence in Maritime Cybersecurity : a Systematic Review of AI-Driven Threat Detection and Risk Mitigation Strategies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The maritime industry is undergoing a digital transformation, integrating automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance operational efficiency and safety. However, this technological evolution has also increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities, exposing vessels, ports, and maritime communication networks to sophisticated cyber threats. This systematic review, conducted following the PRISMA guidelines, examines the current landscape of AI-driven cybersecurity solutions in maritime environments. By analyzing peer-reviewed studies and industry reports, this review identifies key AI methodologies, including machine-learning-based intrusion detection systems, anomaly detection mechanisms, predictive threat modeling, and AI-enhanced zero-trust architectures. This study assesses the effectiveness of these techniques in mitigating cyber risks, explores their implementation challenges, and highlights existing research gaps. The findings indicate that AI-powered solutions significantly enhance real-time threat detection and response capabilities in maritime networks, yet issues such as data scarcity, regulatory constraints, and adversarial attacks on AI models remain unresolved. Future research directions should focus on integrating AI with blockchain, federated learning, and quantum cryptographic techniques to strengthen maritime cybersecurity frameworks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f902","uid":"bk_n03ydqnhCQzeW0cj586g","uuid":"dae78b8a-6bdd-4a4c-aeba-e3409b15c413","name":"Instytut Nauk o Morzu i Środowisku","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b52b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6268aaaa7523406b88cecdd6","602f697d9543c7410626f451"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1844","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b52b","6268aaaa7523406b88cecdd6","602f697d9543c7410626f451","683044c5fdbe836a46150c6a","683044c5fdbe836a46150c6b","683044c5fdbe836a46150c6c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bfef","mniswId":"5581","title":"Electronics (Switzerland)","eissn":"2079-9292","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"d24835fa-79e8-41ed-9235-04b77a1dc9bd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6819f7f4fdbe8364f51b7ea6","year":"2025","volume":"14","number":"9","documentHash":"cafd7a85-0f21-445e-a1ce-bd7bd7c51c4b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["autonomous ships","Blockchain","Cybersecurity","anomaly detection","intrusion detection","machine learning","zero trust","artificial intelligence","quantum cryptograp","cyber threats","maritime industry","digital transformation","maritime networks","federated learning"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748297901469"}]
