The material consisted of 945 observations of 340 players. Analysed: total distances covered [km], distances covered with high-intensity running (20–25 km/h) [m], numbers of sprints, numbers of shots, numbers of passes, pass accuracy [%] and the official ranking of national teams. Three categories of time-zone shift (training centre → match venue) were taken account of, i.e. (1) West→East (WE), (2) Same Zone (SZ) and (3) East→West (EW). Analysis of results revealed that players in the EW and SZ categories were able to achieve results significantly better than those moving WE (total distances covered H = 11.815(2); p = 0.003; numbers of passes H = 7.630(2); p = 0.022), and this in relation to team placings in the end-of-tournament ranking (H = 18.099(2); p = 0.001). The results will be valuable in searching places for training centres during future FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship competitions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaa","uid":"bIVuXx-j3MA3vg5GttGgoow","uuid":"7688bf94-399f-4567-854e-220f826816fb","name":"Instytut Geografii i Przestrzennego Zagospodarowania im.

Kickboxing is a full-contact combat sport that has evolved from the knockdown formula characteristics of Kyokushin karate. The aim of the article was to attempt to determine the personality of people training in Kyokushin karate and kickboxing.\nMaterial and method. The study involved people practicing Kyokushin karate (n1 = 30) and kickboxing (n2 = 30) aged 18 to 29. There were 15 women and 15 men in each sample. The NEO-FFI Personality Questionnaire [Costa Jr., McCrae 2007] was the method used.\nResults. The personalities of the karate Kyokushin and kickboxing athletes were at a similar level in all personality dimensions: low neuroticism, high extraversion and conscientiousness, average openness to experience and agreeableness. But women (in general) were more neurotic, extroverted, and conscientious and less open to experiences in relation to men; agreeableness was at a similar level. Women training in Kyokushin karate were more neurotic and conscientious, and less open to experience than men from the same combat sports. Women training in kickboxing were more extroverted and conciliatory to men in the same combat sports.\nConclusions. People competing in the knockdown formula are no different from those competing in the full contact formula and from athletes from other disciplines in all personality traits. Gender is an important personality determinant among combat sports practitioners."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

A total of 410 mothers of children with autism (mean age 39.03, SD 7.42) completed four questionnaires: Parental Burnout Measure (PBM-12), International Personality Item Pool—Big Five Markers (IPIP-BFM-20), Flexibility and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES-IV), and a survey on childcare difficulties. Path analysis using two predetermined models was used to examine the interrelations. Both models fit the empirical data equally with a Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) index of 0.000 and a 90% confidence interval (model 1: 0.000–0.052; model 2: 0.000–0.059). Path analysis revealed similar fit indexes for both models: (a) burnout is a mediator between exogenous variables and family functioning, and (b) family functioning is an indirect mediator between exogenous variables and burnout. These findings suggest that increased maternal emotional instability (neuroticism) and conscientiousness can lead to increased family communication problems, which may further lead to a breakdown of the equilibrium in the family system, resulting in the mother’s dissatisfaction with family life and a consequent increased risk of maternal burnout."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The study sample included 122 individuals (45 boys, 77 girls)  years of secondary school age. Participants were assigned to the HIIT intervention or control groups.

Outcome and potential mediator were residual changes calculated from pre- and postintervention results of MSF components: handgrip (HG), sit-ups (ABS), sit-and-reach (FL), vertical jump (VJ), and Harvard step-test representing cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). MSF index (MSFI) was calculated as a construct, agglomerating all MSF, and tested its usefulness. HIIT significantly impacted CRF in boys and girls (, ; , , respectively). The impact of the HIIT program on the ABS and FL was observed only in girls. The moderation effect of sex was confirmed. Significant effect of HIIT on CRF decreased () and was no significant after including FL (, )—complete mediation, but no ABS (, )—partial mediation. CRF was mediated by changes in ABS (, ) and FL (4.18, ). MSFI was not mediating; its usefulness was limited. HIIT is an effective tool in the development of CRF in both sexes. MSF played a limited role in the relationship between HIIT and CRF. It suggested different mechanisms in both sexes: girls who performed better to the HIIT had better values of FL and ABS, but not boys. HIIT intervention involved modifications in ABS or FL, which also influenced the increase of CRF."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The prevalence of elevated BP is growing among adolescents. There is a need to investigate effective ways of decreasing excessive blood pressure in this age group. The study aim was to determine the effect of 10-weeks High-Intensive Interval Training (HIIT)—Tabata protocol—introduced in physical education (PE) lessons on resting blood pressure in adolescents. The sample included 52 boys aged 16.23 ± 0.33 years body height176.74 ± 6.07 (m), body weight 65.42 ± 12.51 (kg), BMI 20.89 ± 3.53 (kg/m2) and 89 girls aged 16.12 ± 0.42 years, body height 164.38 ± 6.54 (m), body weight 56.71 ± 10.23 (kg), BMI 20.93 ± 3.08 (kg/m2) from secondary school. Based on resting BP, the fractions of boys and girls with normal BP and high BP were identified and divided into experimental (EG) and control (CG) groups. EG completed a 10-weeks HIIT program (three cycles of Tabata protocol) implemented in one PE lesson during a week. The duration of the effort was 14 min. The intensity was at 75–80% of maximal heart rate. Changes in systolic and diastolic BP after the experiment were examined. The results indicated the improvement in SBP in EG with high BP compared to the rest of the groups (average reduction of 12.77 mmHg; p < 0.0001). The EG normotensive had a statistically significant higher reduction of SBP comparing CG normotensive (average decrease of 1.81 mmHG; p = 0.0089). HIIT effectively decreases BP in adolescents. Implementing HIIT in PE lessons in secondary school is recommended to improve BP parameters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Methods: nine participants suffering a SCI participated in the study. Different cognitive functions were evaluated through the following tests: COWAT, Digit Span, Stroop color–word and QoL through the WHOQoL-BREF scale. Results: Generally, participants positively assessed their overall quality of life and health status. Although the tests conducted indicate reduced cognitive function among the athletes, it did not affect the reduction in QoL. Single correlations between the results of cognitive tests and QoL could be treated as coincidental. Conclusions: Despite the observed decline in selected cognitive functions, the participants positively assessed their quality of life and physical health.Reduced cognitive functioning could be influenced by the impact of sleep-disordered breathing, pain, depressive disorders and medication.

However, the level of asymmetry may vary depending on the performance on one or both lower limbs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify the differences in leg stiffness between the dominant and non-dominant lower limb during a two-legged countermovement jump. The research was conducted on 35 s-league basketball players (body height: 1.90 ± 0.08 m, body mass: 81.9 ± 10 kg, age: 19.5 ± 1.7 years). Each participant performed three countermovement jumps with arm swing to the maximum height. Measurements employed a BTS SMART motion analysis system and two Kistler force plates. Statistically significant differences were found during the comparison of leg stiffness in the dominant and non-dominant lower limbs. Inter-limb asymmetry of leg stiffness reached 22.0% in the countermovement phase and 8.9% in the take-off phase. Significant inter-limb asymmetry of leg stiffness might lead to injury or considerably reduce the performance of athletes. Therefore, an important role is to conduct strength and speed-strength trainings with proper loads to both body sides. Coaches should pay more attention to similar lower limbs movement patterns during two-legged exercises and bilateral strength development."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The paper contains research findings regarding participants of an oculomotor training course aimed at the therapy of visual–spatial functions. Five male patients with brain damage who did not communicate, verbally or motorically, participated in the study. Over a six-week period, the subjects solved tasks associated with recognising objects, size perception, colour perception, perception of object structures (letters), perception of object structures (objects), detecting differences between images and assembling image components into the complete image with the use of an eye tracker. The findings present evidence of oculomotor training effectiveness based on a longer duration of the work with the eye tracker and improved visual–spatial functions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Literature includes both behavioral and neuroimaging studies. Unfortunately, no studies are focusing on practice in constant conditions to the best of our knowledge. Hence it is essential to assess possible differences in mechanisms of neuroplasticity between constant vs. variable practice conditions. The primary objectives of the study described in this protocol will be: (1) to determine the brain’s structural and functional changes following constant and variable practice conditions in motor learning (structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, MRI); (2) to determine the EEG activation and connectivity between cognitive, sensory, and motor cerebral cortex areas (central, temporal, parietal, occipital) in constant and variable practice conditions and as a function of practice time.\nMethods: The study will follow the interventional (experimental) design with two arms (parallel groups). Fifty participants will be randomly assigned to two groups practicing in constant (CG) and variable conditions (VG). CG will be practicing only one pattern of step isometric contractions during unimanual index finger abduction, i.e., 90 trials in all training sessions, whereas VG will practice three different patterns. Each will be practiced 30 times per session in variable conditions. Resting-state fMRI, EEG (cortical networking), and motor task proficiency will be examined before (pre-) and after practice (post- and retentions tests).\nDiscussion: Findings will enhance our understanding of structural and functional neural changes following practice in constant and variable conditions.

For example, several experiments show that children’s participation in Eduball, i.e., a method that uses educational balls with printed letters, numbers, and other signs, improves their physical fitness while simultaneously developing their mathematical and language skills. However, the question of who should conduct such classes to make them most effective (regular classroom teachers, physical education teachers, or maybe both in cooperation?) remains unanswered. Here, we replicated a previous Eduball experiment, but now, instead of one experimental group, there were three. In the first, Eduball-classes were conducted by the classroom teacher, in the second, by the physical education teacher, and in the third, collaboratively. After one year intervention, all experimental groups significantly improved both their cognitive (mathematical, reading, and writing) and gross motor (locomotor and object control) skills, and these effects were larger than in the control group participating in traditional PE. Importantly, there were no differences in progression between the Eduball-groups. Thus, our study demonstrates that methods linking PE with cognitive tasks can be effectively used by both PE specialists and general classroom teachers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This paper aims at validating the connection between personality and sport experience. The research subject of were young Polish male athletes (N = 1,260) aged 20–29, out of 42 sports disciplines, with sport experience ranging from 3 to 12 years. In order to test the personality of the research subjects, a five-factor model of personality called the Big Five was applied. Statistical calculations and analyses were carried out with ver. 25 of the IBM SPSS Statistics software. The research has shown that all personality traits correlate in a statistically significant way with sport experience (p < 0.001): there is a negative correlation of sports experience with neuroticism and a positive correlation with traits such as extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Thus, we have identified a relationship between sport experience and personality traits of the researched Polish male athletes—the longer the sport experience, the lower level of neuroticism and higher levels of extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Duration of sport experience has a considerable influence on forming the personality of Polish male athletes. However, the interpretation of just the results regarding high level of extraversion and conscientiousness distinguishes Polish male athletes (20–29 years old) from the Polish male population of non-training people."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The study included 70 women aged over 60 with a mean age of 72.28 years. In order to determine mental well-being, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used at four time points: January, April, September and December 2020. A self-developed questionnaire was used to determine predictors of mental well-being. Two-way ANOVA demonstrated a lack of significant differences between the means in the GDS scores at the four data collection time points (p = 0.21). Frequent use of green areas reduced the GDS score on average by 1.52 points (p = 0.01), while owning a garden by 1.51 points (p = 0.04).

Design: Narrative systematic review. Methods: An extensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Google Scholar, Science direct and EMBASE from inception to April 2021. Studies were included if they: (1) reported biomechanical analysis of judo throws and Ukemi; (2) were on adult judoka populations; (3) discussed injury related to judo technique. The included studies were assessed for risk of bias using a five-part modified STROBE checklist. A narrative synthesis was performed due to the heterogeneity of included studies. Results: 173 titles and abstracts were screened with 16 studies (158 judokas, 9 of which were female) included. All studies used 3D biomechanical analysis to assess Ukemi. Ukemi implementation produced reduced kinematic data in comparison to direct occipital contact, which was always below the injury threshold. Analysis of lower limb and trunk kinematics revealed variances in Ukemi between novice and experienced judoka. Whilst no significant differences were seen in neck flexion angles, hip, knee and trunk angle time plots revealed greater extension angles in experienced judokas. Conclusions: Ukemi is essential in preventing head and neck injuries; however, technique differs between experienced and novice judoka. Larger flexion angles of the hip, knee and trunk are seen in novice judoka, which correlate with increased kinematic data. The association of greater neck muscle strength with improved Ukemi is weak. However, a negative correlation was established between fatigue and breakfall skill by one study."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

In this research, we aimed to assess the effect of elevated blood lead level on age at menarche (AM), controlling for body mass index (BMI) and estimated fatness. The sample included 490 girls aged 7–16 examined in Polkowice town (Copper Basin, Poland) in 2008. Measurements included height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and estimated percentage of body fat. AM was assessed using the status quo method. Blood samples were taken for lead level assessment. Two groups were defined based on the median blood lead level for the total sample of children (3.7 µg/dL). Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between AM and independent variables. The results indicated that menarche in the higher blood lead level group was significantly later compared to the lower blood lead level group (p < 0.01). This relationship remained only marginally significant when BMI (p < 0.10), sum of skinfolds (p < 0.09) or percentage of fat (p < 0.08) were controlled.

Sixty riders of professional clubs in the Polish top motorcycle speedway league participated in this study. They were divided into two equal groups (n = 30): junior (age = 19.7 ± 1.1 years) and senior (age = 29.7 ± 5.2). Body composition assessment, Wingate test (WAnT) on cycloergometer, with analysis of acute cardiorespiratory and biochemical responses were performed. Sport level was defined as the number of heats (races) won, winning percentage, total points scored during the season, and average points scored per heat. Seniors had higher point ratings indicating sport levels. As compared to the seniors, the juniors had lower BMI 4% (p < 0.01) and fat tissue mass by 20.5% (p < 0.01). A higher power decrease of 2.3% (p < 0.05) in the WAnT test was found in seniors. Body height negatively correlated with all indicators of seniors’ sport level (r = −0.41 to −0.55). Peak power output negatively correlated with seniors’ sport level (r = −0.39 to −0.41). Among the seniors, there was a negative correlation between post-exercise hydrogen ion concentration (r = −0.38), carbon dioxide partial pressure (r = −0.45) and average points scored per season. Conclusion: The anthropometric characteristics of body height, lean body mass and body surface area, are significantly correlated with the sport levels of the seniors motorcycle speedway riders. When selecting motorcycle speedway riders, use of these anthropometric characteristics may aid in determining the riders with the most potential to be successful. Metabolic acidosis tolerance and gas exchange efficiency show significance in seniors, indicating the need for intense exercise sessions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The study group consisted of 137 cadets of the Military University of Land Forces. The measure of alternating attention in the study was the Color Trails Test results. Motor components were assessed by measuring hand static strength, endurance run, and time of a speed and agility run. SA and PMS were taken as measures of cadets’ CT. Significantly higher PMS were associated with higher levels of strength and better endurance in cadets. The physical fitness of the cadets did not significantly affect the cadets’ SA. The main result of the study is the revelation of the level of alternating attention as a strong determinant of cadets’ SA. The authors suggest that the main emphasis should be put on the physical preparation of a modern soldier, focused on the development of strength and endurance skills. It is also reasonable to introduce cognitive stimulation exercises to shooting training."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

It remains unknown how fatness affects the influence of CRF on BP. Therefore, the aim was to examine whether the associations between baseline CRF and HIIT-postintervention resting BP were mediated through fatness in adolescents. Material and methods: The sample (n = 64) comprised 28 boys 36 girls aged 16 years. The analysed factors were fitness index- reflecting CRF, body fat mass (BFM), fat mass index (FMI), and body mass index (BMI). Bootstrapped mediation procedures were performed. The mediation analysis was conducted concerning the sex moderation effect. Results: The mediation effect of sex was confirmed; therefore, mediations models were designed separately for boys and girls. The results showed a statistically significant inverse relationship between baseline CRF and post-intervention systolic blood pressure (SBP) in both sexes (boys: B = −0.603, p = 0.010; girls: B = −0.394, p = 0.037).

To this purpose, a qualitative research study was carried out with members of the ‘Gracje’ dance group. The study used Jürgen Habermas’s theory of communicative action as its theoretical underpinnings. The focus was on the models of action and validity claims expressed in language (narrative). In this theoretical framework, dancing activity has been shown as promoting not only physical health and mental wellbeing but also social involvement. Our study has found that, in and through dance, the older adults primarily realised their claims to pleasure, attractiveness, health and emancipation. This has considerably improved their bodily capacity and increased their self-esteem. However, what the older adults themselves find most important is that the realisation of these claims beneficially affects their interactions in family and neighbourly communities and facilitates their engagement in volunteer activities, helping people at risk of exclusion due to age and/or disability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a0473913b1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 10 min warm-up with ARDSv on performance, physiological and biochemical responses during sprint interval cycling exercise (SIE). During four laboratory visits at least 72 h apart, they completed: (1) an incremental exercise test (IET) on a cycloergometer, (2) a familiarization session, and cross-over SIE sessions conducted in random order on visits (3) and (4). During one of them, 1200 mL of ARDSv was used for breathing over a 10-min warm-up. SIE consisted of 6 × 10-s all-out bouts with 4-min active recovery. Work capacity, cardiopulmonary parameters, body temperature, respiratory muscle strength, blood acid-base balance, lactate concentration, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were analyzed. After warm-up with ARDSv, PETCO2 was 45.0 ± 3.7 vs. 41.6 ± 2.5 (mm Hg) (p < 0.001). Body temperature was 0.6 (°C) higher after this form of warm-up (p < 0.05), bicarbonate concentration increased by 1.8 (mmol⋅L–1) (p < 0.01). As a result, work performed was 2.9% greater (p < 0.01) compared to the control condition. Respiratory muscle strength did not decreased. Warming up with added respiratory dead space volume mask prior to cycling SIE produces an ergogenic effect by increasing body temperature and buffering capacity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Material and methods: We studied the biological responses of a group of seventeen judo club coaches between the ages of 39 and 57 years to a one-day judo tournament attended by the adult male and/or female athletes that they coached. At the time of the tournaments and also in neutral conditions, the coaches’ capillary blood and saliva samples were collected concurrently two times a day, both at 7:30 a.m. and after completion of the tournament (at about 8:00 p.m.). Cardiovascular parameters were also determined at the same times of day. Sleep quality (SQ) was assessed on a 6-point scale both on the night preceding the tournament and in neutral conditions. Cortisol (C) and testosterone (T) levels were determined from serum and saliva samples. The results for both days at different times of day were compared. Results: Statistical calculations showed higher concentrations of cortisol and a greater reduction of testosterone levels in serum and saliva at the end of the day during the tournament compared with those on a neutral day. Morning and evening cardiovascular indices were higher during the tournament. Conclusion: The study showed that during one-day tournaments, judo coaches were exposed to stress that induced intermittent hormonal changes in blood and saliva and activated the autonomic nervous system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Pre-testing and post-testing sessions involved assessments of Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test level 1, 30-15 intermittent fitness test, 5 and 30 m sprint times, vertical jump height, repeated sprint ability, defensive and offensive agility, and technical skills. The SSGs group demonstrated significantly higher agility-based technical responses in terms of the control dribbling and shooting skills (d = 1.71 vs. 0.20, d = 1.41 vs. 0.35, respectively) compared with the HIIT group. Conversely, the HIIT induced greater improvements in 30 m sprint times (d = 3.15 vs. 0.68). These findings provided that SSGs in youth basketball players may allow similar positive physical adaptations to HIIT, with an extra advantage of improving technical skills while improving enjoyability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Results indicated (i) similar values of RP irrespective of whether the teams qualified from the group stage into the knockout stage of the UCL, and (ii) trivial-to-small correlations between RP and total group points.

This work aims to assess the likelihood of soft and hard tissue injuries in top-level judokas during competition with defining factors that determine the probability of injury occurrence.\n\nMethods\nThe injuries that occurred in 123 official international competitions from 2005–2019 were recorded by the European Judo Union (EJU) Medical Commission as a survey that was a part of the EJU Injury Registration form with internal consistency shown by a Crombach Alpha of 0.69. This survey data identified factors such as: sex, anatomical localisation of injury, type of injury, tissue involved and mechanisms of the injury. A total of 650 tissue injuries were reported correctly in terms of tissue injury definition.\n\nResults\nThe most frequent soft tissue injury (STI) reported was a ligament STI (48.15%), closely followed by skin STI (12.15%) and muscles STI (11.38%). In turn, the most frequent hard tissue injury occurred in bones (8.56%). The highest rates of injuries occurred during the fight in the standing position (78%). Injuries in the standing position mainly occurred while executing a throw (25.85%) and followed by the attempt to throw, i.e., the action of reaching the throwing position (22.30%), grip fighting (15.07%), and during falls (14.77%). Opposite to this, fight in groundwork reached only 18.30% soft and hard tissue injuries combined. The ongoing registration of injuries during judo combat and training and the early diagnosis of risk factors for injuries are the basis for the development of effective strategies for injury prevention and further treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Two throws implicated in shoulder injury are tai-otoshi and morote-seoi-nage. Kinematic investigation can provide insight into possible shoulder injury mechanisms and allow for appropriate preventative measures to be suggested. We used two-dimensional (2D) video analysis to measure and compare: (a) the peak acceleration and (b) the peak velocity of uke’s shoulder when tai-otoshi and morote-seoi-nage were performed by elite adult judoka. Methods: Eight male participants were recruited from the Budokwai Judo Club in London, UK. The mean age, height, and weight of participants were 25.4 ± 5.2 years (18–34), 1.7 ± 0.0 m (1.7–1.8), and 75.0 ± 5.2 kg (66–80), respectively. Throws were recorded using an iPhone 6S camera and uploaded onto Kinovea for subsequent processing. Results: The peak acceleration (m/s2) was greater in tai-otoshi (71.6 ± 12.4) compared to morote-seoi-nage (67.9 ± 9.9), although this was statistically insignificant. The peak velocity (m/s) was significantly greater (p = 0.030) in tai-otoshi (5.1 ± 0.8) than in morote-seoi-nage (4.5 ± 0.6). Conclusions: A greater peak velocity in tai-otoshi suggests that the shoulder is subjected to increased loads upon impact. This may indicate that tai-otoshi carries a greater risk of shoulder injury. Nage-komi (repetitive throwing) practices in training should follow gradual loading principles—beginning with morote-seoi-nage, before moving to tai-otoshi, for example. We must be aware of any assumptions made in estimations of impact force, and future in vivo research is required to provide more definitive values. Meanwhile, coaches must continue to ensure that correct ukemi (breakfall) technique is displayed by athletes before performing throws."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Fifty-eight men aged 23.8 ± 1.2 years and forty-seven women aged 23.3 ± 1.0 years were examined. Physical activity level was measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and injury data were collected with the Injury History Questionnaire. The countermovement jump was performed to evaluate force and power. LL tissue composition was evaluated by a bioimpedance analyzer. The symmetry indices were calculated. A comparison between injured and non-injured subjects in both sexes was conducted to determine indices associated with injuries. The symmetry indices cut-off points were calculated to establish values indicating a significant injury risk increase, and logistic regression was performed. The relative peak force asymmetry above 4.049% was associated with increased injury risk in men. The LL skeletal muscle mass asymmetry above 3.584% was associated with a higher injury risk in women. Increased asymmetry in indicated indices by 1% was associated with 19.8% higher injury risk in men and 82.6% in women. Asymmetry proved to be an injury risk factor. However, a more suitable index for men is relative peak force asymmetry, whereas LL skeletal muscle mass asymmetry is more suitable for women."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

In our investigation, we wanted to explore the hormonal response (testosterone and cortisol) in saliva after acute exercises in men who perform endurance-training and strength-training exercises compared to a non-training group. Participants performed sprint interval exercise. During the whole exercise, the participants’ heart rates were measured, and a rating of perceived exertion was assessed immediately after each bout. The study showed that there were no differences in testosterone and cortisol changes in the endurance-training, strength-training, and non-training groups after the sprint interval exercise. We suppose that one session of the sprint interval training should have more volume (more or longer duration of sprints) to provoke testosterone and cortisol reaction in endurance-training and strength-training individuals.

Significant reductions in HADS total score, the HADS-A, general stress score, emotional tension, and the external stress were obtained. In the CG, a deterioration in all measured parameters was observed. Significant changes were obtained in the general stress score and intrapsychic stress. The analysis between groups showed that the effectiveness of psychological interventions significantly differed between groups.

Physical conditions are recognized to be optimal after the pre-season (PS) phase in professional sports. Given that blood measures may also reveal variations, which in turn, may present associations with fitness changes. Objective. The aim of this study is to test the changes of blood markers and physical fitness outcomes at the beginning and following the PS phase. Additionally, we aimed also to analyze the associations of training adaptations between blood markers and the physical fitness measures. Methodology. 25 professional male soccer players (28.1 ± 4.6 years old, 2.0 ± 7.8 kg, and 176.7 ± 4.9 cm) were assessed for hematological and biochemical parameters, and physical fitness measures in the baseline and after the phase of PS. Results. Increases in platelets were observed after the PS phase (p = 0.001, η2 = 0.39). Regarding the biochemical parameters, significant increases between PS were found for creatinine (Cre) (p = 0.001, η2 = 0.66), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (p = 0.001, η2 = 0.79), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (p = 0.001, η2 = 0.74), cortisol (C) (p = 0.001, η2 = 0.63), and testosterone (T) (p = 0.001, η2 = 0.76), whereas significant decreases were found for albumin (Alb) (p = 0.004, η2 = 0.29), and calcium corrected (Ca Corr.) (p = 0.002, η2 = 0.32). Moderate correlations were found between albumin and the 5-meter linear sprint split (r = –0.44 (95%CI: –0.71; –0.05)) and CRP (r = –0.48 (95%CI: –0.74; –0.10)). Moderate correlations were found between VAMEVAL and hemoglobin (r = 0.44 (95%CI: 0.05; 0.71)). Conclusions. The overall physical fitness measures improved after the PS phase. Also, significant variations (decreases/increases) were observed for the case of biomchemical and hematological outcomes. Coaches should carefully consider the adaptative changes observed in blood parameters as the changes in whole organism and metabolism after specific critical phases as the PS in professional players. Thus, optimal management of stimulus/recovery can be warranted to minimize illness and injury rate and to follow the direction and dynamics of adaptative changes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Variables, such as average number of collected points, total distance (TD), total distance per minute (TD/min), high-speed running (HSR), sprinting and number of high-intensity runs (NHIR), were analysed in the last 15 games of DC and 15 matches of NC. These periods were divided into 3 blocks out of 5 matches (5-match blocks). NC collected a significantly higher number of points than DC (p = 0.015), whereas average points collected by UNC were significantly greater than DC (p < 0.001 and NC (p = 0.012). TD and TD/min for DC were significantly lower (p < 0.001) compared with both NC and UnC, whereas significant differences in HSR (p = 0.003) and NHIR (p = 0.03) were identified between DC and NC. The current study reported that mid-season coach turnover may result in short-term improvement in team results and physical match performance. However, this effect disappears after a period of approximately 5 games."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

However, little is known about vitamin D metabolites and their association with physical performance in athletes. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine the relationship between metabolites of vitamin D, vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), free, bioavailable 25-(OH)D, and physical fitness tests in athletes. A total of 40 indoor and outdoor players (16 judoists and 24 football players) participated in the study. Vitamin D metabolites (25-(OH)D, 24,25-(OH)2D3, 3-epi-25-(OH)D3, and 1,25-(OH)2D) were assessed using LM-MS/MS. Free 25-(OH)D concentration was evaluated by calculation using serum albumin and VDBP levels. Athletic performance was assessed using handgrip and vertical jump. Our study showed a significant correlation between vitamin D metabolites and handgrip strength and vertical jump variables in indoor players. It demonstrated a significant association between 3-epi-25-(OH)D3 and vertical jump parameters in outdoor players. The results of our study showed relationship between free, bioavailable 25-(OH)D, and vertical jump variables in indoor players. In conclusion, we provide novel information on the vitamin D metabolites and athletic performance in athletes.

In view of the above, the research hypothesis was formulated that some children, despite regular attendance at swimming classes, do not achieve the learning outcomes set in the curriculum. The reason for this may be unfavorable (compared to their peers) morphological and functional characteristics, coordination motor abilities, and problems with fear of water. Methods: The study was conducted on a group of 271 students from the third grade of elementary schools who could not swim when they entered the physical education classes at the swimming pool and then participated in at least 25 swimming lessons during the school year. After these classes, the students performed swimming tests, and their somatic and functional characteristics and coordination motor abilities were measured. Results: In 46.1% of the participants, the final achievement level was lower than assumed in the school curriculum. The biggest problem for teachers and students in the initial teaching and learning to swim was the high fear of water, especially among girls. Furthermore, children characterized by lower body height and body weight, a lower sum of three skinfolds, and lower BMI had problems with progress in swimming. Despite the differences, these values did not correlate significantly with the final achievement level in swimming, except for body height in boys. Slower progress in swimming was also associated with lower vital capacity, whereas no relationship was found between final achievement level in swimming and trunk flexibility or foot mobility. However, significant correlations occurred for coordination motor abilities, as in almost all tests the participants characterized by the achievement level below the objectives set out in the curriculum performed significantly worse than children in the group with the achievement level meeting the objectives. Conclusions: In many cases, children who begin learning to swim from scratch make significant progress, but for many of them, the achievement levels are lower than the requirements set out in the school curriculum. The biggest problem for teachers and students in the initial teaching and learning to swim was the high fear of water, especially among girls."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the intergenerational changes in the age of menarche of girls living in rural and urban communities in the industrial region of Poland using samples from two different centuries and to determine the relationship between family structure (two-parent and single-parent) and sexual maturation of the girls in both environments. Methods: The study included 3643 rural and urban girls aged 7–16 from southwestern Poland (Copper Basin). The research was cross-sectional in each environment around 2000 and 2010, and it was carried out twice. Two types of family structure were taken into account: two-parent and single-parent families. The median age of menarche and odds ratio (OR) of menarche depending on the place of residence and family structure were calculated. The status quo method was used when assessing the age of menarche. Results: In both groups, the age of menarche significantly decreased during the decade. The median age of menarche in the urban girls was lower compared with their rural peers, but a significant difference was found only during the second examination (a decade after the first examination). There were no significant changes in menarche during the decade regarding family structure (neither in girls from two-parent families nor those from single-parent families), except in rural girls from two-parent families. Comparing the median age of menarche of girls from two-parent families with girls from single-parent families (urban and rural) showed lower median values in the girls from two-parent families, but no differences were significant. Conclusions: The acceleration of the maturation rate over the last decade has been observed among both rural and urban girls. Environmental differences in maturation rates between rural and urban girls increased over the course of the decade, and the difference between the rural and urban girls’ age of menarche was statistically significant in the second examination (around 2010).The living conditions related to family structure did not significantly affect the timing of menarche."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Pain symptoms can be chronic and aggravated by comorbidities. Back pain leads to reduced function, difficulty performing activities of daily living, and prevents physical activity. Massage is one of the more commonly used forms of physiotherapy for these complaints. Aim of the study: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic massage for spinal pain in older adults. Material and methods: Twenty-three participants, including 18 females and 5 males aged 61–85 years old, participated in the study. All patients had degenerative lesions of the spine that were diagnosed by their primary care physician. Patients received classical therapeutic back massages for a period of 3 weeks at a frequency of 2 times a week. Each treatment session was 40-minute-long. Analysis of pain was performed before and immediately after therapy to assess changes in pain. The McGill (short form) and the WHOQL-BREF questionnaires were used to assess the level and quality of life of the study participants. Pain intensity was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS). Results: There was a reduction in pain intensity (VAS) and pain perception after massage therapy, with changes in the sensory and emotional components of the pain score. The changes were statistically significant. Quality of life measured by the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire was at a good level. Elderly participants rated social relationships the highest and physical components the lowest. Conclusions: Massage therapy resulted in a reduction of spinal pain in older adults. Massage is an effective form of therapy for reducing back pain in older adults."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

It is necessary to monitor muscle quality in basic pediatric preventive health care, especially due to the increase in negative health behaviors during a pandemic. The aims of this study were to assess body composition and muscle strength as well as to analyze the relationship between muscle functional quality and impedance parameters in 6- and 7-y-old children.\n\nMethods\nThe study involved 292 healthy 6- and 7-y-old children. Handgrip strength and bioimpedance parameters were measured. Body composition components, including appendicular skeletal muscle mass, were estimated. Handgrip strength in relation to the appendicular skeletal muscles mass was adopted as an indicator of the muscle functional quality. The relationship between the muscle quality index and impedance parameters was assessed by multiple regression.\n\nResults\nA 1-y age difference between the children differentiated not only basic somatic parameters, body composition, and handgrip strength, but also the electrical properties of the tissues. The relative difference in muscle mass between younger and older children was twice that of the muscle strength. A significant regression model of the muscle quality index was obtained, in which reactance and impedance phase angle were strong positive predictors. Adjusted fat mass negatively correlated with the muscle quality.\n\nConclusions\nReactance and phase angle are good indicators of the quality of appendicular skeletal muscle in healthy children and can be potentially used in pediatric preventive health care and screening."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

However, young athletes should take special care when they participate in intense physical training, to ensure their proper physical development. The aim of this study was to evaluate the body posture in the sagittal plane of soccer players in comparison with healthy untrained peers. Methods: A total of 245 young males aged 8–13 who participated in the study were divided into two groups: “Group F—Footballer”, elite youth soccer players comprising 132 male athletes, and “Group C—Control group”, consisting of 113 boys from primary schools. The elite, youth soccer players played and trained in the Gold Standard Certificate Academy for their age group and belonged to the top 1% of all players from their category, respectively (Polish Soccer Association (PZPN)). The control group consisted of healthy boys from primary schools in Wroclaw not practicing any sport. A photogrammetric method based on the projection moiré phenomenon was used to assess the body posture in all subjects. Results: The analysis showed statistically significant differences in body posture parameters in the sagittal plane between the trained (F) and non-trained (C) groups. In all age groups, a significantly higher value of the upper thoracic angle and a lower value of the trunk inclination angle were observed in the football players’ group. Significant differences were also observed for the thoracic spine in each age group. In the groups of 8–9 and 12–13 years, they concerned the angle of thoracic kyphosis, and in the group of 10–11-year-old, the depth of thoracic kyphosis. In the group of children with ages 8–9 and 10–11, significantly higher values of lumbosacral angle and upper thoracic angle were observed in the group of soccer players. Conclusions: The soccer training load can influence the anterior–posterior curvature of the spine. In the group of footballers in all age groups, higher angular values of thoracic kyphosis and greater tilt of the torso forward were found, compared with their untrained peers. There were also significant differences in body posture between children of different ages, both in the group of footballers and in the group of untrained children. In the group of footballers, the differences concerned mainly the size of the lumbosacral angle and the depth of both curves, which decreased with the age of the players. A similar phenomenon was observed in the group of untrained boys but only in children in the older age groups."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of a 6-month training program on the training-related stress indicators (creatine kinase – CK; cortisol – COR; serotonin – SER; brain-derived neurotrophic factor – BDNF) in youth soccer players.\n\nMethods\nEighteen players (17.8 ± 0.9 years old, body height 181.6 ± 6.9 cm, training experience 9.7 ± 1.7 years) were blood-tested four times: at the start of the preparation period (T0), immediately following the preparation period (T1), mid-competitive period (T2), and at the end of the competitive period (T3). CK activity as well as concentrations of serum COR, SER and BDNF were determined. Training loads were recorded using a session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE).\n\nResults\nStatistical analyzes revealed significant effects for all biochemical parameters in relation to their time measurements (T0, T1, T2, T3). The statistical analyzes of sRPE and differences of biochemical parameters in their subsequent measurements (T0–T1, T1–T2, T2–T3) also demonstrated significant effects observed for all variables: sRPE (HKW = 13.189 (df = 2); p = 0.00), COR (HKW = 9.261 (df = 2); p = 0.01), CK (HKW = 12.492 (df = 2); p = 0.00), SER (HKW = 7.781 (df = 2); p = 0.02) and BDNF (HKW = 15.160 (df = 2); p < 0.001).\n\nDiscussion\nIn conclusion, it should be stated that the most demanding training loads applied in the preparation period (highest sRPE values) resulted in a significant increase in all analyzed biochemical training stress indicators. The reduction in the training loads during a competitive period and the addition of recovery training sessions resulted in a systematic decrease in the values of the measured biochemical indicators. The results of the study showed that both subjective and objective markers, including training loads, are useful in monitoring training stress in youth soccer players."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

However, the stay-at-home order could have reduced PA the most, i.e., the ban of unnecessary outdoor activities. It affected free walking, running, skiing, active tourism, etc. It is, therefore, crucial to estimate how the stay-at-home order affected PA. We estimated how the stay-at-home order affected perceived PA and sedentary behavior compared to the pre-pandemic time in Poland.\n\nMethods\nWe used a self-reported International Physical Activity Questionnaire—Long Form (IPAQ-LF) to estimate the time (minutes per day) of vigorous and moderate PA and walking and sitting time.\n\nResults\nWe gathered data from 320 Polish participants. Bayesian approaches, including t-test and Bayesian correlations, were used to find differences and correlations between PA before and during the stay-at-home lockdown. Our data supported the hypotheses that vigorous PA, as well as walking, declined during the lockdown. Surprisingly, our data did not support the hypothesis that moderate physical activity was reduced. We found that moderate PA during lockdown increased compared to the pre-lockdown PA. As hypothesized, our data strongly evinced that sitting time inclined during the lockdown. PA decline was not correlated with the available living space. People who had access to gardens did not demonstrate a higher PA level than those without.\n\nDiscussion\nWalking and sitting time have drastically changed during the stay-at-home lockdown, decreasing and increasing, respectively. Given results from studies focusing on lockdowns without the stay-at-home restriction, it may be assumed that letting people go outside is crucial in keeping them more active and less sedentary. Authorities should take into account the effect the stay-at-home order may have on PA and sedentary behavior and as a result, on health. Stay-at-home orders should be the last considered restriction, given its detrimental consequences."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

EF are also very important for the effective performance of military tasks including the shooting performance (SP) of soldiers. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of EF with SP and gender differences in the level of these traits among cadets of the General Tadeusz Kosciuszko Military University of Land Forces in Wroclaw i.e., 156 persons (19 females and 137 males). The level of EF and processes related to attention was measured with usage of the Color Trails Test (CTT-1 and CTT-2). SP was assessed on the basis of scores from four different small arms and rifle shootings at a fixed target and at emerging targets. The relations between explained and explanatory variables were assessed using Spearman correlation. The variation in the mean values of CTT scores and SP of men and women was compared using the Mann–Whitney U test for independent samples. The results of the present study did not reveal any significant differences between women and men in the level of EF and SP. The key finding of the present study is that the higher SP of males in all shooting events of the study and of females in pistol shooting were significantly correlated with higher executive functions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"6152e0b72467f02da4b041cf","name":"Department of Physical Education and Sport, General Tadeusz Kosciuszko Military University of Land Forces","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709299878c28a047398bdf","5e70934d878c28a0473a6e1e"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

However, a small number of studies assess the relationship between motor abilities and the effectiveness of volleyball technical skills. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the impact of the strength of the upper and lower limbs on the efficiency of serve reception during a 2 vs. 2 game, as well as to evaluate the results of motor measurements in the context of determining the usefulness of current testing procedures. The study involved a carefully chosen group of 12 girls aged 12–13 years (body height:  cm, body mass:  kg, and training experience:  months) selected for the Lower Silesian Regional Volleyball Team. The following tests were conducted: handgrip strength with a hand dynamometer, bent-arm hang, 2 kg medicine ball throw, shoulder joint internal rotators (IR) peak torque, standing long jump, spike jump, and countermovement jump. The measurements of the shoulder joint IR peak torque were performed under isometric (at 10°, 35°, and 65° rotation angles) and isokinetic (at 60°/s, 180°/s, and 300°/s) conditions. The efficiency of serve reception was evaluated during a 2 vs. 2 games by using Data Volley statistical software. The strongest positive relationships were observed between the serve reception efficiency and the peak torque and power of the shoulder joint IR, the medicine ball throw distance, and handgrip strength. Jumping variables showed no associations with efficient of serve reception. Consequently, we suggest adding protocols to volleyball training that include strength exercises aimed at developing the IR muscle group.

The aim of the study was to analyse if there is a correlation between occurrence of SPD and the time or the way of delivery. Participants were 75 children, ages 5–9 years old. Children born prematurely (n = 25), and children delivered by caesarean section (C-section) (n = 25) were compared to the ones born on time by natural means (n = 25). Research was based on a questionnaire filled by children’s parents. Descriptive results and percentage calculations were compared. SPD were detected among 84% of pre-borns and among 80% of children delivered by C-section and it is statistically significant.

However, little is known about the accuracy of these diagnoses as potential predictors of musculoskeletal injuries. Therefore, this study aims to indicate the cut-off points of relative body mass (BMI), fat mass index (FMI), skeletal muscle mass (SMI), and muscle to fat ratio (MFR) and establish its reliability in injury prediction for physically active men and women.\n\nMethods\nThe sample included 119 physically active individuals aged 23.72 ± 1.12 (66 men body height 1.79 ± 0.07 (m); body weight 80.51 ± 9.85 (kg) and 53 women body height 1.67 ± 0.08 (m); body weight 62 ± 10.72 (kg)), students at university of physical education in Poland. The participants’ physical activity was measured with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The relevance of body mass index (BMI), fat mass index (FMI), skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), and muscle to fat ratio (MFR) in detecting injury risk was examined. Musculoskeletal injuries during 1 year before examination were registered using a self-reporting questionnaire. The areas under the curve (AUC) and Youden Index in the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were calculated.\n\nResults\nThe cut-off points used to classify the indices among men were BMI = 24.38; FMI = 3.74; SMI = 16.40; MFR = 3.70; and for women BMI = 20.90; FMI = 4.17; SMI = 8.96; MFR = 1.67. Results suggested the greatest reliability in the prediction of musculoskeletal injuries among men had BMI (AUC = 0.623; Youden = 0.30) and SMI (AUC = 0.608; Youden = 0.23) whereas among women, MFR (AUC = 0.628; Youden = 0.29) and FMI (AUC = 0.614; Youden = 0.32).\n\nConclusion\nBMI and SMI are the most appropriate indices to predict the risk of musculoskeletal injury in physically active men, whereas in women, MFR and FMI are more reliable. These results indicate that the indices with more muscle mass meaning are better in predicting injury among men. In contrast, indices with a higher contribution of fat are better for women. It indicates sex differentiation of injury risk conditions. Men should focus on developing muscle mass, whereas women should reduce body fat to decrease injury risk. However, widespread use seemed to be limited to the specific examined group. Therefore, cut-off points should be used with caution, and calculated values should be verified and confirmed in subsequent studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The aim of this study was, therefore, to assess the functional outcomes of stroke patients with and without aphasia, who were undertaking a regular rehabilitation programme. Materials and Methods: The study group consisted of 116 post-stroke patients, including 54 patients without aphasia (G1) and 62 patients with aphasia (G2). The following tests were used before (T1) and after (T2) rehabilitation measurement points: Barthel Index (BI), Sitting Assessment Scale (SAS), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Trunk Control Test (TCT), Test Up & Go (TUG) and the Timed Walk Test (TWT). Results: The group of post-stroke patients with aphasia had a significantly longer time since a stroke on admission, a significantly longer length of stay in the ward and significantly worse SAS and TCT scores at T2, compared to patients without aphasia. Both groups achieved significant improvement in all studied parameters (SAS, TCT, BI, BBS, TUG and TWT). Aphasia was a predictor of functional status in the stroke patients group, but only at the time of admission to the ward. Conclusions: Patients with and without aphasia have an equal likelihood of improving their functional status and returning to independence. Aphasia should not be an absolute factor that excludes stroke patients from research studies on their functional status."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Hormonal tests included cortisol, testosterone and growth hormone (GH), whereas the antioxidant assessment included superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH). Results: Between-group analysis revealed no significant differences at baseline, whereas it revealed that HIRT presented significant better results than the control group on YYIRT (p = 0.032), 10 m ST (p = 0.041), 20 m ST (p = 0.040), 30 m ST (p = 0.044), RAST (p = 0.013), and COD (p = 0.031) after the intervention period. The within group analysis revealed that the HIRT group significantly improved the YYIRT1 (p < 0.001), VO2max (p < 0.001), 10 m ST (p < 0.001), 20 m ST (p = 0.006), 30 m ST (p < 0.001), RAST (p < 0.001) and COD (p < 0.001). Moreover, HIRT group significantly reduced the cortisol (p < 0.001) and MDA (p = 0.021), whereas it significantly increased the GH (p < 0.001), testosterone (p < 0.001), SOD (p = 0.009) and GSH (p = 0.005). Conclusions: The HIRT is effective for improving physical fitness, revealing significant better adaptations than controls. Moreover, hormonal and antioxidant adaptations are also confirmed after HIRT intervention."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

At present, its pathogenesis has not been fully understood. Various methods are used for clinical treatment and intervention, among which physical activity (PA) intervention also has an obvious effect. This study has used bibliometric methods and visual analysis methods to analyze 885 studies of PA intervention in ASD from 2003 to 2022 in the Web of Science (WoS) database in order to provide theoretical support for the follow-up research on the effect of PA with ASD. The main findings of this study are as follows. First, the literature on PA interventions in ASD research showed a growing trend. The leading institution in this field is the University of Delaware, forming a core group of authors represented by authors such as Sean Healy and Carol Curtin et al. Second, the research focus of this research area mainly includes PA interventions for children and adolescents with ASD. PA can improve symptoms such as stereotyped behaviors and motor function in patients with ASD as well as can reduce childhood obesity rates and improve quality of life. Third, skill, youth, prevalence, and meta-analysis systematic reviews were found. It is the long-term concern and focus of researchers. In conclusion, the current research is only a short-term analysis, and it is not possible to verify the long-term effect; thus, future data analysis should evaluate and explore the long-term effects of PA interventions on ASD including cohort and longitudinal study types focused on the rehabilitation of patients with ASD. Moreover, testing the sustainability of benefits for children with ASD and constructing a multidimensional exercise integrated intervention model are the main directions for future research in this field."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The aim of this study was to present the applied method of observation, developed by Professor Wu Huanqun and modified by the authors, together with an assessment of its reliability. The method consists in observing the winning actions of a given player and the same actions of his opponent in parallel, on three levels of complexity. Levels 1, 2, and 3 are concerned with identifying increasingly detailed winning strokes and stroke combinations. To assess the reliability of the method, seven experts independently analyzed the men’s final game of the World Championship 2019. Kendall’s coefficient of concordance, with an χ2 significance test, was used to assess the compliance of the experts. Cronbach’s alpha was used to assess internal consistency. The obtained results indicate the high compliance and internal consistency (thus, high reliability) of the assessed method: the highest at the Level 1 observation level and the smallest, but significant, at Level 3. The performed statistical analysis indicates a high agreement between the experts’ opinions, which was taken as a measure of high reliability for the described method of observation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Developmental consequences related to back-carrying practices have not been directly investigated. This study determined the relationship between frontal and transverse plane lower limb (LL) development, and back-carrying practices, in black Setswana-speaking children. In 691 2- to 9-year-old Setswana-speaking children, the tibiofemoral angle, intermalleolar distance, femoral anteversion angle (AVA) and tibial torsion angle (TTA), were measured to determine LL development. Back-carrying practices were recorded with a questionnaire and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) was used for the analyses. Significant (p < 0.001) relationships, between back-carrying practices and LL development, were discovered. Statistically significant greater genu valgum (F(5, 690) = 7.2, p < 0.001), greater internal TTAs (F(9, 684) = 17.8, p < 0.001), and smaller AVAs (F(13, 685) = 5.1, p < 0.001) were observed in children back-carried more frequently than children back-carried less frequently. There are relationships between back-carrying practices and LL development in both the frontal and transverse plane.

Subjects: White-collar workers (n= 139), both women (n = 51) and men (n = 88) were separated into a control group (n = 82) and a low-intensity LBP (NRS < 3) (n = 57). Methods: The PPTs were tested utilizing the Wagner algometer. The curvatures of the spine were measured employing the photogrammetric method. In the logistic regression model, the odds ratio (OR) was estimated with ±95% confidence interval (CI) indicating the probability of the reported LBP. Results: The PPTs of soft tissue (OR = 1.1; CI = 1.02–1.19; p < 0.05) and the angle of the thoracolumbar spine in the everyday, habitual sitting position (OR = 1.19; CI = 1.05–1.34; p < 0.05) were associated with low-intensity LBP in female subjects. Additionally, the low intensity LBP were associated with the angles of the torso (OR = 1.14; CI = 1.01–1.29; p < 0.05) and the lumbosacral spine in the corrected sitting position (OR = 1.06; CI = 0.98–1.15; p > 0.05) and BMI (OR = 1.56; CI = 0.84–2.90; p > 0.05) in male subjects. Conclusion: Individual risk factors were associated with the low-intensity LBP only in females utilizing the PPT and the thoracolumbar angle in the habitual sitting position study factors. Men from the LBP group did not effectively correct the lumbosacral angle. Therefore, re-educated, self-corrected posture with specific postural training would be expected to improve proprioception in postural control capacity and result in decreasing pain."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Finola","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Recently, a series of papers reported preparation and physicochemical properties of various kinds of water treated in contact with various gases with low-temperature, low-pressure glow plasma of low frequency (LPGP). Consecutive papers presented results of watering numerous herbal plants with those kinds of water in planting of numerous herbal plants. Always, the watering influenced the yield and quality of the crops and considerably changed the composition of the essential oils extracted from the watered plants. This paper provides the effects of watering of Cannabis sativum var. Finola with water LPGP-treated either in the air (LPGPA), under molecular nitrogen (LPGPN) or carbon dioxide (LPGPC). Cannabis sativa, particularly its botanic class called hemp, attracts great attention for its numerous applications. They include rope, textiles, clothing, shoes, food, paper, bioplastics, insulation, biofuel and industrial fibre. The watering was maintained for 12 weeks. Regardless of the kind of the used plasma-treated water, a considerable increase in the plant crop yield was noted for first 7 weeks. Further cultivation resulted in a minute increase in the yield. The watering with LPGPC offered the highest crop yield, followed by nontreated water, LPGPN and LPGPA. The yield of essential oil per 1 g of plant was independent of the used kind of plasma-treated water. Watering Finola with LPGPA resulted in a decrease in the level of cannabidivarin (CBD V) and considerable increase in the deal of Δ 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC). The levels of the remaining components of the essential oil slightly decreased with respect to that in the control sample. Almost identical trends in the influence of watering upon the composition of essential oil were observed in the case of LPGPN. However, an unusually strong decrease in the level of CBD V accompanied by a very high increase in the level of Δ9-THC could be noted. The performed study provided strong evidence that watering seeds and plants of Finola with various kinds of the LPGP-treated water could modulate and even tailor the crop yield, functional properties of the plant and essential oils extracted from it. The composition of the essential oil isolated from the plant watered with LPGPN suggests its application as a substitute of medical marijuana (medical cannabis)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Thirty-eight swimmers performed starts changing the back plate position (preferred position, one position forward and one position backward), with the data being assessed using a 3D dynamometric central and a video camera. In males, the 15 m start time was 0.1 s shorter for the preferred position compared with the backward position (p < 0.05). Regardless of the back plate positioning, the swimmers spent a similar time on the block. A more forward position of the back plate postponed the rear foot take-off and consequently reduced the front foot stand duration. A back plate position effect was revealed for those variables with a larger effect size in males whereas in females, a change of about two positions was needed to reach a significance level. Probably due to the specification of physical domains, a greater impact on the changes introduced was noted for males. Therefore, whilst searching for the optimal starting position, adjustments to the back plate placement might affect a greater number of males than females. To reinforce the starting optimization during the training process and its monitoring, the effect of personal preference toward the starting block setting was also considered."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The measured parameters were body fat % (BFP), resting systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and fitness index (FI). The results indicate that positive HIIT-induced changes in SBP, DBP, and FI were most common among boys, especially those with low body mass index.

People with SCI face a variety of secondary conditions (e.g., chronic pain, urinary tract infections, cognitive impairment) that place a significant emotional burden, resulting in an increased risk of depression and reduced quality of life. The purpose of this study was to better understand the coping strategies and to identify factors that promote or hinder the successful adjustment of elite athletes after SCI. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight top athletes after spinal cord injury. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and then thematically analyzed using MAXQDA software. Thematic analysis identified the following categories: coping, athletic identity, and adjustment. The results of the study indicate that loss of functional ability does not cause loss of athlete identity. Elite athletes live a life consistent with this identity, attempting to maintain it despite the loss of physical fitness. Involvement in sports provides meaning and is a positive factor in the process of disability acceptance, which is essential in the process of adjustment to injury and also provides group belonging."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

An appropriately early diagnosis of adverse changes in skeletal muscles can reduce the risk of functional limitations in elderly persons. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between the appendicular skeletal muscle mass and quality, estimated by the bioelectrical impedance analysis method, and the risk of prevalence of the pre-frailty state in elderly persons.\n\nMethods\nOne-thousand-and-fifteen subjectively healthy persons aged 60–87 years were tested. Anthropometric measurements and physical fitness and activity measurements were carried out and the frailty phenotype was evaluated. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass was estimated using the bioelectrical impedance analysis method. Muscle quality was assessed through an index correcting strength relative to muscle mass and through the impedance phase angle. The correlation between the muscle mass and quality estimating parameters and the probability of identifying pre-frailty was checked using multiple logistic regression.\n\nResults\nThe prevalence of pre-frailty was 38%. The pre-frail persons were found to have a significantly lower muscle mass and quality than the non-frail persons, with the difference in the case of the muscle quality index nearly twice larger than for the muscle mass index. A significant logit model was obtained for pre-frailty prevalence, which was strongly dependent on the appendicular skeletal muscle mass (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 0.43, 95% CI 0.36–0.52, p < 0.001) and functional quality (adjusted OR: 0.26, 95% CI 0.18–0.38, p < 0.001) and less on age (adjusted OR: 1.10, 95% CI 1.07–1.13, p < 0.001).\n\nConclusion\nThe strong correlation between the frailty phenotype and appendicular skeletal muscle mass and functional quality suggests that the two variables should be included in routine geriatric assessment with regard to frailty."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Paralympic powerlifting (PP) training is typically intense and causes fatigue and alterations in the immune system. Objective: To analyze whether IBU would affect performance and the immune system after training in PP. Methodology: 10 athletes at the national level (NL) and 10 at the regional level (RL) participated in the study, where force and blood indicators were evaluated after training. The study took place over three weeks: (1) familiarization and (2 and 3) comparison between recovery methods, with ibuprofen or placebo (IBU vs. PLA), 800 mg. In the evaluation of the force, the peak torque (PT), fatigue index (FI), and blood immune system biomarkers were analyzed. The training consisted of five sets of five repetitions with 80% of one maximum repetition (5 × 5, 80% 1RM) on the bench press. Results: The PT at the national level using IBU was higher than with PLA (p = 0.007, η2p = 0.347), and the FI in the NL was lower with IBU than with PLA (p = 0.002, η2p = 0.635), and when comparing the use of IBU, the NL showed less fatigue than the regional level (p = 0.004, η2p = 0.414). Leukocytes, with the use of IBU in the NL group, were greater than in the RL (p = 0.001, η2p = 0.329). Neutrophils, in the NL with IBU, were greater than in the RL with IBU and PLA (p = 0.025, η2p = 0.444). Lymphocytes, in NL with IBU were lower than in RL with IBU and PLA (p = 0.001, η2p = 0.491). Monocytes, in the NL with IBU and PLA, were lower than in the RL with IBU (p = 0.049, η2p = 0.344). For hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte, the NL with IBU and PLA were higher than the RL with IBU and PLA (p < 0.05). Ammonia, with the use of IBU in the NL, obtained values higher than in the RL (p = 0.007), and with the use of PLA, the NL was higher than the RL (p = 0.038, η2p = 0.570). Conclusion: The training level tends to influence the immune system and, combined with the use of the IBU, it tends to improve recovery and the immune system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

In the absence of both verbal and motor communication, tests commonly used to assess cognitive function are completely or partially undoable for disorders of consciousness patients. The study involved 12 patients with varying degrees of impaired consciousness due to brain damage, with no verbal and motor communication. Memory was assessed in study participants using oculography. Memory tasks were presented in four categories. The total percentage of correctly completed tasks obtained across the group was 39.58%. The most difficult tasks included category C.4 with tasks involving working memory. Regardless of the subjects' level of consciousness, there was no statistically significant difference in the percentage of correct responses obtained in subgroups distinguished by CRS-R score. Eye tracking technology can be successfully used in the assessment of cognitive function, particularly when eye movements are the only channel of communication in individuals after brain damage. We suggest that the cognitive functions of people after brain damage should be further analyzed using eye tracking."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The aim of this research is the personality traits profiles of athletes training combat sport and team sport at the level of the Polish representation of juniors and seniors.\n\nMaterial and Methods: The subjects of the study were members of the Polish junior and senior national teams in Olympic karate (n = 41) and handball (n = 39) from the 2020/2021 season. We based our comparative analysis on the Five-Factor Model of Personality, known as the Big Five, was used to measure personality. The NEO-FFI Personality Questionnaire was used as the research tool. The study was conducted electronically. Statistical analyses were performed using the Microsoft Excel methods package.\n\nResults: The Polish national junior and senior Olympic karate team sportsmen do not differ in personality (their profiles are identical and average level in all dimensions). Likewise, players of the Polish junior and senior handball teams do not differ in personality. However, their profiles are similar - the seniors are distinguished only by a high level of extraversion. Moreover, when comparing the personality of Olympic karate juniors and seniors (combat sport) with that of handball juniors and seniors (team sport), no statistically significant differences were found in the raw test results.\n\nConclusions: The researched population of athletes, personality was probability formed at the junior level and remained unchanged at the senior level, apart from motor skills, technical-tactical skills, and sports experience that developed with age. Such a conclusion is valid on the assumption that seniors, when they were juniors, did not differ in personality traits from the young athletes we studied."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Health is the physiologically correct functioning of systems and organs, and the ability to maintain it is an active process involving distinct adaptive mechanisms that coordinate interactions between the body's systems and organs. Homeostasis is the body's ability to maintain health and the proper functioning of the body in the face of changing external or internal factors. One is the human microbiome, which is made up of microbes that make up a biocenosis, which can vary from person to person. Various types of microflora inhabit the human skin, mouth, nose and intestines, playing a role in the immune system and human metabolism. The literature review shows the relationship between the human microbiome and nutritional needs, metabolic rate and other measures of health.

Epide miological data on the prevalence and anatomical locations of injuries, type of injury, gender of the injured athletes, and causes of injury were collected. Method: Between 2009 and 2016, there were 28 top senior and junior tournaments ( Polish Cups, Polish Open Cups, Polish Championships). The students of the University School of Physical Education in Wroclaw, together with the local physician in charge, they filled in the EJU Injury Registration Form. This form registers the judoka’s sex and weight category, anatomical loca tion and the type of injury, the tissue involved, the side of the lesion, and whether the athlete is able to take part in the competition or needs hospitalization. Results: Between 2009-2016, 101 injuries occurred in 2,985 competitors during 28 top-level competitions. It means that 3.4% of all competitors needed medical assistance. Injuries of the knees (16.8%), shoulders (13.8%), and elbows (12.9%) were most common. Sprains (43.6%) were by far the most frequent type of injury, followed by contusions (22.8%). Of all competitors, 0.4% suffered injuries which needed hospitalization. No statistically significant differences in the incidence of individual types of injuries were found between male and female participants. Furthermore, significantly more elbow injuries were noted in women (p<0.01). Conclusion: During the registration period an injury incidence of only 3,4% was registered. An ongoing injury registration can help prevent injuries in judo competitors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The mechanism of injury in judo is related to the throwing technique and wrestling. According to some studies, injuries most often concern the upper limbs, as the fight begins with putting up both judokas. The right-hand or left-hand stance is a constant in every wrestler's sporting career that expresses the individual characteristics of the lateral organization of the brain . Some of the possible causes of upper limb injuries in sambists and judokas were analyzed in this paper. An attempt was made to find a relationship between the injuries suffered and the athletes' lateral preferences. Materiał i metody. 32 sambists and judokas of various qualifications from upper limb inju­ries were examined (shoulder joint – 50%, elbow joint – 47%, both – 3%). Data was obtained on the nature of the injury, side preferences and the main technical activities of the athletes. The study did not take into account differences in sex, age and weight category. Results. All athletes reported having received either surgery (34%) or conservative (66%) treatment. According to the respondents, the main causes of injury were overtraining (31%), fatigue (28%), weakening of ligaments and / or muscles (28%), and the rude of the enemy (22%). To a lesser extent these include poor warm-up (16%), weight reduction (3%) and low logistics (6%). Conclusions. The study revealed no statistically significant relationship between the applied technique and LBP. As a consequence, athletes with right-sided posture more often sustained injuries of the right limb, and those with left-sided stance more often reported injuries of the left limb. Here, ground damage is eliminated as the lateral preference is less pronounced in this case."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

It participates in the regulation of energy processes in the body through central and peripheral mechanisms. The aim of this study was to analyse the anthropological and physical performance changes during 9 month training in women of different age and body mass. The additional aim was the analysis of leptin levels in the fasting stage and after a control exercise. Obese (O), overweight (OW), and normal-weight (N) women participated in the study. Additional subgroups of premenopausal (PRE) (<50 years) and postmenopausal (POST) (50+) women were created for leptin level analysis. The main criterion of the division into subgroups was the age of menopause in the population. The control submaximal test and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) according to Astrand–Rhyming procedures was performed at baseline and after 3, 6, and 9 months. Before each control test, body weight (BM), body mass index (BMI), percentage of adipose tissue (% FAT), and mass (FAT (kg)) were measured. Moreover, before and after each test, leptin level was measured. After 9 months, there was a significant decrease in BM in the O (p < 0.05) and OW (p < 0.05) groups with no significant changes in the N group. There was a decrease in BMI in both the O (p < 0.05) and the OW (p < 0.05) groups, with no changes in the N group. The % FAT reduction was noted only in the O group (p < 0.05). VO2max increased in each of the measured groups (p < 0.05). The fasting leptin level at 0, 3, 6, and 9 months were the highest in the O group. The fasting leptin level before training was highest in the O group compared to the OW group (p < 0.01) and the N group (p < 0.01). It was also higher in the OW group compared to the N group at baseline (0) (p < 0.01) and after 3 and 6 months (p < 0.01). After 9 months, the leptin concentration decreased by 20.2% in the O group, 40.7% in the OW group, and 33% in the N group. Moreover, the fasting leptin level was higher in the POST subgroup compared to the PRE group in the whole group of women (p < 0.05). After a single exercise, the level of leptin in the whole study group decreased (p < 0.05). This was clearly seen, especially in the POST group.

The aim of the paper was to verify the opinions of kyokushin karatekas on mental training.\n\nMaterial and Methods: The Polish representation of juniors and seniors in karate kyokushin (n = 48) from the 2021/2022 season took part in the study. The average training experience in the entire sample of respondents was 12.7 years. Three people are kata competitors and 45 people are kumite competitors. A diagnostic survey method was used, and for this purpose the authors’ own questionnaire was used.\n\nResults: The investigated athletes pay a significant role to mental preparation: they cooperate with sports psychologists and mental trainers; some of them also carry out their own mental training.  Standard methods of mental preparation as well as meditation and wakefulness are used by the surveyed karatekas. These methods help to reduce the level of stress, which some of them experience before the competition day, while others experience stress on the day of the competition. The training level of their opponents does not affect their stress level.\n\nConclusions: For the studied athletes, mental training is very important. Karatekas cooperate with specialists, and also independently undertake mental exercises from the karate culture array. Practising mental training by karatekas reduces their stress level. Most of them experience stress only on the competition day, and this stress is related only to the starting situation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The study consisted of three stages: desk research, a diagnostic survey, as well as qualitative, and statistical analyses. Empirical data from all 16 Polish RTOs (regional DMOs) on 19 variables were collected. No significant symptoms of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the functional relationship between RTOs and their stakeholders were found, except for the observed increased number of limitations of RTOs’ activities aimed at benefiting their members. As part of the study’s secondary objectives, key variables and methods were indicated. They identify the functional relationships of RTOs with member entities, with the environment, and are useful in building the effectiveness of the organization at the regional level in crisis situations. As the pragmatic goal of the study, a research tool was proposed that can be implemented to evaluate relations with the environment in other tourism destination management organizations at various levels of the tourism economy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Methods: A total of 141 boys and girls (16 years) were examined as control (CG) and experimental (EG) groups that conducted a 10-week HIIT implemented in physical education. Measurements: body height, body weight, fat mass index (FMI), CRF (Harvard Step Test). Predicted age at peak height velocity (APHV) was calculated. Pathway analyses were conducted to identify the influences of the measured variables. Results: APHV harmed the level of ΔFI (fitness index) (β = −0.270; p = 0.035), while HIIT had a positive effect on changes in ΔFI (β = 0.246; p = 0.002). Sex affected the changes in CRF (β = 0.344; p = 0.011). Two models were designed respective to sex. The effect of the APHV on ΔFI in girls was close to significant (p = 0.053) but was non-significant in boys (p = 0.311). Changes in CRF in girls were positively and close to significance (p < 0.100) affected by FMIbaseline.

Bingocize® was created as an intervention to not only attract older individuals but to retain their attention by utilizing a fun, interactive game to allow for the exercise of the body and mind (Crandall, et al 2011). Bingocize® allows individuals to be more social, which has proved to increase one’s lifespan (WHO, 2018), to become more physically active, and to exercise the mind. These all are important components of one’s longevity. The cognitive function is exercised by use of health-related questions incorporated into the Bingocize® game. The game also includes physical exercises for adults to increase balance, strength, muscle tone, and coordination. The increase in physical fitness will allow older adults to combat the natural process of aging where there is a natural degeneration of muscles and cognitive functioning. By continuing to exercise these parts, we are able to live longer, and healthier lives (Crandall et al. 2015). Aim of the Study: The aim of the study was to determine if Bingocize® (a mobile app-based social game) after a 12 week program was an effective tool for improving physical fitness and lowering body weight in Older adults in Krakow, Poland. Materials and Methods: Older adults attending the Krakow, Poland Senior Center (N=36; age 72.41 +9.23) were recruited and randomly assigned to (a) experimental (n=19; social game with exercise) or (b) control (n=17 no exercise) condition. Pre/post measures used in the 12 week intervention were: body weight, physical fitness (using Senior Fitness Test composed of 6 trials). Statistical analysis included a mixed-model ANOVA (p < .05). Results: Significant differences were observed in subgroups (pre/post) for body weight, chair stand, arm curl, and step test in both experimental and control group. Significant differences were observed in subgroups (pre/post) in experimental only for chair sit and reach, 8ft up and go, and back scratch.

This study investigated the musculoskeletal injury risk due to static balance and movement quality regarding single and multiple injury occurrences in physically active women. Methods: The study sample was 88 women aged 21.48 ± 1.56. The injury data were obtained with a questionnaire, and Deep Squat (DS), In-line lunge (IL), and Hurdle Step (HS) tests were conducted. Static balance was assessed with a stabilometric platform measured center of gravity area circle (AC) and path length (PL) with open (OE) and closed eyes (CE), maintaining a standing position for the 30 s. Results: The logistic regression models revealed the general injury occurrence was predicted by AC-CE (OR = 0.70; p = 0.03) and IL (OR = 0.49; p = 0.03), and the two-factor model AC-CE*IL, (OR = 1.40; p < 0.01). When the single injury was predicted by the same factors AC-CE (OR = 0.49; p < 0.01), IL (OR = 0.36; p = 0.01), and AC-CE*IL (OR = 1.58; p < 0.01). Conclusion: Static balance and movement stability predict musculoskeletal injury risk alone and in one model. A further study is needed to verify the efficiency of indicated factors in prospective terms. Using both quantitative and qualitative tests could be helpful in IR prediction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Material and Methods: Thirty-eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with MNU and were divided into three groups, i.e., sedentary control (SC), the group of moderate-intensity training (MIT) and the group of high-intensity training (HIT). Physical training was supervised immediately after MNU administration and was conducted 5 days per week for 12 weeks on a three-position treadmill. Results: A significant difference was found between SC and training groups in terms of the number of induced tumors per rat (1.57 vs. 0.4, p = 0.05) and in the following lymphocyte subpopulations: CD4+/CD8+ (p = 0.01), CD3−/CD11b+ (p = 0.02), CD3−/CD161+ (p = 0.002), CD3−/CD161− (p = 0.002), CD3+/CD45RA+ (p = 0.003) and CD3−/CD45RA+ (p = 0.005).

The male national team of Ukraine in karate kyokushin (N = 7) participated in the personality study with the use of the Big Five model. The NEO-FFI (NEO Five-Factor Inventory) Personality Questionnaire was applied as a research tool and the package of statistical methods IBM SPSS Statistics 27.0 (IBM Polska, Warszawa, Poland) was used to compute the research results. The study showed that there were differences in the intensity of openness to experiences between individual samples only at the level of the statistical trend. Masters showed a higher level of openness to experiences in relation to juniors (p = 0.081) and seniors (p = 0.097). Also, a negative and strong correlation between the intensity of neuroticism and conscientiousness among the respondents was noted. A conclusion was drawn that, with age, karatekas probably manifest greater openness to experience, which is the result of their sports experience, high sports level and pro-health values of karate. On the other hand, good emotional adaptation of karatekas is strictly related to conscientiousness."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This research aimed to explore the developmental changes in GMC during childhood, having controlled for the differences in children’s body size and shape using a longitudinal, allometric scaling methodology.\n\nMethods\nA total of 104 children from North-East Italy of third-fourth- and fifth-grade students and each participant were tested for three consequently years. Subjects performed the short version of korperkoordinationstest fur kinder (KTK3) and the anthropometric characteristics were simultaneously collected. The physical activity questionnaire (PAQ-C) was used to evaluate the weekly physical engagement.\n\nResults\nOntogenetic multiplicative models suggested nonlinear associations with GMC across the children’s developmental years. Linear physique was a significant predictor associated with the development of GMC across time. PAQ-C was significantly associated with GMC from 8 to 13 years old.\n\nConclusion\nGrowth does not respect linear trends. A greater lean body mass could be assessed as a reliable predictor of GMC in children. The crucial period of life to improve the GMC is 8–10 years, while stabilization becomes evident from 10 to 13 years.\n"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

However, it is unclear whether a high torque ratio of the knee joint flexor muscles to the extensor muscles is beneficial for sport performance. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between the hamstring-to-quadriceps (H/Q) ratio and sprint times (10- and 30-m) and jump heights (CMJ—countermovement jump and SJ—squat jump) in soccer players. The study examined 26 young elite soccer players (age: 18.1 ± 0.7 years; body height: 1.77 ± 0.05 m; body mass: 72.7 ± 5.7 kg). Knee joint flexor and extensor peak torques were assessed using the Cybex dynamometer (at 60°/s, 120°/s and 180°/s). Additionally, each participant performed the CMJ, SJ, and 30 m sprint. A significant relationship was obtained between the H/Q ratio (60°/s) and 30 m sprint time (r = 0.47). The positive direction of this relationship may indicate an important role of knee joint extensors in sprinting performance.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of blood lead levels on handgrip strength (HGS) in urban children resident in the Copper Basin of Lower Silesia, Poland, controlling for the effects of chronological age, body size and socioeconomic status. The study included 165 boys (9–11 years of age) and 79 girls (9–10 years of age) from Polkowice town. Anthropometric measurements involved height, body mass and grip strength of the left and right hands. Maternal education was a proxy for socioeconomic status. Based on the median value of blood lead level (3.10 µg/dL), the two groups-below and above/equal median value-were defined. Analysis of covariance revealed that age (all p < 0.001), sex (at least p < 0.01), BMI (all p < 0.001), and blood lead level (at least p < 0.05) had a significant effect on the three indicators of HGS (right hand, left hand, average), while the level of maternal education did not significantly affect HGS (p > 0.05). The results of this study indicate a potentially negative effect of elevated blood lead level on grip strength in preadolescent children, irrespective of sex."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

When the handball team lost the game, an increment in the network density in relation to the draw and win scenario was observed (η2 = 1.00; p = 0.01). It was observed that closeness centrality and network density increased when the team had lost and played at home, while when the team was playing away from home and losing, closeness centrality decreased (η2 = 0.99; p = 0.01).\nConclusions:\nIn conclusion, contextual variables impact the way that handball players interact during a match."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The participants were 141 adolescents aged 16 years. Independent variables were body mass index (BMI), fat mass index (FMI), muscle mass index (SMI), and mass to fat ratio (MFR); dependent variables were systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) and its indices: pulse pressure (PP), mid-blood pressure (MBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The receiver operating curve (ROC) method was employed. SMI and MFR are body composition indices with prognostic potential to predict positive changes in SBP in males (SMI: AUC = 0.82; p < 0.001, MFR = 0.70; p = 0.039) and MFR in females (AUC = 0.72; p = 0.035). The respective cut-off point values used to classify participants as a beneficiary of HIIT intervention concerning SBP were SMI = 7.84 and MFR = 2.43 in males, and for SMI = 10.12 and MFR = 1.94 in females. Body composition indices based on skeletal muscle (SMI, MFR) were more likely to predict positive changes in SBP after HIIT intervention in adolescents. PP, MBP, and MAP did not reflect the detecting power of SMI and MFR. However, these thresholds’ utility is limited to adolescents of 16 years of age."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to review and conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the differences in visual search behavior between experts and novices in team sports athletes.\n\nMethods: This systematic review with meta-analysis followed the PRISMA 2020 and Cochrane's guidelines. Healthy team athletes were included, which engaged in regular practice, from any sex or competitive level, specifically classified a priori as expert or novice in the original research (i.e., if they were classified after the experiment, based on one of the tests, the study would be excluded). We considered only research published in peer-reviewed journals, with no limitations regarding date or language. It was considered healthy team sport athletes engaged in regular practice. The scenarios could be in situ or film-based. The databases of EBSCO (Academic Search Complete, Academic Search Ultimate, APA PsycArticles, and APA PsycINFO), PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science were used to perform the searches. The risk of bias was calculated through the RoBANS tool.\n\nResults: From a total of 6,257 records, of which 985 were duplicates, titles and abstracts of 5,272 were screened, and 45 required full-text analysis. Of those, 23 were excluded due to not fulfilling the eligibility criteria regarding participants. In the end, 22 studies were selected, however, as two studies were part of the same trial and were analyzed conjointly.\n\nDiscussion: Experts showed to be older and with more years of practice. The ability to distinguish experts from novices was not so clear regarding the variables analyzed. This could be due to the strategies chosen in each study, which were specific to each scenario, and when grouping all together, it was lost information within non-representative averages. The distinction between experts and novices was not clear, showing a lot of heterogeneity in the included studies. The expert classification itself may have been the conditioning aspect for these results, retaining the doubt and the need for more studies in the field.\n\nSystematic review registration: The protocol was pre-registered in OSF (project https://osf.io/3j4qv/, register https://osf.io/dvk2n)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Types of training sessions: (1) sprint interval training (SIT) which consisted of 8–16, 30 s repetitions at maximal intensity, (2) high-intensity interval training (HIIT) included 5 to 7, 5-min efforts at an intensity of 85–95% maximal aerobic power (Pmax), and (3) endurance training (ET) performed at an intensity of 55–60% Pmax, lasting 120–-180 min. In each week the cyclists performed: in group E a polarized training program, which included 2 × SIT, 1 × HIIT and 2 × ET, while in group C 2 × HIIT and 3 × ET. Before (acute effects) and after the 9-week training period (chronic effects) participants performed laboratory sprint interval testing protocol (SITP), which consisted of 12 maximal repetitions lasting 30 s. During SITP maximal and mean anaerobic power, as well as lactate ion concentration and blood pH were measured. Choice reaction time (RT) was measured 4-times: before and immediately after the SITP test—before and after the 9-week training period. Evaluated the average choice RT, minimal choice RT (shortest reaction), maximal choice RT (longest reaction), and the number of incorrect reactions. Before the training period as acute effects of SITP, it was observed: a shorter average choice RT (F = 13.61; p = 0.001; η2 = 0.362) and maximal choice RT (F = 4.71; p = 0.040; η2 = 0.164), and a decrease the number of incorrect reactions (F = 53.72; p = 0.000; η2 = 0.691), for E and C groups. After the 9-week training period, chronic effects showed that choice RT did not change in any of the cyclists' groups. Only in the E group after the polarized training period, the number of incorrect reactions decreased (F = 49.03; p = 0.000; η2 = 0.671), average anaerobic power increased (F = 8.70; p = 0.007; η2 = 0.274) and blood pH decreased (F = 27.20; p = 0.000; η2 = 0.531), compared to the value before the training period. In conclusion, a shorter choice RT and a decrease in the number of incorrect reactions as acute effects of SITP, and a decrease in the number of incorrect reactions and higher average power as chronic effects of the polarized training program are beneficial for mountain bike cyclists."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Each subject performed an incremental test and, after a 48-h interval, a 110%Pmax power test combined with an analysis of the thermal parameters, heart rate recovery and heart rate variability. Thermal radiation density from the body surface (temple) was measured using a Sonel KT384 thermal imaging camera immediately after warm-up (Tb), immediately after exercise (Te) and 120 sec after the end of exercise (Tr). The differences between measurements were then calculated. The correlation analysis between the thermal and cardiovascular function parameters during the recovery period showed strong positive associations between the Tr-Te difference and measures of cardiovascular fitness (50 < r < 69, p < 0.05). For example, the correlation coefficient between Tr-Te and VO2max reached 0.55 and between Tr-Te and Pmax reached 0.68.

The study group consisted of 26 women aged 19–24. The correct functioning of the ther-moregulation system was determined by means of cold pressor and orthostatic tests. The subjects underwent short-wave diathermy treatment in the area of the right knee joint, and the body’s response was determined by thermovision using a ThermaCAM P640 thermal imaging camera manufactured by FLIR. Curves were recorded in a digital form (images with a resolution of 640 ×   480 pixels) and analyzed with ThermaCAM ReporterTM software. In people with a properly func-tioning thermoregulation system, the short-wave diathermy treatment statistically significantly increased the body surface temperature on the posterior surface of the knee joint. On the front side, the surface temperature decreased. There were no changes in surface temperature in the other areas of the body studied. The results of thermal imaging studies confirmed the local nature of the action of short-wave diathermy. The recommendation to use a physical procedure should be preceded by an assessment of the body’s thermoregulation system level of function. Reactions to the prescribed physical treatment may be different in people with a disturbed autonomic system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The aim of the research was the knowledge about relationship between a club’s position in the league and the personality of Wrocław football players at the junior and pre-junior level.\nMaterial and Methods: Players from Wrocław (n = 103) of the 1st Lower Silesian Provincial League A1 Junior (U-19) and B1 Younger Junior (U-17) participated in the personality study with the use of the Big Five model. The NEO-FFI Personality Questionnaire was used as the research tool. The research took into account the positions of the clubs in the league understood as the final result of the competition in the 2020/2021 season. The analyses were performed with the statistical methods package IBM SPSS Statistics, version 26. The following tests were applied: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Levene’s, ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni corrections. The statistical power analysis was performed using the G*Power program, version 3.1.9.7.\nResults: Differences in the intensity of neuroticism were noted between the players of the U-19 clubs, with the footballers from the 3rd position showing the highest emotional balance. In the U-17 group, no differences were found between the players of the concerned clubs. No differences were also found between players of the U-19 and U-17 clubs.\nConclusions: It was concluded that a better club position in the league is not related to a personality of Wrocław football players at the junior and youth stages that is preferred by the coaches. The personality traits of young footballers are at similar levels.

Engaging in exercise and sports during the RFP leads to the lipolysis of adipose tissue and an increase in the breakdown of peripheral fat, leading to an increase in fat consumption. The effects of the RFP on functional, hematological, and metabolic parameters needs further study as existing studies have reported contradictory results. The differences in the results of various studies are due to the geographical characteristics of Muslim athletes, their specific diets, and their genetics, which explain these variations. In recent years, the attention of medical and sports researchers on the effects of the RFP and energy restrictions on bodily functions and athletic performance has increased significantly. Therefore, this brief article examines the effects of the RFP on the immune system, body composition, hematology, and the functionality of athletes during and after the RFP. We found that most sporting activities were performed during any time of the day without being affected by Ramadan fasting. Athletes were able to participate in their physical activities during fasting periods and saw few effects on their performance. Sleep and nutritional factors should be adjusted so that athletic performance is not impaired."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

It affects both the social and economic areas, therefore it has been considered a lifestyle disease for many years. Bone tissue is a dynamic structure exhibiting sensitivity to various stimuli, including mechanical ones, which are a regulator of tissue sclerostin levels. Sclerostin is a protein involved in bone remodeling, showing an anti-anabolic effect on bone density. Moderate to vigorous physical activity inhibits secretion of this protein and promotes increased bone mineral density. Appropriate exercise has been shown to have an osteogenic effect. The effectiveness of osteogenic training depends on the type, intensity, regularity and frequency of exercise and the number of body parts involved. The greatest osteogenic activity is demonstrated by exercises affecting bone with high ground reaction forces (GRF) and high forces exerted by contracting muscles (JFR). The purpose of this study was to review the literature for the effects of various forms of exercise on sclerostin secretion."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The study included 210 women with histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer and 225 women without a cancer diagnosis. Questionnaire data on frequency of intake of 40 different foods, the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire, and SF-36 for evaluation of quality of life were used. All questionnaire data in the patient group were collected after diagnosis. Questions about eating habits covered two time points—before breast cancer diagnosis and after completion of treatment. Logistic regression was applied to calculate the odds ratios of breast cancer risk and 95% confidence intervals. A significant positive association was found between the risk of breast cancer and more frequent intake of red meat, smoked products, offal, animal fat, white bread, potatoes, and sweets, high intake of total fat, and low consumption of dietary fibre. Foods that were inversely associated with the risk of breast cancer included fish, vegetables, fruit, wholemeal bread, and groats. The relationship between quality of life and dietary habits according to the Block Eating Frequency Questionnaire was analysed using multiple regression. It was shown that high intake of total fat reduces the quality of life in its mental components.

As many as 84% of mothers and 77% of fathers presented high level of perceived stress. Comparative analysis showed a statistically significant difference in anxiety and life satisfaction between the groups of mothers and fathers studied. Taking declared physical activity into account, there was a statistically significant difference in stress and anxiety in the mothers’ group and a statistically significant difference in mood and life satisfaction in the fathers’ group.

There are numerous methods for estimating the body fat percentage, however, all of those methods are different in terms of availability, accuracy, and the cost of an individual examination. The aim of this study was to compare two relatively easy and widespread measurement methods for assessing skinfold thickness: the BodyMetrix BX2000 ultrasound machine and a classic GPM caliper. Fifty-eight young women aged 19–24 years with normative body weight participated in the study. We found that although the measurements performed by both methods are positively correlated, the obtained values were different. In seven out of nine measured points, these differences were statistically significant. The measurements of skin fat folds with a caliper showed a higher value of subcutaneous tissue compared to ultrasound measurements. Only the values of measurements on the pectoral and mid-axillary did not differ between the methods. We conclude that due to the significant discrepancies in the values of measured skinfold thickness, appropriate measurement tools and dedicated formulas estimating the amount of body fat should be used."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The study evaluated 133 individuals (18–25 years old) who suffered from LDH and underwent MRI and flexion-extension X-rays. Two groups were created: protrusion (PRO) and extrusion (EXT). LSI was scored positive when translatory motion was greater than 4 mm anteriorly or 2 mm posteriorly at the level of herniation. Statistica 13 was used to perform statistics. The LSI overall prevalence was 18.33% in PRO and 21.92% in EXT (p > 0.05). Out of all LSI positives, higher LSI incidence was observed in females compared to males; in PRO: 63.64%; in EXT: 68.75% (p > 0.05). LSI correlated positively with the passive lumbar extension test (PLE) (R = 0.32; p = 0.01) in the PRO group only. In summary, the results showed that the overall incidence of LSI was higher with severer disc damage. In addition, females were more prone to this pathology.

Moreover, there is still a lack of effective and innovative methods of teaching this group of students. Here we investigate whether Eduball-based brain training stimulate reading and writing skills among students with dyslexia. Since our previous studies showed that integrating learning with physical activity (PA) by using educational balls with printed letters, numbers and other signs (i.e., Eduballs) is beneficial to healthy children, we hypothesize that this is also the case for children with reading disorder. Two groups of third-grade students of therapeutic primary school participated in our experiment: dyslexics with lower performance in reading and writing (experimental class) and higher performing ones (control class). The PA classes in the experimental group were based on Eduball-method. The control group followed a regular PA program. After one year, Eduball-group caught up with their better performing peers in terms of writing and reading skills. Therefore, our results demonstrate that Eduball is not only a method for regular learners, but also a promising form of brain training for lower performing dyslexic children. Combining Eduball-strategy with neurofeedback or non-invasive brain stimulation techniques may bring further therapeutic benefits."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The perspective of spatial differentiation and development of Olympic combat sports is the premise of this paper. The aim of the paper is an in-depth reflection on the phenomenon of the geography of the Olympic combat sports from the Far East – judo, karate and taekwondo.\nMaterial and Methods: Judo, karate and taekwondo results from the Olympic Games posted on the IOC website were analysed. For this purpose, the method of secondary source analysis was used. Two new indicators were then constructed to relativize the data: the Olympic Games medal winning frequency index (M); the Olympic Games points winning frequency index (P). A cartographic method – choropleth map and proportional symbol map – was used to illustrate the results. The natural interval method was used to determine class intervals.\nResults: Regarding the number of medals won, Japan dominates in judo, Turkey in karate and South Korea in taekwondo. However, regarding the weight of medals won, Japan dominates in both judo and karate, and South Korea in taekwondo. Unfortunately, Japan is not a member of CISM (Conseil International du Sport Militaire), and karate is not competitive at the highest level in this organization of athlete-soldiers.\nConclusions: The obtained results show the impact of geography on sport. The countries where judo, karate and taekwondo originated dominate the Olympic competition in these disciplines of Far Eastern combat sports."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Due to the specific nature of this competition, most probably a hypothesis is true that kumite athletes will have an athletic body build with a predominance of upper limbs. The aim of this study was to verify this hypothesis and the knowledge on the anthropometric predispositions of traditional karate competitors specializing in kumite.\nMaterial and Methods: Subjects (n = 30) are randomly selected, active Polish traditional karate competitors competing in kumite – senior female karatekas (n = 15) and senior male karatekas (n = 15), with dan master degrees, with a professional experience (national and international) of 4 years or more. The anthropometric method was used. The Rohrer Index of the subjects was calculated. Based on the data obtained, the Ape Index classification for karate players. Then the Ape Index of the tested persons was compared to the number of ranking points they obtained during the Poland season of 2021/2022. Basic descriptive statistics and Spearman’s rank correlation were performed, assuming a significance level α of 0.05.\nResults: Senior female karatekas are characterized by a leptosomic build type and symmetrical range of limbs. Senior male karatekas are characterized by a pyknic type of build with a positive Ape Index. In senior female karatekas, a correlation was observed between the Ape Index and the number of ranking points. Among the senior male karatekas, no correlation was observed between the Ape Index and the number of ranking points.\nConclusions: The hypothesis regarding the athletic built of athletes practicing traditional karate turned out to be false in relation to the researched sample.

Thorough analyses of the factors affecting EFs can aid in the development of appropriate training programs for various social and professional groups, including the military. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors affecting the EFs of cadets (18 women and 108 men) studying at a military academy in Poland after the first and second terms of military training, and to investigate gender differences in the level of EFs, shooting performance (SP), and components of physical fitness (PF). The Neuropsychological Color Trails Test (CTT-2) was used to determine some of the EFs of the test subjects. Meanwhile, the level of SP was represented by the score achieved during marksmanship training implemented during military training. Assessment of the subjects’ PF was guided by the principles of the Health-Related Fitness assessment concept, i.e., health-related fitness. Differences between men and women in specific variables were calculated using the Mann–Whitney U test for independent samples, whilst the relationship between variables was analyzed using the best subset regression method. The results revealed that cadets’ EFs were influenced by their SP and their level of strength. However, there were no significant differences between male and female cadets in the levels of EFs or SP."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"6152e0b72467f02da4b041cf","name":"Department of Physical Education and Sport, General Tadeusz Kosciuszko Military University of Land Forces","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63a42b2f40970710a6db11b4","5e709299878c28a047398bdf","5e70934d878c28a0473a6e1e"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The aim of this study is to identify the factors associated with undertaking health-promoting activities by older women at high risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) with or without depressive symptoms. Methods: The study group consisted of 70 older women (62–84 years old) undertaking regular physical activity. A self-developed questionnaire (used to determine the living situation, selected lifestyle components and health problems), the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were used. Results: In the study group undertaking regular physical activity, 40% had increased symptoms of depression (D group), and 60% were classified as non-depressed (ND group). The D group had a higher general stress level (t = −6.18, p = 0.001). Improving and/or maintaining physical fitness was identified as the greatest motivation in both groups. Willingness to spend time with other people significantly differed between the two groups (χ2 = 4.148, p = 0.042). The sole factor significantly differentiating between both groups was lack of time (χ2 = 8.777, p = 0.003). Conclusions: Motivations and barriers to undertaking health-promoting activities and levels of perceived stress were significantly different between the depressed and non-depressed groups. It is important to encourage primary care physicians to perform screening tests for late-life depression and to provide information on where therapeutic interventions are available for patients with symptoms of MetS and coexisting depressive symptoms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The aim of the study was the answer to the question: whether the fat patterns of combat sports athletes differ among disciplines.\nMaterial and Methods: Anthropometric measurements and body composition assessment of 390 combat sports athletes (boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu/BJJ, judo, karate, kick-boxing taekwondo, wrestling) were conducted. The body fat characteristics were determined based on skinfolds measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis and also subcutaneous fat indices.\nResults: The distribution of subcutaneous adipose tissue is similar in karate, taekwondo, judo and BJJ athletes, while the pattern of subcutaneous fat in boxers, kick-boxers and wrestlers differs slightly. Men practicing particular sports differ in limb to trunk subcutaneous fat proportion, as well as in total body fat. Kick-boxers have the highest proportion of subcutaneous fat, while judo and BJJ athletes have the lowest one. BJJ athletes are characterized by the greatest difference in subcutaneous fat distribution – limb fat is half that of the trunk. The distribution is more balanced in karate, kick-boxing and taekwondo athletes. In terms of total body fat content the wrestlers dominate, whereas judo and BJJ athletes had the lowest one.\nConclusions: Athletes representing various combat sports are characterized by different fat patterns. This became particularly apparent when the analysis simultaneously considered the thickness of the skinfolds in different parts of the body, the relative size of subcutaneous fat, and the percentage of total fat, as well as the distribution of subcutaneous fat on the limbs and torso."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

A  total  of  1,224  match  observations  from  professional  soccer  teams  competing  during two consecutive seasons in the German Bundesliga were analyzed. In addition, the final league ranking position and the total of points obtained by each team at the end of the season were registered for the analysis of the association between  team  success  and  match  running  performance.  The  main  findings  were  that  high  ranked  teams  covered  the  greatest total distance with ball possession, sprinting distance with ball possession, and completed the greatest number of sprinting actions with ball possession and maximal velocity. Moreover, total distance covered with possession of the ball  and  maximal  velocity  were  the  most  important  variables  to  predict  the  total  of  points  obtained  at  the  end  of  the  season. Specifically, the relative contribution of total distance covered with ball possession to the total of points obtained was greater than maximal velocity. Training programs for professional soccer players should be focused on improving the sprint capacity and running with possession of the ball (e.g., transitional tasks and small-sided games). Moreover, this has implications for injury prevention, physical, psychological, and technical-tactical training since today’s soccer requires  players  to  engage  in  repeated  high-intensity  actions,  reach  maximum  speeds  above  9  m/s,  and  develop  technical-tactical coordination when running with the ball."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The participants were tested at baseline and 5-min, 15-min, 30-min, 45-min, and 60-min after ROLL and FLOSS for Achilles tendon stiffness (ATstiffeness) at three reference locations: (1) tendon’s origin, (2) ankle joint height and (3) intermuscular septum of the gastronomies muscle; countermovement jump (CMJ); and sprint performance at 15-m (SPRINT15 m). The analysis of stiffness revealed a significant decrease in ATstiffness from baseline to Post-60 (p ≤ 0.001) for three locations in the FLOSS group (p ≤ 0.001). In FLOSS, a significant increase was observed from Post-15 to Post-60 (all p≤0.001) in CMJ. We found also a significant decrease in SPRINT15 m in FLOSS in all-time points (p ≤ 0.001), however, SPRINT15 m decreased in Post-5 min, Post-15 min, and Post-30 min (p ≤ 0.001 for all) in ROLL.

Digit ratio (2D:4D), being a putative indicator of prenatal testosterone, is associated in varying degrees with characters that show sexual dimorphism.

The objective of the present study was to ascertain whether 2D:4D in religiously oriented seminary students is different from individuals in other occupations. The study followed a cross-sectional design. Male participants of the study included 13 seminary students, 18 military chaplains and 91 control students from study courses relating to civil occupations. Lengths of second (2D) and fourth (4D) digits and their ratio (2D:4D) for each hand, height and weight were the variables and 2D:4D was the outcome measure. The results demonstrated that the seminary students had significantly higher 2D:4D than both the military chaplains and civil students. The military chaplains had the lowest 2D:4D. The study also revealed that the choice of religious occupation, and for that matter, religiosity, could be linked with the prenatal hormonal environment, particularly lower intrauterine testosterone compared to oestrogen."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

(3) Methods: PubMed, ScienceDirect and EBSCOhost databases were searched. We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the last 12 years using at least one of the NMT techniques from the sensorimotor, speech/language and cognitive domains in the therapy of patients over 60 years old and with psychogeriatric disorders. (4) Results: Of the 255 articles, 8 met the inclusion criteria. All papers in the final phase concerned the use of rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) (sensorimotor technique) in the rehabilitation of both Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients (six studies) and stroke patients (SPs) (two studies).

It was hypothesized that BH and BMI might be significantly associated with AG and CODS. Two scenarios of the Five-Time Shuttle Run to Gates test (planned and unplanned) were used to evaluate the CODS and AG. Two forms of models were built to assess functional forms of the relationships between CODS and AG vs. BH and BMI: simple linear regression and binomial curvilinear regression for each type of team sport. The results confirmed the relationships between both anthropometric measurements and motor abilities only in HB, whereas in BB only a significant relationship was noted between BH and AG. Moreover, two curvilinear functional forms of the relationship were identified: inverted L-shape and inverted U-shape. Therefore, it was concluded that the first form of function indicated an initially proportional relationship between anthropometric measurement and motor test results and plateau after reaching a certain value of the BH or BMI. Similarly, the second form of function indicated the peak value of the BH or BMI which is threshold for the value of the anthropometric measurement when a progressive effect in the functional feature occurs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This study included 12 volunteer male motorcycle speedway riders from the highest speedway league in Poland (PGE Speedway Ekstraliga) (age: 22.7 ± 6.0 years, body height: 171.3 ± 4.0 cm, body weight: 62.5 ± 3.1 kg). Before and after the competitive season, an assessment of body composition and Wingate test (WAnT) on a cycle ergometer with analysis of acute cardiorespiratory and biochemical responses was conducted. Sport level for all riders was defined by the number of heats won (WS), the total number of points scored in all heats including bonus points (PTS + B), and the percentage of heats won (%W). The motorcycle speedway riders participated in an average of 75.3 ± 15.0 total heats (HS) and obtained PTS + B equal 136.8 ± 48.2. The anaerobic performance, body composition, cardiorespiratory and biochemical responses did not changed after the competitive season. The significant statistical correlations were noted between the differences in the Fatigue Index during WAnT and total number of heats (r = −0.61) and with PTS + B (r = −0.58). Positively correlations were observed also between HS and differences: fat mass (FM) (r = 0.60) and percentage of fat mass (r = 0.61) (all p < 0.05). These findings reveal that the HS during the competitive season is related to the stabilization of anaerobic capacity in the WAnT. The HS is positively correlated with an increase in fat mass, and additional fat mass can adversely affect athletic performance in speedway."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Cynarski, who has developed the theory of cultural dialogues and the General Theory of Fighting Arts. In The Philosophy of martial arts according to Cynarski, are found momentous solutions for the scientific humanities: 1) ontological – regarding the question of the primary non-identity of the warrior with the athlete, 2) anthropological-cultural – showing the distinctiveness of the figure of the martial arts antagonist (the warrior in the literal sense) and the agonist as an athlete and Olympian 3) scientific – explaining the immanent fusion of the philosophy of physical culture with the philosophy of martial arts, and 4) ethical – justifying the moral rightness of the knight fighting to the death in hand-to-hand combat in self-defence or as counter-strike.\nProblem. The author of the paper discusses and evaluates this book on the philosophy of martial arts by Prof. Wojciech J. Cynarski. The question posed here is whether the culture of martial arts contains philosophical thinking combined with the characteristics of scientific humanism. There is also a distinction made between the master of martial arts who is not the same as the master of philosophy.\nMethod. This is a review of a set of essays by Cynarski containing philosophical thoughts about martial arts, sports and culture.\nResults. The author of the book in question is presented; reference is made to the content of the book by reviewing it. A substantive assessment is carried out and the text is significantly assessed.\nConclusion. The Philosophy of Martial Arts according to Wojciech J. Cynarski is a valuable and recommendable book; its author is considered the epitome of chivalry, who shows through his works ways to reach a moral ideal."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Thirteen female and seven male tourism and recreation students participated in the study. Examinations were conducted in November 2020 and in February/March 2021. Students performed the PWC170 test on a cycling ergometer. Maximal oxygen consumption was calculated based on the PWC170 test results. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured at rest, as well as in the 1st and 5th minute of post-exercise recovery. Results: No substantial changes were observed in maximal oxygen consumption level when comparing autumn and winter indices. Male students presented elevated blood pressure whereas female students presented normal blood pressure. Heart-rate and blood-pressure indices did not show substantial alternations in examined students during analyzed period.

Thus, the aim of this work was twofold: (1) to examine congruence between PAPs and DPs by identifying sex differences in healthy and unhealthy behaviors and (2) to assess the explanation behind why certain participants were classified into clusters using BMI and fat mass covariates. Late adolescents (19–21 years of age, n = 107) were selected to study. PAPs and DPs were assessed with questionnaires (IPAQ, QEB) and body height, weight, and fat mass percentage were self-reported (the accuracy and reliability of self-reported data were empirically verified). A cophylogenetic approach with several clustering procedures (heatmaps and tanglegrams) was the way to solve the stated problems. Results showed that students achieved the minimal level of physical activity, lower than students from other regions in Poland, Czech Republic, or Germany. There was congruence between PAPs and DPs in some males’ and females’ behaviors. Significant similarities in sex patterns of behaviors were revealed (Mantel tests–PAPs: r = 0.70, p < 0.001; DPs: r = 0.84, p < 0.001). Similarities in PAPs were related to transportation cycling and school/work activities behaviors. Non-healthy triads in dietary behaviors were found: fast-food, sweetened beverages, and alcoholic drinks in the first, and sweets, fried meals, and yellow cheese in the second. One healthy diad was revealed: vegetables and fruits. Only females’ dietary behaviors were reflected in body mass index (F = 3.19, p = 0.049), percentage of body fat (F = 3.87, p = 0.027), and fat mass index (F = 3.83, p = 0.028). The usefulness of the cophenetic approach in patterns study was verified. Sex similarities and specific disparities could help preparing targeted tailored intervention programs that improve healthy habits in late adolescents.

The study design was a pedagogical experiment with a parallel-group technique, including experimental and control groups. The examination was carried out in 2019/2020 in three terms pre- (September 2019), post- (January 2020), and follow-up (September 2020). Physical fitness was tested with the use of the International Physical Fitness Test. The Brainball program, conducted twice a week for 35 minutes, combined physical education (PE) with subject-related content, utilizing 100 balls with painted letters, numbers, and signs.\n\nResults: Results show that the fitness level was not increased significantly after 20 weeks of the intervention program, neither in experimental nor control groups. However, it significantly improved eight months later at the follow-up examination. The analysis of covariance indicated that pupils from the experimental group improved significantly on most physical fitness as compared to the control group, specifically on the following tests: 50-meter running (p = 0.0044), toe touch (p = 0.0137), standing long jump (p = 0.0076), 4 × 10 m sprint (p = 0.0333), hand strength (p = 0.0233).\n\nConclusions: These results have shown long-term positive effects of the use of “Brainball” educational balls in physical education classes on the physical fitness development of students, especially in the qualities of speed, strength, and flexibility."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Indoor climbing involves overloading the shoulder girdle, including the rotator cuff and upper trapezius muscles. This on the field study aimed to investigate the effects of repeated climbing bouts on morphological and mechanical measures of the upper trapezius muscle.\nMaterials and Methods. Fifteen experienced male climbers participated in the study. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE), blood lactate concentration ([La􀀀]b), and stiffness and thickness over four points of the upper trapezius were assessed before and after a repeated climbing exercise. The procedure for the climbing exercise consisted of five climbs for a total time of 5-minutes per climb, followed by a 5-minute rest.\nResults. The analysis showed an increase from baseline to after the 3rd climb (p\u00140:01) for RPE and after the 5th climb for [La􀀀]b (p\u00140:001). Muscle stiffness and thickness increased at all points (1\u00152\u00153\u00154) after the 5th climb (p \u0014 0:01). We found spatial heterogeneity in muscle stiffness and thickness; muscle stiffness was the highest at Point 4 (p \u0014 0:01), while muscle thickness reached the highest values at points 1\u00152 (both p\u00140:01). Moreover, the analysis between the dominant and non-dominant shoulder showed greater stiffness after the 1st climb at Point 1 (pD0:004) and after the 5th climb at Point 4 (p\u00140:001).\nConclusions. For muscle thickness, the analysis showed significant changes in time and location between the dominant and the non-dominant shoulder. Bilateral increases in upper trapezius muscle stiffness and thickness, with simultaneous increases in RPE and blood lactate in response to consecutive climbs eliciting fatigue."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Some of the participants represented world-class level (e.g., world junior medallists), and most of them were of national elite level. Coordination tests of motor abilities were chosen for their reliability and repeatability and included tests of spatial orientation, rhythmisation of movements, balance and kinaesthetic differentiation. The Foot-O group performed significantly better than the T&F group in terms of some coordination abilities.

Differences among junior and senior riders, and how it changes during a single match (15 heats) and in the subsequent phases of the competitive season (the main and knockout phases) were investigated. The database of reaction times to the starting signal obtained by motorcycle speedway riders was collected from a mobile application called PGE Ekstraliga ver. 1.0.66 (PGE Ekstraliga, Warsaw, Poland). The database included 1.261 results obtained by 65 male riders (age 25.9 ±7.6 years), competing in the highest league in Poland (PGE Speedway Ekstraliga) in the 2021 competitive season. Reaction time was measured using the Pegasus Speedway © telemetry system (Black Burst, Warsaw, PL). Riders scoring 3 points during a heat had the fastest reaction time (F(3,1257) = 8.90, p<0.001, η2 = 0.02), but RT did not influence the final result of the match (p<0.130). The times differ depending on the occupied starting position (F(3,1257) = 6.89, p<0.001, η2 = 0.02), with the fastest RT in the inner position–A compared to the B (p<0.05) and C (p <0.001) positions. Senior riders showed significantly faster RT (0.246s) compared to junior ones (0.258s) (p<0.001). The width of the starting line affects the reaction time (F(3,1257) = 7.94, p<0.001, η2 = 0.02). In the last (15th) heat of the match, RT was the fastest. The fast reaction time during the start affects the scoring of more points in a heat but depends on riders’ experience, the starting position and the straight width of the motorcycle speedway stadium. Coaches should pay attention to these factors when programming training measures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The generalised mixed modelling was employed to estimate the per match mean values of six physical performance-related parameters and 16 technical performance-related parameters of CSL teams in every month of all the eight seasons. Results showed that: (1) the mean values of all the analysed physical performance-related parameters (total/sprint/HSR/MSR distance, sprint/HSR efforts) of CSL teams through a season were characterised like a ‘U’ shape, the highest value was observed in the beginning of season (March), then decreased gradually, reaching the lowest in August, and rebounded progressively from September to November; (2) the mean values of eight technical performance-related parameters (goals, shots, shot accuracy, individual possession, individual possession in the last third, crosses, cross accuracy and yellow cards) presented trivial changes through the whole season; (3) the number of passes, passes per shot, forward passes, and time in individual possession showed trivial changes from March to October, but showed a substantially increase in November (the last month of season); (4) Pass accuracy, forward pass accuracy, and the number of mean ball touches per individual possession substantially increased in June, July and August, whilst the number of challenges, ground challenges, air challenges, tackles and fouls all substantially decreased in these 3 months. These results could provide detailed information to help the practitioners choose the best training and match preparation strategy in the means of periodisation in different season phases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The assumption of this study is that practicing different varieties of mountaineering influences the personality of Polish climbers in a different manner. The aim of the research was to compare the personality differences of Polish mountaineers. To this aim, the population of Polish high-performance mountaineers was studied (N = 81; including 39 women and 42 men). Due to the type of mountaineering practiced, the respondents were divided into Alpine climbers (n = 48) and Himalayan climbers (n = 33). The average age of the surveyed climbers is 33.85 years. The Big Five model was used including the NEO-FFI Personality Questionnaire and the analyzes were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics statistical method package, version 27.0. Statistically significant differences were noted only for agreeableness F(1.77) = 5.05, p = 0.027. The Alpine climbers showed a higher level of agreeableness than the Himalayan climbers. After taking into account the Sidak amendment, significant differences in the level of agreeableness were found only among women. Comparisons between other personality traits were not statistically significant. There is a significant difference between the personalities of Polish Alpine climbers and Polish Himalayan climbers in the dimension of agreeableness only among women: female Alpine mountaineers are more agreeable than Himalayan mountaineers. It was presumed that in terms of ethics in the high mountains, the social competences of Alpine mountaineers are much more developed than that of Himalayan mountaineers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of a short and intensive self-myofascial release (SI-SMR) on jumps in amateur, collegiate athletes. The study sample consists of 30 subjects with an average age of 21.8 years. The tests conducted included a squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), and drop jump (DJ). In the first week, half of the participants performed a standardized warm-up with additional short (15 s per lower limb muscle group) and intensive (20 reps/15 s) SMR and then performed jump tests. The other half performed a standard warm-up. The following week the groups switched interventions. The results revealed a tendency for all jump test parameters (height, force, and power), the reactive strength index, and stiffness to improve with SI-SMR, but the differences were small and insignificant. A dependent t-test for paired samples revealed that only SJ height improvement (+0.96 ± 2.63 cm) reached statistical significance (p = 0.04), but the small ES (ES = 0.14) could have attenuated this result. When a two-way mixed ANOVA was applied, the differences were insignificant. SI-SMR was ineffective in the direct improvement of jump performance. Although SI-SMR had no adverse effects, athletes should focus on specific preparations for sports competitions instead of using an SI-SMR protocol."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The aim of this study was to determine changes in the magnitude and direction of changes in the body morphology and motor abilities of physically active adults over 20 years. Methods: Two hundred and fifty-two individuals aged 18–28 years volunteered to participate in the study. The changes were analyzed over a 20-year period (March 2001; P1 vs. March 2022; P2). The measured parameters were body height, weight, and body fat. Further, hand grip strength with dynamometer measurement, a sit-up test, a sit and reach test, and a standing long jump were performed to examine motor abilities. The results of the conducted tests were compared between subjects from both periods. Results: Our study confirms changes in trends concerning body morphology and motor ability performance. Higher values of body mass index and body fat were observed in P2 women, whereas these differences were not significant in men. Additionally, in terms of physical performance, the P2 group noted worse results than their peers from the past. Conclusion: Despite young adults claiming to have similar physical activity levels to those observed in the past, they demonstrate poorer physical performance and higher body fat levels. The observed changes can be considered negative."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The aim of this study is knowledge about areas most prone to avalanche in Polish part of the Tatra Mountains from the perspective of their specificity and concern for personal safety of potential tourists visiting these places in the future.\n\nMaterial and Methods: The research was conducted using the Snow Avalanche Event Analysis. The Snow Avalanche Event Analysis consists of 6 steps: studying the avalanches, collecting the global data, gathering the local data, comparing the data, assessing the risk, computing the effects. To perform analysis, the authors obtained information from secondary sources on the number of tourists visiting Tatra National Park in 2021 and data on the occurrence of snow avalanches in the Tatra Mountains in the years 1855-2021. The authors applied the Snow Avalanche Event Analysis only in the Polish part of the mountain range, because the Slovak Tatranský Národný Park closes all hiking trails above the mountain shelters in the Slovak part of the Tatras every year from 1 November to 15 June.\n\nResults: The most avalanche-prone areas in the Polish part of the Tatra Mountains are (risk indicators in brackets): Rybiego Potoku Valley (0.020020%), Roztoki Valley and Pięciu Stawów Polskich Valley (0.006252%),  Gąsienicowa Valley (0.004765%).\n\nConclusions: Authors verified positively the formulated research hypothesis: ‘The most avalanche-prone area in Polish part of the Tatra Mountains is the Rybiego Potoku Valley’. The authors successfully applied the SAEA (this time on the example of the Tatra Mountains), which entitles us to recommend this research tool as useful in fulfilling the scientific and social mission of innovative agonology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The reason is that when patients care about their health status, they are inclined to establish a therapeutic relationship with physical therapists. Hence, the care for self may bridge the world of the patient's private experiences and the world of the healthcare system together with its interventions, which is represented by the physical therapist In this framework, care means not only the patient's choice to undergo therapy but also his/her commitment to sustaining its effects in private life. This involves educational interventions by the physiotherapist who inscribes him/herself in his/her patients’ care of the self in order to alter their habits of physical exercise, diet, personal hygiene, body posture, etc. The argument in this paper is informed by the concepts of ethics developed by Michel Foucault and Richard Shusterman."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Fourteen elite track cyclists participated in this study. The exercise protocol consisted of three (on a distance of 62.5 m), one (125 m and 250 m) maximal start accelerations, and sprints from the standing start. Immediately after testing all measurements, PT stiffness and thickness were set at 5-10-15-20 mm distal from the apex of the patella and 5-10 mm proximal to the tibial tuberosity. CSA was set at proximal, middle, and distal, while echogenicity was at proximal and distal points. The results showed significant increases in PT stiffness at all reference points after start acceleration (p<0.001). PT thickness showed similar results as for stiffness, however except for location placed at TT-5 (p<0.001). CSA increased significantly in proximal, middle, and distal regions (p<0.001), while echogenicity of tendon increased in proximal and distal regions (p<0.001) after start acceleration. Regional-dependent alterations of PT thickness and stiffness may be related to anatomical and physiological mechanisms due to acute isometric contraction in the initial phase of standing start. Tendon echogenicity might be also useful in monitoring tendon mechanical properties and defining acute fatigue-induced changes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

This work is a continuation of the previous study of PA and DBs patterns in late adolescents. The main aim of this work was to assess the discriminant power of PA and dietary behaviors and to identify the set of variables that discriminated participants with low, normal, and excessive fat the most. The results were also canonical classification functions that can allow the classification of individuals into adequate groups. A total of 107 individuals (48.6% male) participated in examinations, which used the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Questionnaire of Eating Behaviors (QEB) to assess PA and DBs. The participants self-reported body height, body weight, and BFP, with the accuracy of the data confirmed and empirically verified. Analyses included the metabolic equivalent task (MET) minutes of PA domains and intensity, and indices of healthy and non-healthy DBs, calculated as a sum of the intake frequency of specific food items. At the beginning, Pearson’s r-coefficients and chi-squared tests were calculated to study various relationships between variables, while the main considerations were based on discriminant analyses conducted to determine the set of variables with the most power to distinguish between lean, normal, and excessive body fat groups of participants. Results showed weak relationships between PA domains and strong relationships between PA intensity, sitting time, and DBs. Vigorous and moderate PA intensity related positively to healthy behaviors (r = 0.14, r = 0.27, p < 0.05), while sitting time related negatively to unhealthy DBs (r = −0.16). Sankey diagrams illustrated that lean persons displayed healthy DBs and low sitting time, while those with excessive fat had non-healthy DBs spent more time sitting. The variables that effectively distinguished between the groups include active transport and leisure time domains alongside low-intensity PA, represented by walking intensity and healthy dietary behaviors. The first three variables participated significantly in the optimal discriminant subset (p = 0.002, p = 0.010, p = 0.01, respectively). The discriminant power of the optimal subset (contained four above-mentioned variables) was average (Wilk’s Λ = 0.755) and determined that weak relationships between PA domains and DBs resulted from heterogeneous behaviors and mixed patterns of behaviors. Identifying the trajectory of the frequency flow through specific PA and DBs allowed for well-designed tailored intervention programs to improve healthy habits in adolescents. Therefore, identifying the set of variables that discriminate the most between lean, normal, and excessive fat groups is a suitable target for intervention. The practical achievements are canonical classification functions that can be used to classify (predict) participants in groups based on the three the most discriminating PA and DB variables."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

It also affected the functioning of schools and universities. Many countries have introduced full or partial distance learning. The aim of the study was to assess the level of physical activity and student mood of the Faculty of Physiotherapy of the Academy of Physical Education in Wrocław (Poland) and students of the Faculty of Health of the ODISSE University in Brussels (Belgium) after a year of the study conducted in a mixed mode due to contact restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and checking which of the analyzed factors increases the risk of depression to the greatest extent. Material and methods: 297 students from the 2nd to 4th year of full-time studies took part in the observation. The academic year 2020/2021 was assessed. Physical activity was assessed using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) recommended for this type of analysis by WHO. The GPAQ questionnaire enables the assessment of activity performed at work, movement, and leisure time and assesses the time of sitting or resting in a supine position. The Beck Depression Inventory was used to assess mental health. The subjects also completed a questionnaire concerning selected somatic features and describing their living conditions in the previous year. Results: In the group of Polish students, classes conducted in a completely remote mode accounted for about 50%, while in the group of Belgian students, about 75%. In the described period, 19% of students from Poland and 22% of students from Belgium were infected with COVID-19. The median of the results of the Beck Depression Scale in both groups was lower than 12 points (7 points in the AWF group and 8 points in the ODISSE group, respectively). A detailed analysis showed that in both study groups, more than 30% of students received results showing a depressed mood. A total of 19% of the surveyed students of the University of Physical Education and 27% of the ODISSE students were characterized by a result indicating mild depression. The results of the GPAQ questionnaire show that the total physical activity, including work/study, recreation, and mobility was 16.5 h a week for students from Poland and 7.4 h a week for students from Belgium. Conclusions: Both groups of subjects reached all the thresholds recommended by the WHO as a sufficient level of weekly physical activity. A group of students of the Faculty of Physiotherapy of the University of Physical Education in Wrocław was characterized by more than twice as high (statistically significant) level of weekly physical activity as compared to the group of participants from the ODISSE University in Brussels.

There are relationships between musculoskeletal fitness (MSF) and a FMS. However, there is limited data regarding the multidimensional associations between these two constructs. This study is aimed at investigating the associations and detailed structures of FMS components and MSF components and identifying a deeper detailed structure of their relations to physical fitness. The study sample included 114 physically active men with an average body height of  (cm), body weight of  (kg), and a BMI of  (kg/m2). Each participant performed a FMS test, sit-and-reach (S&R) test, sit-ups (ABS) evaluation, balance evaluation on an AMTI platform, handgrip strength (HG) testing, and standing broad jump (SBJ) ability. The Kendall’s Tau correlation was performed to identify simple associations between FMS and MSF. Cluster analysis was used to determine the multidimensional nature of the relationships. In the vast majority, a positive correlation was observed suggesting that a high level of MSF improved FMS test results. A cluster analysis revealed 4 separate clusters. Shoulder mobility (SM) was identified as a single cluster. A strong similarity was observed between SBJ and trunk stability push-up (TSPU) forming a second cluster. This cluster joined to another consisting of the S&R test and active straight leg raise (ASLR) test. The last cluster consisted of HG and hurdle step (HS). These results confirmed that FMS and MSF tests measure the same constructs—a foundation for an individual’s motor coordination, muscle strength, postural stability, and dynamic balance. This knowledge could be helpful in effectively enhancing physical performance based on combining similar constructs to accelerate the achievement of established goals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine changes in body build, body composition and motor skills in young volleyball female players during an annual training cycle. Methods: The research group was comprised of 36 female athletes aged 14–16 years, who were monitored throughout a whole season using a longitudinal study design. Body composition was estimated by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Motor fitness was assessed with the following tests: vertical jumping tests (based on one-handed and two-handed reach, standing vertical jump and running vertical jump), standing long jump and 2 kg medicine ball throw. Measurements were carried out at the beginning of the preparatory period, after its completion, in the middle of the start period, at the end of the start period and during transition periods. Results: The study showed significant changes in body composition and motor fitness level during the annual training cycle. These changes differ in subsequent periods of the macrocycle. The most pronounced changes occurred after the preparatory period and concerned increases in fat-free mass, total water content and cell mass. A significant reduction in fat content was also noted at this point. Conclusions: Systematic monitoring of morpho-functional changes in young female volleyball players over extended periods provides them a chance to maintain their optimal fitness level."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

But military hand-to-hand combat training uses methods, forms and means from physical culture to ensure soldiers’ all-round psycho-physical development. The combative aspect of preparing soldiers for close combat is based on effective techniques from selected martial arts, combat sports and self-defence systems. The aim of this article is general knowledge about the origin the select of military hand-to-hand combat system techniques in Polish Armed Forces.\n\nMaterial and Methods: The military hand-to-hand combat system of the soldiers of the General Tadeusz Kościuszko Military University of Land Forces was analysed. Due to the civilian nature of this work, the sensitive data of the soldiers cannot be made public. The case study of the research sample was dictated by the accessibility to the Wrocław population of soldiers. The method of observation of exercisers during practical classes and the method of analysis of secondary sources were used.\n\nResults: The analysed system of military hand-to-hand combat is based on hand techniques from boxing. Foot techniques are specific to kyokushin karate. Meanwhile, the techniques of throws, grabs, chokes and levers are based on judo. All incapacitating elements are derived from the Israeli combat system krav maga.\n\nConclusions: The combination of combat techniques from boxing, judo, karate kyokushin and krav maga is highly effective in military close combat. An even use of aspects of martial arts, combat sports and self-defence systems is noted."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5fb779b12467f0455b1e3a7f","name":"Faculty of Security Studies, General Tadeusz Kościuszko Military University of Land Forces","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093af878c28a0473af0e6"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

It is based on the perspective of their spatial differentiation and development. The aim of the paper was to reflect on the phenomenon of geography of Olympic combat sports, which have their roots in ancient times – boxing, fencing, modern pentathlon and wrestling.\n\nMaterial and Methods: The data for the analysis were the boxing, fencing, modern pentathlon and wrestling results from the Olympic Games available via the IOC website (the method of secondary source analysis). In order to relativize the data, two recently developed indicators were applied: the Olympic Games medal winning frequency index (M) and the Olympic Games points winning frequency index (P); the results were presented in the form of maps and tables. A cartographic method – choropleth map and proportional symbol map, including the natural interval method to determine class intervals – was applied to illustrate the findings.\n\nResults: The United States dominates boxing and wrestling in terms of the number and weight of medals won. With regard to fencing, France dominates in terms of the number of medals won, while Italy dominates in terms of the weight of medals won. And in modern pentathlon, Hungary dominates both in terms of the number and weight of medals won.\n\nConclusions: Boxing, fencing, modern pentathlon and wrestling are dominated by the countries in which the respective combat sports were most popular at the time of their introduction to the modern Olympic Games program."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Twenty U18 players were divided into two groups performing six 1 × 1 SSGs with 30 and 45 s bout durations on a playing field of 10 by 15 m. ITL indices, including the percentage of maximum heart rate (HR), blood lactate (BLa) level, pH, bicarbonate (HCO3−) level, and base excess (BE) level, were measured at rest, after each SSG bout, and 15 and 30 min after the entire exercise protocol. ETL (Global Positioning System metrics) was recorded during all six SSG bouts. The analysis showed that the 45 s SSGs had a greater volume (large effect) but a lower training intensity (small to large effect) than the 30 s SSGs. A significant time effect (p < 0.05) was observed in all ITL indices and a significant group effect (F1, 18 = 8.84, p = 0.0082, ƞ2 = 0.33) in the HCO3− level only. Finally, the changes in the HR and HCO3− level were smaller in the 45 s SSGs than in the 30 s SSGs. In conclusion, 30-s games, characterized by a higher intensity of training effort, are more physiologically demanding than 45-s games. Secondly during short-bout SSG training the HR and BLa level have limited diagnostic value for ITL. Extending ITL monitoring using other indicators, such as the HCO3− and BE levels, appears reasonable."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

We evaluated a tailored therapeutic program with dynamic splint and botulinum toxin injections for the treatment of upper extremity muscle spasticity. A case of a 43-year-old woman with chronic spastic hemiparesis after ischemic stroke with significant mobility impairment in the left upper extremity was described. A 16-week program consisted of three 50-min sessions daily and focused on grasping and releasing with and without the splint. The patient was evaluated before botulinum toxin injection and after 6, 12 and 16 weeks according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, and included the following scales: Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment (FMA-UE), Modified Ashworth Scale, Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), MyotonPro, Stroke Impact Scale, Box and Blocks. Photographic documentation made before and after the experiment was compared. Motor functions improved by 19.7% on FMA-UE, spasticity was reduced by one degree and pain at rest and during activity decreased by one score on NRS. A reduction in the oscillation frequency of the relaxed muscle and the stiffness of the examined muscles was observed. The patient regained grasping function. Health-related quality of life was systematically improving with a 35% increase at week 16 compared to the baseline.

The purpose of this study is to examine injury symmetry in judo. Methods: Injuries recorded in 195 people (93 women, 102 men) suffered during top-level judo tournaments were verified. Using the European Judo Union medical questionnaire, information on injuries was obtained from each injured athlete. Results: Based on the analysis of the results, it can be concluded that injuries are almost evenly distributed on the left and right sides of the body in both men and women. In women, there were 129 injuries to the left side (41.2%), 134 injuries to the right (42.8%), and 50 (16.0%) to the middle part of the body. Conclusions: injuries in judo are evenly distributed and slightly more common on the right side. Injuries occur at a greater rate during defending maneuvers than attacking maneuvers in judo. Identification and monitoring of who (tori or uke) and which side of the body sustains an injury are crucial and important in injury prevention. This knowledge makes it possible to modify existing sports regulations by eliminating behaviors (e.g., certain types of defense) to improve the safety of athletes participating in top-level competitions and the training process in terms of ensuring safety in both attack and defense."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Negative and positive effects of tourism in Wroclaw are identified on the basis of research that considered (via nonprobability sampling) the opinions of entrepreneurial representatives participating in tourism organization and service from several sectors of the tourism economy. The findings presented here will help mitigate the above issues while neutralizing the threat of overtourism and its negative impacts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","uid":"bFitDBcx4YvxolIt7JKxDiw","uuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","name":"Uniwersytet WSB Merito w Gdańsku","affiliatedPersonIDs":["634a1b297523402e34127221","5e709298878c28a047398b66"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","parentUuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","rootUuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de0a","uid":"baUDwEr8mzwEHkagRyl8Vhg","uuid":"8395c169-9930-4090-acb2-320b9203f249","name":"Uniwersytet WSB Merito we Wrocławiu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709255878c28a047393df1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de0a","parentUuid":"8395c169-9930-4090-acb2-320b9203f249","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de0a","rootUuid":"8395c169-9930-4090-acb2-320b9203f249","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

To investigate how differences in absolute growth tempo were associated with change in coordination capability within and across peak growth (Aim 2).\nMethods\nParticipants were N1 = 110 (Aim 1) and N2 = 71 (Aim 2) Australian male competitive swimmers, aged 10–15 years, exposed to repeated-measures tracking (2-years, and 12-months respectively) of maturity status, growth tempo and movement coordination capability. Coordination capability was estimated via vertical stiffness (KV) in a hopping task, reflected by participant mean KV and between-jump coefficient of variation (CV).\nResults\nFor Aim 1, log-linear mixed model trends identified maturity status and growth tempo were significantly associated with KV mean and KV CV. For a given maturity status, mean KV was 9% lower in the ‘High’ average growth tempo group than the ‘Low’ average tempo group. For Aim 2, mixed repeated-measures analyses of variance identified how time points of increased growth tempo were significantly associated with 7–11% reductions in mean KV, with similar mean KV decrements irrespective of growth tempo group. Meanwhile, KVCV only illustrated progressive longitudinal reductions.\nConclusions\nWithin maturational progression, short-term accelerations in growth tempo corresponded with short-term decreases in KV mean, suggesting temporary disruptions to movement coordination capability. Measuring growth tempo and applying hopping tasks in specific movement contexts could help consistently identify disturbances in motor coordination."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

One of the best ways to develop COD as well as other components of the game in soccer is the regular inclusion of small sided  games  (SSGs)  in  the  training  process.  Therefore,  the  aim  of  this  research  was  to  determine  changes  in  physiological  and  kinematic  variables  in  repeated  SSGs  in  youth  soccer  players.  Additionally,  we  investigated  the  relationship  between  selected  IMA  variables  such  as  acceleration,  deceleration  and  changes  of  direction.  Participants  included sixteen U17 soccer players from a 2nd league professional team with a high aerobic capacity. The study design involved  six  3-min  4  ×  4  SSGs  with  goalkeepers  and  with  a  3-min  rest  interval  between  games,  during  two  training  sessions played on a field of 25 x 35 m. The results showed that the intervention protocol consisting of repeated SSGs generated  an  intensity  below  the  anaerobic  threshold.  This  allowed  for  the  maintenance  of  all  variables  (Heart  Rate,  Total  Distance  Covered,  Velocity,  Acceleration,  Deceleration,  Change  of  Direction)  at  a  similar  level  throughout  the  subsequent six SSGs. The analysis revealed that in the six SSGs, players performed the most Acc and Dec, then COD Right  and  the  least  COD  Left.  From  the  third  game  on,  a  decrease  in  the  number  of  COD  Right  was  noticed.  We  hypothesized that progressive neuromuscular fatigue on the dominant side caused a more symmetrical trend in COD."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

After therapy, each participant was asked to complete a tailored satisfaction survey using Google Forms. The Health Care Satisfaction Questionnaire (HCSQ) and the International Personality Item Pool-Big Five Markers-20 (IPIP-BFM-20) were used as outcome measures. Considering the results of patient satisfaction with healthcare service, there were no statistically significant differences between telerehabilitation and traditional rehabilitation groups in the total HCSQ score and its subscales. For the complete HCSQ, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion were essential predictor variables, accounting for 51% of the variance in patient satisfaction. In conclusion, there were no differences in patient satisfaction between telerehabilitation and traditional rehabilitation groups. In the telerehabilitation group, higher agreeableness levels and lower conscientiousness and extraversion level could predict patients’ satisfaction with telerehabilitation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

One of these factors is the combination of constant and variable practices. Although many researchers have investigated the combination of practice schedules, these researchers have used measurements that do not assess performance and motor response separately. This study aimed to investigate the effect of different combinations of practice schedules on motor response stability during practice. Participants performed a sequential key-pressing task with two goals: (1) to learn the relative timing dimension and (2) the absolute timing dimension. Participants were assigned to one of two groups: constant-variable or variable-constant. Our findings indicate an influence of the increase in variability over the practice in the constant-variable group. Precisely, the increase in variability of total time in the second half (constant-variable group) of practice was followed by the maintenance of the same level of cross-correlate between absolute timing error and variability of total time. Finally, our findings support the hypothesis that practicing in a constant schedule favors the relative timing dimension of learning regardless of the order in which the constant practice is provided."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Material and Methods: A sample of 22 individuals were divided into an experimental (E) and a control (C) group, tested for maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). The intervention involved 50 min. of front crawl swimming performed at 60%VO2max twice weekly for 6 weeks. ARDSV was induced via tube breathing (1000 ml) in group E during each intervention session. Haematological parameters measured before and after the intervention included red blood cell concentration (RBC), hemoglobin concentration (HGB), haematocrit (HCT), mean cell haemoglobin mass (MCH), mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), white blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes (LYM), monocytes (MON), and granulocytes (GRA). Results: The pre- and post-analysis revealed significant (p < 0.05) changes for groups E and C in the following variables: MCH (E: increase by 4.10%; C: inc. by 3.28%), MCV (E: inc. by 9.39%; C: inc. by 7.48%), and MCHC (E: decrease by 3.52%; C: dec. by 4.05%).

Mixed-longitudinal observations for the 31 players provided complete data for 33 forwards and 43 defenders. Activities of the players during games were monitored with the GPSports SPI Elite System with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz and were analysed with GPSports Team AMS (version R1 2015.14, Australia). Observed variables did not differ between forwards and defenders, and the three periods of play were differentiated only by maximal speed in the second and third periods. The greatest distances covered were in speed zone 3 (10.0–15.9 km h−1; 35.5–38.2%) and the smallest in speed zones 4 (16.0–22.9 km h−1; 14.8–15.6%) and 5 (> 23 km h−1; 0.4–1.4%). The trends indicated high intensity levels for the entire match and by position and periods. Active time of forwards and defenders accounted for about one-half of a game’s duration (~ 15.7 of 30 min). Overall, the Hockey 5s format was highly demanding of players and included relatively short intervals for recovery. The results emphasize the need for preparation that includes specific mixed anaerobic and aerobic training and also the importance of recovery during breaks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Players’ MRPs (n = 244) were collected during UEFA Champions League (UCL) group stage matches in the 2020–21 season. All MRP data were collected by the semi-automatic optical system InStat Fitness (InStat Limited, Limerick, Republic of Ireland). Match-related factors included match outcome, team quality, match location, opponent quality and difference in team quality, while MRP included cumulative and relative measures of total distance (TD and R-TD), low-intensity running (LIR and R-LIR) (≤ 4 m/s), moderate-intensity running (MIR and R-MIR) (4–5.5 m/s) and high-intensity running (HIR and R-HIR) (≥ 5.5 m/s). Linear mixed models were used to examine the collective effect of match-related factors on MRPs when controlling for between-player, between-playing position and between-team variation. The main findings were that match outcome was associated with reduced HIR (d = -0.38, p = 0.04), match location was associated with increased TD, R-TD, LIR and R-LIR (d = 0.54–0.87, all p < 0.01), while team quality, opponent quality and difference in team quality were not associated with MRP. These results show that (i) winning UCL matches was not strongly influenced by players’ physical performance, (ii) away UCL matches were characterized by a slower match pace and greater match volume, and (iii) players’ physical performance was similar irrespective of playing either in or against high- or low-quality teams. The findings from this study may help soccer coaches to ensure optimal physical preparation of players in elite soccer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

In our study, we examined the association between facial attractiveness and three sexually dimorphic measures of ocular morphology in White Europeans: the sclera size index, width-to-height ratio, and relative iris luminance. Sixty participants (30 women) assessed the attractiveness of the opposite-sex photographs of 50 men and 50 women.

Wide midfielders and forwards in LPBPT covered more total distance, low-intensity running, and achieved greater average speed than in HPBPT (all large effect sizes [ES]). Central defenders and fullbacks covered more high-intensity running (small ES), while CMs covered more sprinting (medium ES) in HPBPT than in LPBPT. Players on all playing positions produced greater number of passes and successful passes in HPBPT than in LPBPT (large ES), except forwards who produced more passes in LPBPT than in HPBPT (small ES). Both physical and technical performance were highly dependent on ball possession percentages, with evident position-specific changes, indicating that the effect of ball possession is highly position-dependent.

One is maintaining a stable body posture, which limits their participation in activities and games with peers. The study aimed to assess balance parameters in children with weakened axial muscle tone who underwent sensory integration therapy (SI). The study group consisted of 21 children (divided into three age groups) referred by a doctor for therapy. Methods: The ZEBRIS platform was used to measure the balance parameters (MCoCx, MCoCy, SPL, WoE, HoE, and AoE). The study was conducted twice: before and after two months of sensory integration therapy. The results were compiled using the TIBICO® Statistica software version 13.3.0. Results: After the SI program, statistically significant changes were observed in the values of MCoCy_oe, WoE_oe, AoE_oe in the group of four-year-olds, MCoCX_ce in the group of five-year-olds, and in SPL_ce and AoE_ce in six-year-olds. A statistically significant, highly positive correlation was observed between body height and changes in SPL_oe, HoE_oe, and AoE_oe in the group of six-year-olds, as well as in the case of changes in SPL_oe in the group of five-year-olds. In the group of four-year-olds, a statistically significant correlation occurred only between body height and the change in the MCoCx_oe value. Conclusions: the sensory integration therapy used in the study group of 4–6-year-old children with reduced muscle tone gave positive results in the form of improved static balance and balance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Therefore, the aim of the study was to analyse the level of perceived generalised stress, the occupational stress and the occupational burnout syndrome among physiotherapists during the COVID-19 pandemic. One hundred seventy professionally active physiotherapists participated in the study: 100—during the pandemic and 70 before the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was carried out using the authors’ survey, the Subjective Work Assessment Questionnaire (SWAQ), the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Mini-COPE) inventory. The physiotherapists examined prior to the pandemic exhibited a higher level of generalised stress and higher level of occupational stress and occupational burnout (p = 0.0342; p < 0.00001; p < 0.00001, respectively). The key factors which caused intensified occupational stress in both groups included the lack of rewards at work, social interaction, and the lack of support. The results suggest that healthcare professionals including physiotherapists are exposed to occupational stress and a high risk of occupational burnout, not only during the COVID-19 pandemic. Occupational stress prevention programmes should be based on the identification and elimination of all occupational risks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Quality of life may be one of potential determinants of\nphysical activity. The aim of this article is to identify the relationships between physical activity and quality of life in\nentrepreneurs from Wroclaw, Poland. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on a group of 616 entrepreneurs (216 women and 400 men). A diagnostic survey method was used with a direct interview technique. The research tools included the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire.\nResults Among the studied entrepreneurs, along with their higher ratings of overall quality of life, the odds of high\nrather than low levels of physical activity increased nearly fivefold (OR 4.86, CI 3.34–7.07). Entrepreneurs with higher\nassessment levels of their perceived health condition were nearly twice as likely to report high rather than low physical\nactivity levels (OR 1.92, CI 1.42–2.59). The conditional probability of high rather than low levels of physical activity\nalso increased in the entrepreneurs with higher assessments of quality of life in the physical, psychological, social, and\nenvironmental domains, by 34%, 11%, 5%, and 6%, respectively.\nConclusion Programs promoting physical activity among entrepreneurs, which focus on moderate and high intensity\nexercise, should be considered desirable in the context of the study findings. Activities aimed at improving quality\nof life in the physical and psychological domains as a potential determinant of the level of physical activity of entrepreneurs\nare also worth recommending."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This study involved professional soccer players from 24 teams participating in the group stage of UEFA Champions League in season 2020/21. The match status was divided into seven phases that result in changing or maintaining the match outcome: DW (Drawing to Winning); LD (Losing to Drawing); WW (Winning to Winning); DD (Drawing to Drawing); LL (Losing to Losing); DL (Drawing to Losing); WD (Winning to Drawing). Such running performance variables as: total distance covered (TDC) and distance covered in high-intensity running (HIR) were analyzed. Players participating in the UEFA Champions League matches cover the longest TDC in DW, DL and DD phases. TDC in these stages was between 111 and 123 m min−1. The highest HIR was recorded during phases: DW, DL and LL (range between 9.91 and 10.82 m min−1). In contrast, the lowest total distance and distance in HIR is covered during WD phase (only 105.57 ± 1.89 m min−1 and 7.34 m min−1 respectively). On average, phases resulting in the change of the match status occur during the first half, while all phases maintaining the result in the second half. Coaching staffs should consider registering and analysing the physical match performance in relation to described seven match status phases. Such information allows to prepare team-specific training drills, that players should perform more often in order to change or maintain the status of the game."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

The main goals of this study were: 1) to examine estimated optimal load and PPO based on a force-velocity test and 2) to compare the PPO from the previous method with the Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT). The study involved 15 academic male athletes, aged 22.4 ± 2.3 (years), height 178.9 ± 6.8 (cm), and body weight 77.9 ± 12.2 (kg). They performed the 30-s WAnT (7.5% of body weight) during the first visit to the laboratory. Second to fourth session included a force-velocity test (FVT) involving three, 10-s all-out sprints. A randomized load ranging from 3 to 11 kg was used in each session for FVT. The OPTLOAD and PPO were computed using quadratic relationships based on power-velocity (P-v) and power-percent of body weight (P-%BM) and including three, four, five and nine sprints from FVT. The results showed non-difference in OPTLOAD [13.8 ± 3.2 (%BM); 14.1 ± 3.5 (%BM); 13.5 ± 2.8 (%BM); 13.4 ± 2.6 (%BM)] executed at three, four, five, and nine sprints (F3,56 = 0.174, p = 0.91, η2 = 0.01). The two-way ANOVA revealed that PPO were similar between tested models (P-%BM vs. P-v) independently from the numbers of sprints (F3,112 = 0.08, p = 0.99, η2 = 0.000). Moreover, the PPO measured in the WAnT (870.6 ± 179.1 W) was significantly lower compared with in P-v model (1,102.9 ± 242.5–1,134.2 ± 285.4 W) (F4,70 = 3.044, p = 0.02, η2 = 0.148). In addition, the PPO derived from P-%BM model (1,105.2 ± 245.5–1,138.7 ± 285.3 W) was significantly higher compared with the WAnT (F4,70 = 2.976, p = 0.02, η2 = 0.145).

However, these objectives cannot exist only in the minds of hotel employees and managers, but should be communicated to all stakeholders, including hotel guests. Looking at the problem of environmental degradation more broadly, it is worth noting that the need to reverse the anti-ecological tendencies of world economies is becoming not so much a regional challenge as a global one. Thus, pro-ecological solutions implemented in individual hotels and even hotel chains cannot remain the exclusive domain of such establishments, but should be popularised, or at least easily accessible to other hotel chains, which, in this respect, function as coopetitors with the same goal in mind rather than competitors. The cognitive aim of this study is to identify the characteristic features of ecological awareness and to propose recommendations for pro-ecological behaviours in the form of open eco-innovations. The achievement of this objective required the execution of a research project involving 1351 hotel guests. The research was carried out using a questionnaire method in Poland’s largest cities during the holiday months of 2021.

Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the level of perceived stress and anxiety in pregnant women depending on social support and their physical activity both before and during pregnancy and find the factors that affected the level of perceived stress. Methods. A total of 373 pregnant women were qualified for the study. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and a self-administered questionnaire were used. Results. In the study group, a high level of stress and anxiety were noted. A comparative analysis showed that physically active women before pregnancy, women attending childbirth classes and remaining in a relationship, were characterized by a lower level of stress and anxiety compared to physically inactive women, women who did not participate in childbirth classes and were single. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that participation in childbirth classes, physical activity before pregnancy, the level of anxiety as a trait, and women’s age had the most significant impact on the stress level of surveyed women. Conclusions. Further research among pregnant women and women in the postpartum period is needed to confirm the benefits of physical activity and to identify as many factors as possible that may affect the emotional state of pregnant women."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

An innovative and repeatedly used method in oncology departments is virtual reality (VR). To date, no one has used VR for head and neck cancer patients in an attempt to stimulate their working memory. The goal of our research is to intervene with off-the-shelf VR applications in HNC patients to lower the risk of CRCI. Twenty-two patients with head and neck cancer were enrolled in this pilot study to characterize their visuospatial memory capacity, a form of working memory. During the oncological treatment, the patient had 30 min sessions, three times a week, using publicly available applications of VR. No significant changes were observed in the pre- and post-study. The individual patient results present a favorable trend of changes in their working memory after the intervention: despite oncological treatment, visual-spatial memory did not deteriorate in 88% of patients, including 28% of patients with higher scores than before the intervention. In this pilot study, VR was safely used in patients with head and neck cancer with no negative side effects. The use of VR may prevent CRCI in most HNC patients and, in some, VR may improve their cognitive functioning. A more rigorous study with larger numbers and controls is advised."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709232878c28a047391844"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This study aimed to assess the effect of exposure to a natural disaster (cyclone Aila) in utero or during infancy on fine and gross motor functions in preadolescent Indian children. The study was conducted in West Bengal, India, and included approximately 700 children (7–10 years old) who were prenatally or postnatally exposed to cyclone Aila and a nonaffected group. Anthropometric measures included height, weight, and birthweight. Socioeconomic status was based on parental education, family size, and income. Motor functions were assessed using the short form of Bruininks–Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOT-2). Statistical analyses included, for example, generalized linear models. There were no differences in motor functions relative to the timing of the exposure (trimester) during pregnancy. Compared to the controls, prenatal Aila exposure resulted in poorer performance in all BOT-2 subtests, except for fine motor precision, strength, and balance (the last in boys), while postnatal Aila exposure, compared to the controls, resulted in poorer performance in manual dexterity, bilateral coordination, balance (girls only), and speed and agility. Early life exposure to a natural disaster has long-term adverse effect on motor proficiency in children. By inference, the welfare of pregnant women and infants should be of particular concern for emergency and health services during an environmental cataclysm."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This study challenges that notion and compares two common durations of sprint cycling performance with not only peak power, but power out to 20-min. There is also a belief where maximal efforts of longer durations will be detrimental to sprint cycling performance. 56 data sets from 27 cyclists (21 male, 6 female) provided maximal power for durations from 1-s to 20-min. Peak power values are compared to assess the strength of correlation (R2), and any relationship (slope) across every level. R2 between 15-s– 30-s power and durations from 1-s to 20-min remained high (R2 ≥ 0.83). Despite current assumptions around 1-s power, our data shows this relationship is stronger around competition durations, and 1-s power also still shared strong relationships with longer durations out to 20-min. Slopes for relationships at shorter durations were closer to a 1:1 relationship than longer durations, but closer to long-duration slopes than to a 1:1 line. The present analyses contradicts both well-accepted hypotheses that peak power is the main driver of sprint cycling performance and that maximal efforts of longer durations out to 20-min will hinder sprint cycling. This study shows the importance and potential of training durations from 1-s to 20-min over a preparation period to improve competition sprint cycling performance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The analysis of the literature and observations lead to the hypothesis that despite the similarities in men's and women's volleyball, the nature of the way of playing between women and men differs. The observation covered 39 male and 24 female elite volleyball players. We used a proprietary software tool, namely OpenCV to assess the jump height library. The analysis was performed on the jump serve height (SJH), attack jump height (AJH), and block jump height (BJH). The following analysis was performed to confirm the differences in the height of the jump and partially confirm the hypothesis. The main difference between men's and women's volleyball is how the serve, attack and block jump height affect winning or losing match sets. In male volleyball players, there is a decrease in the parameters of SJH, AJH and BJH in subsequent sets of matches, while in female volleyball players this relationship is reversed. For men, it seems reasonable to strive to increase the height of a jump to maximize effective offensive actions, as well as to maintain the developed performance throughout a match. In women's volleyball, it is worth using such training measures that allow players would achieve their maximum jumping abilities from the first set, and the main training goal should be focused on the technique and tactics of the whole team."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Learning and gaining knowledge by traveling have been present in human history for centuries. Education does so well in tourism because it is accompanied by human curiosity about the world. Tourism can teach natural, social, and historical sciences. It is an important tool for learning about the past that influences the present and the future, especially if it is a difficult past such as the memory of the Holocaust. Tourism can help to draw conclusions about the past as long as it contributes to the acquisition of specific knowledge. Considering this role of tourism, it is worth asking when tourism starts? Many authors see the beginning of tourism at the stage of gathering information. The main assumption of this publication can be summarized as the consideration that the quality of an educational tourist product depends on the availability of information, its quality, and the manner in which it is provided. Today, the most important information distribution channel is digital media, including both websites and social media. Well-provided information accelerates the development of a resource, destination, or region; at the same time, information provided incorrectly or a lack of information in the virtual space may be an inhibitor of the development of educational tourism. The aim of the article is to assess the manner of communicating information related to the Holocaust of World War II, which took place in Nazi German-occupied Poland. The study was conducted with the use of qualitative methods—expert assessment and assessment of the information transfer effectiveness based on the scoring method. The research material included existing websites presenting the resources and methods of operation of museums dedicated to the Holocaust located in Poland. During evaluation, particular attention was paid to the scope of information, methods of its transmission, its internationalization, and timeliness of activities, especially in the field of promoting elements of the offer related to education and shaping attitudes. The aim of the research was to organize the official Internet resources, classify them, and discuss the functioning of information on the Holocaust in the virtual space, so as to use the potential of information in the most effective way to create a product for educational tourism."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709232878c28a0473917e8"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

One of the solutions for monitoring the player in indoor sports are computer video analyses, which determine basic kinematic parameters. The study aims to compare team and player activity with the outcome of a given set and the effect of the game status on player activity during a championship-level match. Materials and Methods: The study analysed 140 volleyball players aged 19 to 40 years (27.05 ± 4.33 years, height: 197.15 ± 9.63 cm, body mass: 88.51 ± 9.23 kg) participating in the FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship. The observed matches were categorised by score (3:0, 3:1, 3:2 and 0:3, 1:3 and 2:3). Depending on winning or losing, each set was described as W – a winning set, P – a losing set and O – as the first set. Results: The average distance covered in all observed matches was 10.7 ± 0.09 m, while for matches completed in 3 sets, it was 10.48 ± 0.13 m. Attackers covered the longest distance in action (11.43 ± 1.68 m), while the libero covered the shortest distance from among all observed players (8.79 ± 1.91 m). The losing teams covered a significantly greater distance in action (10.87 ± 2.24 m) in action than the winning teams (10.54 ± 1.91 m). Conclusion: The results of this study allow the conclusion that teams winning sets cover a smaller average distance in action than their opponents.

Therefore, this systematic review with meta-analysis aimed to analyze the effects of VR and AVG on fear, physical functions, and quality of life.\n\nMethods: A systematic search was performed independently in Scopus, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library electronic databases for relevant randomized controlled and crossover studies. From a total of 5,963 records, 11 met the inclusion criteria. After full-text screening two publications were excluded, yet six studies were included in the quantitative analysis because three studies had a large discrepancy in their measured outcomes. For methodological quality assessments, the RoB2 software program was used, while RevMan 5.4.1 was used for statistical analysis and meta-analysis. Standard Mean Difference (SMD) outcome measures were used for the analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic with a cut-off value of 50% considering intervention and outcome measures.\n\nResults: Our systematic review includes six randomized controlled studies and three randomized crossover studies. The participants represented both sexes and were children and adolescents (<18 years old) with a diagnosis of cancer. The analysis of the results allows for a careful conclusion that VR has the potential to become an accessory tool in rehabilitation and oncologic treatment. All of the included studies noted a significant advantage of this intervention.\n\nConclusion: VR has the potential to be an effective and important tool in the oncologic treatment of children. VR immerses the patient, and as a result, produces a distraction that effectively reduces pain associated with standard oncologic care procedures in children. However, this systematic review and meta-analysis highlights the need for more research into the use of VR as support for pediatric oncologic care."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Therefore, this study aimed to establish if sex differences exist in the PAPE effect on jump height. The study included 30 males and 15 females aged between 19 and 25, with relative strength in the back squat of at least 110% of body weight and a minimum of 3 years of resistance training experience. A baseline countermovement jump (CMJ) was performed, and the PAPE protocol, which involved three 4-s sets of isometric full-back squats with a 1-min rest interval, was introduced. Five CMJs were performed over the following 9 minutes in 2 minutes rest intervals. Changes (Δ) towards the baseline and each jump height results were calculated and analyzed in the absolute (cm) and relative (%) approach. The repeated measures ANOVA with sex as between-groups effect and time of the changes as within-group effect were conducted. Results showed statistically significant interaction (sex×time) in absolute changes (Δ cm) (F = 2.50, η2 = 0.05, p = 0.0447), which indicated that the sex effect has changed over time. Post-hoc test showed that during the first 3 minutes, men and women benefited equally, but in the fifth and seventh minutes, the observed changes were greater in men, thus close to significance (p = 0.0797, p = 0.0786), and in the last minute, the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0309). Also, a statistically significant interaction effect was observed for relative changes (Δ %) (F = 4.22, η2 = 0.09, p = 0.0027). At the beginning (the first and third minutes), changes in females were greater than in males, but the differences were insignificant. However, after 5 minutes, the decrease in females was observed with statistically significant differences in the last minute compared to males (p = 0.0391). Chi-Squared analysis indicated that the time to peak performance was insignificant (χ2 = 7.45, p = 0.1140) in both sexes. The introduced PAPE protocol based on isometry improved jump height in both sexes, with performance enhancement recorded in the third-minute post-activation. However, performance decreased in females over the next 6 minutes, while it was maintained in the male group. Despite the generally positive short-term effects of the protocol on females, the usefulness of the protocol is limited."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Due to the location of the prostate in the lower urinary\ntract area, changes within it can impair urinary function. Therefore, early intervention, accurate diagnostics,\nand appropriate treatment are crucial, especially conservative methods in the first stage.\nAim of the study: The study aimed to use and evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic massage in BPH.\nCase report: A 55-year-old patient diagnosed with BPH received a course of therapeutic massage lasting\nthree weeks, with the procedure performed twice a week. Each massage lasted twenty minutes and involved\nmanipulation of the stomach lining. The patient underwent imaging tests before and after the therapy. On\nthe International Prostate Symptom Score scale, the patient scored three points before the therapy and two\npoints after it, which indicates mild symptoms. Prostate-specific antigen level was 1.421 ng/ml, and the patient\nhad normal uroflowmetry results [Qmax=19 ml/s and Qmedium=12 ml/s] before and after treatment. Urine\nretention after micturition was 0 ml at both intervals. A transrectal ultrasound examination revealed a reduced\nprostate volume of around 30% after the therapeutic intervention.\nConclusions: In the current case, the positive effect of reduced prostate volume obtained after therapeutic\nintervention shows that massage can serve as a complementary method to reduce BPH symptoms. In the\nfuture, it is advisable to continue testing on more patients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This cross-section study analyses retrospective data of femaleand male track sprint cyclists for sex differences. We hypothesized that women wouldexhibit lower peak power to weight than men, as well as demonstrate a differentdistribution of power durations related to sprint cycling performance.Design:We used training, testing, and racing data from a publicly available onlinedepository (www.strava.com), for 29 track sprint cyclists (eight women providing 18datasets, and 21 men providing 54 datasets) to create sex-specific profiles. R2wasused to describe model quality, and regression indices are used to compare watts perkilogram (W/kg) for each duration for both sexes against a 1:1 relationship expectedfor 15-s:15-s W/kg.Results:We confirmed our sample were sprint cyclists, displaying higher peak andcompetition power than track endurance cyclists. All power profiles showed a highmodel quality (R2≥0.77). Regression indices for both sexes were similar for alldurations, suggesting similar peak power and similar relationship between peakpower and endurance level for both men and women (rejecting our hypothesis).The value of R2for the female sprinters showed greater variation suggesting greaterdifferences within female sprint cyclists.Conclusion:The mainfinding shows female sprint cyclists in this study have verysimilar relationships between peak power and endurance power as men. Highervariation in W/kg for women in this study than men, within these strongrelationships, indicates women in this study, had greater inter-athlete variability, andmay thus require more personalised training. Future work needs to be performedwith larger samples, and at different levels to optimize these recommendations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The CGA assessment was performed twice: before and after a 12 week stay at the centre. Physiotherapy was carried out five times a week for one hour (Monday to Friday).\nResults\nThe analysis showed a significant improvement in the Activities of Daily Living scale (ADL). In the case of the physical condition of the patients, the physiotherapy led to significant improvements, predominantly in the gait and balance of the patients. Significant correlations, at the start and end of the study, were found between the ADL and Tinetti scale.\nConclusions\nThere was a significant relationship found between the functional status and physical health of the patients undergoing physiotherapy staying at the NH. The systematic 3-month physiotherapy significantly improved the functional and physical condition of elderly patients.

Superficial dorsal and plantar temperature of both feet was meas\u0002ured in all participants. The measurements were taken using a ThermoVision FLIR SYSTEM T335.\nResults. In both study groups, the temperature of the dorsal side of the foot was higher than the temperature of the plantar \nside. The observed difference in the control group was clearly larger than in the group of diabetic patients, and amounted to \n1.7°C and 1.0°C. In the patients with diabetes the plantar temperature was higher by an average of 2.2°C, and the dorsal tem\u0002perature was higher by an average of 1.5°C compared to the control group.\nConclusions.

There is a rising number of injuries to pedestrians using a cell phone. Texting on a cell phone while walking is an emerging problem among people of different ages. The aim of this experiment was to investigate whether using a cell phone while walking affects walking velocity, as well as cadence, stride width, and length in young people. Forty-two subjects (20 males, 22 females; mean age: 20.74 ± 1.34 years; mean height: 173.21 ± 8.07 cm; mean weight: 69.05 ± 14.07 kg) participated in the study. The subjects were asked to walk on an FDM−1.5 dynamometer platform four times at a constant comfortable velocity and a fast velocity of their choice. They were asked to continuously type one sentence on a cell phone while walking at the same velocity. The results showed that texting while walking led to a significant reduction in velocity compared to walking without the phone. Width, cadence, and length of right and left single steps were statistically significantly influenced by this task. In conclusion, such changes in gait parameters may result in an increased risk of pedestrian crossing accidents and tripping while walking. Phone use is an activity that should be avoided while walking."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Only a few studies have investigated the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on the prevalence of non-responders (NRs) in adolescents while considering health-related fitness measurements and other co-variables. Therefore, the aim of the current work was twofold: (1) to assess the effects of ten weeks of school-based HIIT on the prevalence of responders (Rs) and NRs for body composition, resting blood pressure (BP), cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness, and (2) to assess the relationship of this prevalence with sex, body mass category, and biological maturation status, while estimating the likelihood of a response. Adolescents aged 16 years (n = 73) were included in the study. Waist-to-hip ratio, body fat percentage (BFP), skeletal muscle mass (SMM), BP, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), and musculoskeletal fitness were the primary outcomes. Co-variables included sex, body mass index (BMI), and maturity offset. The percentages of the Rs and NRs were analyzed based on changes (Δ) between post-intervention and pre-intervention values. The typical error (TE) method was used to identify Rs and NRs. Results showed a variation in the relative size of changes (% of changes) depending on the variable and sex. The greatest changes were observed in females’ abdomen muscle strength (Δ% = 23.89%), and the difference from that of males (Δ% = 5.98%) was statistically significant (p < 0.001) with very large effect size of (Cohen’s d = 0.941). Similar significant differences in relative changes were observed in body composition, but in the reverse direction. Males gained more from HIIT in the decrease in the body fat percentage (Δ% = −8.24%) and increase in skeletal muscle mass (Δ% = 3.38%) comparing to females (Δ% = 0.46, p = 0.040 and Δ% = 1.06%, p = 0.007, respectively). Effect size for body fat was small (Cohen’s d = 0.469), and for skeletal muscle mass it was moderate (Cohen’s d = −0.659). The results also showed positive significant differences in the prevalence of Rs compared to NRs in BFP, SMM, systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), CRF, and abdominal muscular strength (ABS) (p = 0.047, p = 0.047, p < 0.001, p = 0.003, p = 0.014, and p = 0.014, respectively). The effect was greatest and largest for SBP (Cohen’s ω = 0.67). Sex was related to the prevalence of Rs for ABS and close to significance for SMM. More males than females benefited from HIIT in SMM (p = 0.058), but more females than males had ABS benefits (p = 0.050). Males were more likely (2.5-fold) to be Rs than females in SMM. BMI was not related to the prevalence of Rs and NRs. Biological maturation was related to the prevalence of Rs and NRs in SMM (p = 0.036) and SBP (p = 0.016). In SBP, 100% of the early matured derived benefit from HIIT, but the effect size was small (Cramer’s V = 0.27). Those who maturated later were more likely (almost 70%) to be Rs. Thus, the HIIT program introduced to a typical physical education (PE) lesson can be considered partially effective. Therefore, there is a need to continue the search for an optimal and effective program for all health-related parameters. The close relationship between analyzed values and sex and biological maturation, but not BMI, indicates that the intervention programs should be tailored specifically for males and females."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The purpose of this study\nwas knowledge of the probable differences in the technical-tactical training of judo athletes of the Japanese,\nGeorgian and French national teams.\nMaterial and Methods: The research material consisted of audio-video recordings of IJF senior international competitions from\n2017-2018. The fight recordings can be found in the collection of multimedia files on the websites www.\njudobase.ijf.org and www.dartfish.tv. The course of the fights was analysed by a high-class judo coach with\nmany years of coaching and competition experience. Total 1769 fights were studied, 4010 technical actions and 1976 penalties were recorded. The following were evaluated: the technical actions used, the activity in attack and the proportions of their components, as well as the effectiveness of the actions.\nResults: It was found that Japanese competitors showed the highest activity during fights. A weak correlation was found\nbetween national team membership and the frequency of effective attacks, ineffective attacks and forced penalties during the fight. In contrast, this relationship at a moderate level was noted in the first part of the fight.\nWhen comparing the techniques used, a moderate statistically significant relationship was found between the\naffiliation of the national teams studied and: classification taking into account torso rotations, Kodokan classification and method of attack application. A weak one between the affiliation of the studied national teams\nand the side of the lean with which the attack was combined. Georgia competitors had the highest average\nreferee’ scores. It was statistically significantly different from the marks received by the French representatives. Statistically significant differences between the effectiveness of the actions of the competitors of the\nstudied national teams also occurred in the following areas: throws with a rotation of the torso, throws without a rotation of the torso, hand throws, sacrifice techniques, single attacks, forward direction of the attack,\nthrows applied to the right, the first part of the fight and the second part of the fight.\nConclusions: The characteristics of the technical-tactical training of the studied teams, as determined in the study, should\nbe used as models in planning the formation of the competitor’s technical-tactical training. They can also be\nused by coaches of national teams preparing judokas for confrontation with competitors of the studied teams."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The experimental group took part in 1 massage session of the thenar eminence muscles for 5 minutes. The control group spent 5 minutes on a couch in the same position as in the experimental group, receiving no intervention. In both groups, at the beginning and end of the session, LAT was tested with a tensiomyograph and algometer.\nResults: Statistically significant differences between the groups occurred in pressure pain threshold (p=0.02), contraction time (p=0.01), relaxation time (p=0.01) and sustain time (p=0.046) of the latissimus dorsi muscle.

Leptin is a secretory adipokine involved in the central control of appetite that appears to play a role in the etiology of feeding-related disorders. Additionally, the influence of exercise on feeding behaviors potentially modulates the circulation of metabolites that signal through the central nervous system. In this systematic review, we collected the recent clinical evidence on the effect of exercise on leptin concentrations in health individuals published from 2000 to 20 September 2022, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA 2020 statement). Six hundred and thirty-eight papers were retrieved and forty-eight papers were included in the qualitative synthesis. Data supports that exercise positively influences appetite via enhancing peripheral and central leptin signaling (reuptake), especially during weight loss. Exercise modulation of leptin signaling through leptin receptors helps to stabilize increases in food intake during periods of negative energy balance, prior to a decrease in the body fat tissue content. At a high intensity, exercise appears to counteract leptin resistance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The first and second stages of the research protocol included a treadmill running exercise with increasing load and six 3-min four-versus-four games of soccer with a 3-min break between games. Players then participated in a training microcycle involving three specific HIIT exercises twice per week for 4 weeks, after which they repeated stages one and two, followed by an assessment of changes. The measurement of lactate (LA) determined ANT, whereas the choice reaction time (CRT) indicated PFT among other selected physiological parameters. The repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared mean values for the examined variables using Bonferroni post hoc test. It demonstrated significantly increased maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) from 45.9 ± 3.0 to 48.7 ± 2.6 at the ANT and from 49.1 ± 3.4 to 52.0 ± 3.6 on the PFT after 4 weeks of training. A significant increase in the running speed (RS) at both thresholds and heart rate (HR) at the ANT (p ≤ 0.05) was also recorded. Moreover, the players exceeded their intensity of effort during ANT while playing four-versus-four soccer matches, but they did not reach intensity during PFT. In conclusion, the findings of the study demonstrated that both thresholds shifted toward higher loads and the proposed specific HIIT effectively increased the exercise capacity of soccer players."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Thus, the aims were to apply an integrative load monitoring approach, previously established in rink-hockey, in professional soccer; extend this approach with further data (Short Recovery and Stress Scale); assess this (extended) approach, thereby further evaluating the relationship between the used external load (EL) measures (total distance, distance above 55% and 70% of individual maximal speed, number of accelerations and decelerations > 4 m/s2, total loading) and the internal load (IL) measure session rate of perceived exertion training load (sRPE-TL) as well as between the used EL measures and sRPE. This retrospective observational cohort study analyzed data from a Swiss team collected over a 14 week-period during the 2021/22 season. Based on our findings, the integrative approach tested proved to be an applicable load monitoring tool in professional soccer, placing players on a fitness-fatigue continuum throughout the different microcycle sessions without using tests, thus providing relevant information to individually tailor training programs. sRPE-TL (ρ [95% CI] = .55 [.51 to .59] to .87 [.85 to .88]; all p < .001) better reflected the EL experienced by players than sRPE (ρ [95% CI] = .45 [.40 to .50] to .71 [.69 to .75]; all p < .001) supporting the definition of sRPE-TL as a measure of IL. However, for even stronger relevance of the tested tool, further research is warranted, especially to ascertain its sensitivity and determine an optimal selection of EL and IL measures. In sum, the present data clearly demonstrate the importance of load management taking place at an individual level, even within team structures, thereby analyzing a set of both EL and IL measures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Furthermore, the responses of responders and non-responders to HIIT in terms of these physiological outcomes have also been examined. However, the minimal detectable change (MDC) in BP and CRF has not been addressed yet. Therefore, the current study aimed to compare the MDC90 of BP (systolic and diastolic) and CRF (fitness index (FI) results) in the context of a school-based HIIT program for adolescents. Participants were adolescents, with an average age of 16.16 years (n = 141; 36.6% males). A preplanned secondary analysis was conducted using pre–post data from the control group to estimate MDC90. The MDC90 of SBP, DBP, and FI were 7.82 mm HG, 12.45 mm HG, and 5.39 points, respectively. However, taking into account the relative values of these changes, MDC90 required a greater change in DBP (17.27%) than FI (12.15%) and SBP (6.68%). Any training-induced physiological changes in the average values of the outcomes did not exceed MDC90. However, a comparison of the participants who exceeded and did not exceed MDC90 showed statistically significant differences. These findings reveal the huge variability in and insensitivity to the intervention effect for all measurements.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to study the relationship between the personality traits and the sports classes of Polish junior sports acrobatics representatives. The respondents (N = 90) were juniors aged 18–19 and were divided into three samples: (1) n = 30 Polish representatives in sports acrobatics with a first or master sports class; (2) n = 30 kata athletes from Kyokushin karate and Shotokan karate as a reference sample from another sports discipline with gymnastic movement expression; (3) n = 30 high school students as a reference sample of non-athletic persons. The Big Five model was used, and the NEO-FFI personality questionnaire was used as a research tool. For the analyses of basic descriptive statistics, the Kruskal–Wallis test and Mann–Whitney test were performed to determine statistical significance (α = 0.05). It was noted that all athletes (the first and second samples) had personality traits at the same levels: low neuroticism, high extraversion, moderate openness to experience and agreeableness, and high conscientiousness in relation to non-athletes. In contrast, there were differences among the subjects in personality traits, except for agreeableness. Among the sports acrobats, master-class athletes showed lower neuroticism, greater openness to experience, lower agreeableness, and greater conscientiousness in relation to first-class athletes. It was found that there were differences between the personality traits and sports classes of junior sports acrobatics representatives in Poland in the four Big Five dimensions. But in general, sports acrobats and karate athletes had personality traits at similar levels, and at the same time, different from non-training people."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

In this essay I take up the issue of sport and art. The craftsmanship in combat sports determines that warrior creates a work of art (Martial Arts). Similarly, every sport can be considered as the art of movement. But this is not the understanding of the relationship between sport and art. The problem is whether the Olympic Game itself (in the singular) can be recognized as a separate art in analogy to opera seria. The Olympic Game is art because it is a theatricalization of the drama of the life of a man of peace.\nMethod. In recognizing the Olympic Game as a work of art, the semiological and axiological criterion of symbolic culture was\nused. The Olympic Games of the naive phase – the utopian philosophy of Olympism – were compared to the realistic-objective phase – theoretically probable.\nResults. It has been shown that the Olympic Game is a ritual stadium event that symbolizes the idea of a cyclical rebirth of life. The sports agonism itself, which ends in reconciliation in friendship, symbolizes Olympic peace. For these two reasons, the stadium Olympics can be considered a work of art theatrum olympicum. The difference between the truce as a state of warlessness in ancient Olympia and the Olympic peace was explained.\nConclusion. There is no axionormative continuity in the making of the art of the Olympic Games. The Olympic Game is a work of art telling about the misfortune of war, which is overcome not by the state of no-war (ekecheiria), but by a completely real conversion to the path of a decent life. The law of friendship is not confirmed when haters and supporters of war crimes infiltrate the stadium. The real destroyer of sports law, due to his moral disability, cannot have access to the sign reality of the Olympic Games."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The study sample consisted of 41 trained men aged 18–24. The ST-ISO group (n = 17) performed three five-second sets of the maximal voluntary back squat while pushing on an immovable bar and two sets of five repetitions of a slow-tempo (5-0-5-0) body squat immediately after isometry with a 2-m rest interval. The ISO (n = 14) group only performed isometric squats, and the control group (CG; n = 10) performed a 5-min treadmill run at 6 km/h. The countermovement jump (CMJ) height results were analyzed from the baseline and then at 3, 5, 7, and 9 min after the PAPE protocols. The statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RM-ANOVA revealed differences in the group-minute interaction (F = 2.70; p = 0.0083; η2 = 0.1243), and post-hoc tests demonstrated a significant decrease in CMJ after 5 min in the ISO group (p < 0.0446). The performance of the ST-ISO group markedly decreased in the 3rd and 7th min after PAPE (p = 0.0137; p = 0.0424, respectively), though it improved significantly in the final minute (p < 0.0030). Chi-squared analysis revealed that the ST-ISO group peaked more frequently in the 9th min (X2 = 17.97; p = 0.0214). However, CMJ height improvement did not differ between the PAPE protocols, thus it was close to statistical significance (t = −1.82; p = 0.07; ES = 0.7). The ST-ISO protocol provided jump enhancement, though the deterioration observed in the first minutes after the protocols suggest the rest period after activity requires attention, and the methods need to be individualized."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

In this context, the targeted application of these interventions is deemed as crucial as assessing their overall effectiveness. The aim of this study was to characterize the patient profile who benefited most from immersive virtual reality (VR) therapy.\nMethods\nBased on the results from the previous randomized controlled trial study, we employed an exploratory study design to determine the factors associated with the most significant mental health improvement. A secondary analysis was conducted on a sample of 83 participants, with further analysis of participants with elevated depression symptoms, as indicated by a score of > 10 on the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30). Both groups participated in a similar post-stroke rehabilitation program; however, the experimental group also received additional VR therapy through an immersive VR garden intervention. The GDS-30 was used to assess mood and depressive symptoms, and sociodemographic, cognitive status as well as stroke-related variables were considered as potential factors.\nResults\nIn both the experimental (mean change 5.3) and control groups (mean change 2.8), interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms, with a more pronounced difference in the experimental group (p < 0.05). When examining gender differences, women exhibited greater improvement in the GDS, with mean between-group differences of 5.0 for the total sample and 6.0 for those with elevated depressive symptoms. Sociodemographic factors, cognitive status, and time from stroke were not found to be factors that alter the effectiveness of VR therapy.\nConclusions\nWhile VR therapy as an adjunctive treatment for post-stroke rehabilitation seems especially effective for women with elevated depressive symptoms, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the study’s small experimental group size. Traditional methods showed reduced effectiveness in women compared to men; thus, developing technologically advanced and gender-specific approaches can lead to more tailored therapy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

It can be defined as the phenomenon of visiting places known from the screen. None of the existing set-jetting researches has applied the contingent valuation method yet. The existing research on set-jetting consists mostly of studies concerning on mapping the phenomenon. The aim of this paper is the knowledge about the economic value of railway bridge over Pilchowice Lake which is a part of the Bóbr Valley Railway ‘Bobertalbahn’.\nMaterial and Methods: The object of the research was a railroad bridge over the Pilchowice Lake located in Poland, in Lower Silesia province, Lwówecki district, Wleń commune (the examined bridge was a shooting location of many films). The paper uses a contingent valuation method (CVM) with willingness to pay (WTP) option, supported by literature studies conducted by the authors. Data was collected with a questionnaire prepared by the authors in an online form in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic. The search was conducted from August to December 2020.\nResults: The economic value of the railway bridge over the Pilchowice Lake totalled almost PLN 2.6 million (EUR 0.6 million) in 2019 and PLN 111.4 million (EUR 24 million) in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic.  \nConclusions: Set-jetting increased tourist traffic 3 times, as well as the economic value of the Bóbr Valley Railway including the railroad bridge over Pilchowice Lake. In addition, it was found that increased WTP does not depend on age, education level or income level. Authors’ contribution is the first ever study during the Covid-19 pandemic of an unused railway bridge gathering the knowledge about its economic value."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The study assessed the impact of EU funds on sustainable tourism in the Lower Silesian region of Poland in theyears 2014-2019. Material and methods. A literature review and the following research methods were used in the study: logicalanalysis and construction, as well as documentary and statistical analyses. A database was compiled containing statistical dataon implemented tourism projects subsidized with EU funds in municipalities of Lower Silesia. Each project was then assignedto one of sustainable tourism sections in accordance with the Global Sustainable Tourism Council Destination Criteria. Statis-tical analysis included structure analysis, basic statistics, and the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test and post-hoc test. Results. TheKruskal-Wallis test results (H = 20.01 for project values, and H = 23.34 for the amount of EU funding) and the probability level(p = 0.001) demonstrated that project expenditures on tourism in each sustainable tourism section differed significantly. Themultiple comparisons test (post-hoc test) revealed statistically significant differences between the values of projects implement-ed in the sections of cultural sustainability and sustainable management (p = 0.009), cultural sustainability and environmen-tal sustainability (p = 0.009), socio-economic sustainability and sustainable management (p = 0.009), and socio-economicsustainability and environmental sustainability (p = 0.008). In terms of the amount of EU funding, statistically significantdifferences were found between cultural sustainability and environmental sustainability (p = 0.001), and socio-economic sus-tainability and environmental sustainability (p = 0.001). Conclusions. The allocation of EU funds for tourism projects did notcontribute to the implementation of sustainable tourism. In the next EU programming period, i.e. 2021-2027, a more sustaina-ble allocation of funds for tourism projects should be pursued. There is a clear need to increase the number and value of tourismprojects implemented in the area of environmental sustainability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de0a","uid":"baUDwEr8mzwEHkagRyl8Vhg","uuid":"8395c169-9930-4090-acb2-320b9203f249","name":"Uniwersytet WSB Merito we Wrocławiu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70920f878c28a04738f37a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de0a","parentUuid":"8395c169-9930-4090-acb2-320b9203f249","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de0a","rootUuid":"8395c169-9930-4090-acb2-320b9203f249","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The dependence between the indicators was analyzed using the regression equation, Shapiro-Wilk test. Research results demonstrate that the increase in the inflow and outflow of foreign direct investments leads to an increase in the size of the shadow economy without a time lag in Ukraine, Poland, Slovenia, Romania, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and with a time lag of 1 year in Slovakia and Hungary. The largest impact on the size of the shadow economy is made by the volume of inflow and outflow of direct foreign investments, while the volume of portfolio investments has a less significant effect. Consequently, it was concluded that the processes of inflow and outflow of direct foreign investments require enhanced control by specialized state executive bodies given the scale of their potential destabilizing impact on the macroeconomic stability of the country."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The VMR may provide additional functional information on vitamin D metabolism in athletes. Therefore, the main objective of the current study was to evaluate 25-(OH)DF, bioavailable 25-(OH)D (25-(OH)DB), VMR, and psychophysical stress markers during different training periods over a half-season. The second aim was to assess the association between vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), total and free 25-(OH)D, VMRs, and psychophysical stress markers in professional football players. Moreover, we examined the relationship between 25-(OH)D3 and vitamin D metabolites (24,25-(OH)2D3, 3-epi-25-(OH)D3) to determine if training loads in different training periods influenced the vitamin D metabolome.\n\nMethods: Twenty professional football players were tested at six different time points across half a year (V1—June; V2—July; V3—August; V4—October; V5—December; V6—January).\n\nResults: Analyses indicated a significant seasonal rhythm for VDBP, and total 25-(OH)D (25-(OH)DT), 25-(OH)DB, 24,25-(OH)2D3, 3-epi-25-(OH)D3, 25-(OH)D3:24,25-(OH)2D3, and 24,25-(OH)2D3:25-(OH)D3 VMRs throughout the training period. No correlation was detected between 25-(OH)DT, 25-(OH)DB, 25-(OH)DF, vitamin D metabolites, VMRs, VDBP, and ferritin, liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase [AST] and alanine transaminase [ALT]), creatine kinase (CK), cortisol, testosterone, and testosterone-to-cortisol ratio (T/C) in each period (V1-V6). However, there was a strong statistically significant correlation between 25-(OH)D3 and 24,25-(OH)D3 in each training period.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, a seasonal rhythm was present for VDBP, 25-(OH)DT, 25-(OH)DB, vitamin D metabolites (24,25-(OH)2D3, 3-epi-25-(OH)D3), and VMRs (25-(OH)D3:24,25-(OH)2D3, 25-(OH)D3:3-epi-25-(OH)D3). However, no rhythm was detected for 25-(OH)DF and markers of psychophysical stress (ferritin, liver enzymes, CK, testosterone, cortisol, and T/C ratio). Moreover, the relationships between free and total 25-(OH)D with psychophysical stress markers did not demonstrate the superiority of free over total measurements. Furthermore, training loads in different training periods did not affect resting vitamin D metabolite concentrations in football players."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Sixty women with depressive symptoms were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Both groups received eight (twice a week for four weeks) low-intensity general fitness training sessions. The IVR group (n = 30) received eight additional VR-based relaxation sessions, whereas the control group (n = 30) received eight group relaxation. As outcome measures, the geriatric depression scale (GDS; primary) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; secondary) were administered before and after the interventions. The protocol was registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov PRS database (Registration number: NCT05285501). Patients receiving IVR therapy exhibited a greater significant reduction in the GDS (adjusted mean post-difference of 4.10; 95% CI = 2.27–5.93) and HADS (2.95; 95% CI = 0.98–4.92) scores than those receiving the control intervention.

Winter should not be a season in which physical activity is abandoned. Previous studies indicate that reducing the daily level of physical activity in adults has a negative impact on their motor proficiency and respiratory endurance, which subsequently translates into diminished quality of life. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of winter outdoor physical activity on somatic parameters, body composition, and motor performance of adult men (age 45.4 ± 5.9 years) involved in regular physical activity (physically active PA, n = 31) during the winter season (study group) compared to the control group of physically inactive men (PI, n = 22). Somatic parameters and selected parameters of motor fitness (Eurofit for Adults) were measured in both groups twice, at the beginning (pre) and at the end (post) of the winter season. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures and a post hoc LSD test were performed to evaluate the difference between the mean parameter values. In the PA group, a decrease in body fat mass, waist circumference, and abdominal obesity indicators, as well as an increase in skeletal muscle mass were confirmed. Improvements in motor performance parameters, i.e., flexibility, the speed of upper limb movements, hand and forearm muscle grip strength, the strength of the lower part of the torso, and cardiorespiratory endurance were also observed. Regular physical activity in the open air during the winter brings measurable health benefits, positively influencing the body composition and motor efficiency of adult men."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

People with mobility impairments, whether in wheelchairs or on crutches, face a variety of impediments to urban infrastructure on a daily basis, both within their own home and in their immediate surroundings.

The home modifications improve functioning and decrease dependence, impact on general sensation, participation, and higher self-assessment of health. Housing adaptations were identified as one of the ten most promising “preventive interventions” for older people with physical disabilities. Adapting a home to the needs of people with mobility impairments requires an individual approach and comprehensive approach. Interdisciplinary cooperation among specialists from various scientific fields: technical, medical, and social – significantly increases the effectiveness projects. Occupational therapists play a key role in helping patients and their families to plan a safe, functional and comfortable home environment, supporting home healthcare services.

Zdrowie fizyczne jak również psychiczne jest bardzo istotne w życiu kobiet. Istnieje wiele czynników\ni działań wpływających na stan psychofizyczny kobiet. W ostatnim czasie odnotowuje się wzrost zachorowań\nna depresję w Polsce i na świecie. Wykazano także, że występowanie objawów depresyjnych jest związana\nz małą aktywnością fizyczną. Zatem rozpoczęcie aktywności fizycznej może prowadzić do złagodzenia\nistniejących już symptomów i zapobiegać ich powstawaniu w przyszłości. Wśród licznych dostępnych dla\nkobiet form aktywności fizycznej są zajęcia prowadzone w środowisku wodnym. Dlatego też celem pracy\nbyła analiza stanu psychofizycznego kobiet podejmujących regularną (2 razy w tygodniu) aktywność\nfizyczną w wodzie na zajęciach Aqua Fitness.\nMateriał i metody. W projekcie przebadano 30 kobiet, średnia wieku 46,9 (±13,8), spełniających kryteria\nwłączenia: brak przeciwwskazań do aktywności fizycznej w wodzie, zgoda lekarza rodzinnego do udziału\nw zajęciach, pisemna zgoda badanych kobiet, regularne uczestnictwo w zajęciach przez okres 3 miesięcy.\nDo badań wykorzystano: własną ankietę badawczą, Test Fullerton, Kwestionariusz Zdrowia Pacjenta (PHQ-\n9), Skalę Oceny i Jakości Życia (WHOQOL-BREF), Skalę Odczuwanego Stresu (PSS-10), Skalę Satysfakcji\nz Życia (SWLS).\nBadania wykonano w dwóch punktach pomiarowych: przed rozpoczęciem regularnych treningów (2 razy\nw tygodniu Aqua Fitnessu) (T1) i po trzech miesiącach regularnych zajęć na basenie (T2).\nWyniki. W badanej grupie kobiet zgłaszającej się na zajęcia z Aqua fitness u 60% odnotowano przeciętny\ni wysoki poziom odczuwanego stresu, a u 63% obniżony nastrój. W badaniach początkowych średni poziom\nstresu wyniósł 5,44 (±1,5) a średni poziom nastroju natomiast wyniósł 6,27 (±4,3), co wskazuje na przeciętne\nnatężenie stresu i występowanie łagodnych objawów depresji.

An increase in the average life expectancy constitutes one of the greatest achievements of humanity, and at the\nsame time a serious challenge for modern health protection and social care systems. The main aim of the work is to investigate quality of life and risk of falls.\nMethods. Forty-four people (30 females and 14 males) aged 63 to 99 (average: 83.2 ± 7.2), recruited from two local nursing\nhomes, participated in the study. To assess the risk of falling, the short-form version of FallScreen (physiological profile assessment, Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute) was used. To assess QoL (quality of life), the Polish version of the SF-36 questionnaire in its standard version was used.\nResults. It was indicated that in the year preceding the study, nearly 60% of participants fell; 32% (n = 14) fell once and 27%\n(n = 12) fell two or more times. Occurrence of chronic diseases and taking at least three medications were reported by more\nthan 80% of the seniors. The Results section presents the components of the physical and mental dimensions of the self-assessment of the quality of life of the participants of the study. The average index of quality of life among the studied people was 94.3 points, which is 55.2% of the maximum score.\nConclusions. The dominating risk factor for falls, as established in the nursing home residents against the Physiological Profile\nAssessment (PPA) scale, consisted in slower reaction to a stimulus; its average value exceeding by threefold the reference\nvalue for healthy individuals of similar age."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This lesion is regarded as a high risk of possible amputation, which is engendering enormous clinical, economic, and social costs. We discuss some imaging modalities used for diabetic foot ulcer examination, showing that some of them as, e.g., MRI or CT are mostly used in advanced stages to have deeper insight into the tissue damage. Some other techniques as ultrasound imaging and elastography require in-contact examination. Non-contact methods as advanced optical technique of hyperspectral imaging are not yet popular, require special equipment and knowledge in image analysis. Therefore, other monitoring modalities should be proposed that are cheaper, easy to use, do not require advanced training, and can be operated by the patient himself.\nPredictive, preventive, and personalized approach may ensure more effective patient care, thus avoiding irreversible damage and resulting in better outcomes. Prediction should be directed towards detection of diabetes mellitus onset and monitoring of disease complications. Preventive measures should serve to prevent the occurrence of the disease, and in patients should prevent possible complications. In the event of complications, they should prevent irreversible tissue changes, and in the case of foot ulcer, they should prevent amputation.\nTo ensure the above assumptions, proper diagnostic method should be applied, which is relatively cheap, sensitive, repeatable, does not require complicated apparatus, and is suitable for telemonitoring. In our opinion, thermovision recording may be very useful for this goal, especially because of the technological development offering better and better infrared cameras, also for personal use as an accessory transforming personal smartphone into a powerful thermal infrared camera. In this chapter some thermal imaging application for foot ulcer diagnosis, are discussed, including methods of analysis based on the use of artificial intelligence algorithms. Examples of our preliminary study on diabetes suffering patients and non-diabetic subjects, are also included showing the possible predictors that may be concluded from analysis of thermal images.\nRecommendations are proposed encompassing various aspects of prediction, prevention, and personalization depending on the stage of the disease that can help to avoid the wrests complication as fully developed ulceration, trophic changes and tissue necrosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Yet, sex-based performance dependency has not\nbeen taken into consideration by most of the researchers evaluating swimming start.\nTherefore, the purpose of this research was to determine the effect of sex\nheterogeneity on the spatiotemporal characteristics of swimming start by\ninvestigating the determinants of its performance. A total of fifty-two internationallevel\nswimmers (thirty females and twenty-two males) performed three repetitions of\nthe kick-start up to the 15-m mark. During trials, data were collected using video\ncameras and instrumented starting block. To search for evidence of differences\nbetween the two groups, the one-way ANOVA was conducted. Pearson’s\ncorrelation coefficients were calculated between measurements widely used to\ndescribe overall starting performance and selected kinematical variables of\nswimming start. A sex effect was exposed for temporal variables describing all\nswimming start phases (p ≤ 0.015). Male swimmers, by spending less time during\nthe push-off from the starting block (p = 0.002; ηp\n2 = 0.18), reaching higher take-off\nvelocity (p < 0.001; ηp\n2 = 0.29), traveling longer distances during flight (p < 0.001; ηp\n2 =\n0.40), and swimming faster in the water phase (p < 0.001; ηp\n2 = 0.40), took starting\nadvantage over their female counterparts. Consequently, performance measures such\nas 5-m, 10-m, and 15-m start times indicated that male participants were faster than\nfemales (p < 0.001; ηp\n2 ≥ 0.40). Only in the group of male swimmers a significant\ncorrelation between variables describing overall starting performance (5-m, 10-m, and\n15-m times), and variables commonly highlighted as starting performance determining\nfactors (block phase duration, take-off horizontal velocity, and flight distance) was\nfound. The current study shows that the spatiotemporal variables of swimming start,\nthe relation between them as well as overall starting performance, vary by sex.\nConsequently, the requirement of sex factor and its heterogeneity effect should be\nincluded not only in detailed characteristics of separate variables but also in all\napproaches undertaken. Those findings seem to play a crucial role mainly in\nswimming start evaluations in post-pubertal age groups of swimmers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

In addition, the entire race underwent a unique kinematic analysis, particularly emphasizing the maximum running velocity and its related factors. It was possible due the application of the new Stuhec software. The data were provided by LAVEG’S advanced laser measurement technology based on positional data with a high spatiotemporal resolution. The maximum velocity phase is the most critical determinant of the final race time. Bolt completed two phases in this world-record 100 m sprint: acceleration and top velocity. The borderline between these phases reached the highest velocity of 12.32 m/s on a 52 m run. He could keep the maximum velocity in five 10 m sections (50–100 m). The occurrence of functional asymmetry—the difference in step length between the left and right legs—was also noticed. Longer steps were taken with the left leg, almost over 80 m. From a practical point of view, new technologies (e.g., software) allow coaches and athletes to analyze the kinematic parameters of sprinting even more precisely and in detail. They must take into account precise changes in the course of maximum speed and the parameters determining it which are step length and frequency. Based on such an analysis, it is possible to modify the training process aimed at increasing the potential, both maximum speed and the supporting factors of strength and power. This must be conditioned by the appropriate selection of training measures shaping the abovementioned motor skills and parameters describing the optimal sprinting technique."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

However, the growth time series characteristics of elite tennis athletes are unclear.\nObjective\nThis study aims to examine the historical career ranking changes of elite players and provide valuable insights for aspiring young players looking to achieve success in the sport. At the same time, it is of great significance for the efficient and sustainable cultivation of Chinese tennis players.\nMethods\nData on the rankings of 202 players were analyzed, Spearman and Pearson correlations were employed to investigate the association between ranking and time-use patterns. The variance test was utilized to compare disparities in time characteristics of the ranking, with a statistical significance level of p<0.05.\nResults\nThere was a significant correlation between the time of entering the professional tournament ranking system and the ranking, top 100 time, top 100 age, and age of starting tennis. Top 50 ATP players are earlier than those ranked 51–100. There was a significant difference between the age of starting tennis and the time to top 10 among the ATP and WTA players. Chinese female players showed no significant differences compared to their global Top 10 counterparts in terms of time-to-success characteristics.\nConclusion\nThe elite tennis players who achieve success typically start playing and competing in the sport at a young age, with professional competition often commencing around 18 years of age. Notably, these players frequently attain high rankings before reaching the age of 20. Furthermore, top 10 ATP male players tend to start tennis at an earlier age and require a shorter time to achieve a top 10 ranking compared with WTA female players."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

In Poland, 93.75% of children exhibited no weekly physical effort at the level of moderate to vigorous PA. In the Czech Republic, 69.44% of children engaged in PA lasting at least 60 min per day, or at least 1 day weekly. Physically active children engaging in more frequent effort, at least 60 min daily, reported higher physical performance (rho = 0.41), higher energy levels (rho = 0.41), and less mood disturbance (rho = −0.31).

Therefore, the objective of this article is the most general conclusion (knowledge) resulting from synthetic reflection on the effects of transformation of competition formula in karate in the 21st century.\nMaterial & Methods: The desk research method was used. Resources concerning contemporary competition formula in karate were queried, and the analysed resources were related to the existing division of kumite systems. Because the text presents the results of theoretical research, it was published in the form of an original work.\nResults: The World Karate Federation (WKF) semi contact competition is the most popular. There has been no change (in relation to the 20th century) in knockdown competition, which still occurs only within kyokushin karate. In contrast, the karate combat (KC) organisation dominates the full contact formula. Furthermore, it is noticed that the mix fighting formula has been abandoned in karate to favour performances by karatekas in neo gladiatorial organisations.\nConclusions: Trends of karate are evident nowadays. The semi contact formula is accepted as an Olympic sport, so it meets the criteria of development in line with the humanistic assumptions of the creator of these martial arts. The knockdown formula, on the other hand, is stabilised in kyokushin karate. And the full contact formula dominates through KC. The mix fighting formula in karate, by contrast, has been abandoned in favour of neo gladiator organisations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

A comparative study of two structurally different anaerobic tests was performed to reach the goal. The study was designed as a non-randomized, controlled before-and-after trial. Fourteen female soccer players (FSP) and twelve untrained girls (UNT) participated in the study. During that time, all participants were subjected to school’s physical education classes and the FSP additionally participated in regular soccer training. The anaerobic performance was evaluated twice, within 8-weeks period, using the traditional Wingate test (WAnT) and the RAST. A significant increase in the anaerobic performance of the FSP was noted (p < 0.05). In both tests peak, average, and relative power were significantly improved (p < 0.005). Nevertheless, strong, statistically significant (p < 0.05) correlation coefficients (0.50 < r < 0.70) were found for pre-training measurements between the WAnT and the RAST power parameters in absolute values. In UNT group significant improvement was found in peak, average and min power (p < 0.05) in the RAST. The improvement in anaerobic performance after training along with the strong correlation noted between the WAnT and the RAST power parameters prove the usefulness of the RAST in assessing anaerobic capacity in female youth athletes. Its simplicity encourages its use in monitoring anaerobic capacity in both trained and untrained girls."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Pearson\ncorrelations were calculated between the strength and power variables, both in absolute terms and relative to\nbody weight. Linear regression analysis was performed with the strength indicators as independent variables and\npower as the dependent variables. 1RM BSQ linked to PP (r=0.50; p<0.01).

The project identified all World Championships and Olympic Games medallists, resulting in 244 men’s matches being analyzed. Three time periods were considered based on the ball used, including the 38 mm celluloid ball, 40 mm celluloid ball, and 40 mm plastic ball. Differences in the level structure, depending on the observation period, were assessed using the chi-squared test of independence. The Pearson contingency coefficient was calculated, and multiple comparisons were made. The research showed that the use of combinations changed slightly with changes in ball size and material. The first three strokes were very important in all periods. However, the importance of serves as direct scoring strokes decreased. These findings may be related to changes in the size and material used for ball production. The most winning serves in the game of the top men were side-spin forehand serves, which were also used most often during 3rd-ball-attack winning combinations. The number of actions won directly with a return, and in the return-counterattack combination, accounted for, and still constitute, about 30%, with an increasing number of backhand flicks. The research also showed an increase in the use of backhand strokes compared to forehand strokes. These findings should be considered when creating basic goals in table tennis training plans."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Twenty U18 players were divided into two groups (SEP1 and SEP2) performing six 30 s and 45 s bouts of SSG (work-to-rest ratio 1:4) on a 10 by 15 m field. ETL was characterized by the total distance covered, Player Load, the total number of accelerations/decelerations, and their relative values (per minute). Significant overall decreases in the ETL parameter values across six repetitions in both SSG groups were observed relative to the measurement in the first set beginning in 3rd (SEP1) or 4th (SEP2) repetitions. Significant greater decreases in Player Load (F(5.90) = 2.99, p < 0.05, η P2 = 0.14), Player Load per minute (F(5,90) = 11.32, p < 0.001, η P2 = 0.39), total distance per minute (F(3.43,61.73) = 7.72, p < 0.001, η P2 = 0.30) and accelerations per minute (F(5,90) = 2.59, p < 0.05, η P2 = 0.13) were observed in the 30-s games than in the 45-s games. In conclusion, the use of SSGs in SEP training is associated with a decrease in the effectiveness of physical work performed across repetitions. In practice, due to the decrease in the measured ETL indicators already in the 3rd or 4th repetition (especially in the SEP1 group), the work-to-rest ratio could be increased from the applied 1:4 to 1:6."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Nonetheless, cancer patients of all ages are susceptible to such risks. Both cancer and its treatments contribute to significant risk factors for disturbances in walking and falls, encompassing muscle weakness, impaired balance, reduced proprioception, cognitive impairment, and functional limitations. Aim: to assess walking speed and the risk of falls among patients undergoing surgery for the most common malignancies: breast (BU), lung (P), colorectal (DS), and reproductive organs (G). Material and Methods: An observational study was conducted using a cohort design. A total of 176 individuals participated in the study, including 139 cancer patients, who were divided into four groups: BU (N = 30), P (N = 35), DS (N = 35), and G (N = 39), as well as 37 healthy volunteers in the control group (C, N = 37). All participants underwent an assessment of walking speed using BTS G-WALK® and an evaluation of the number of falls and the risk of falling using a Fall Control Card. Results: There was a significant decrease in walking speed after surgery compared to the time before surgery, from 2.7% in the BU group, through 9.3% in the P group, and 19.2% in the DS group, to 30.0% in the G group. At the same time, for groups G and DS, the average walking speed fell below 1.0 m/s, amounting to 0.84 m/s and 0.97 m/s, respectively, in the measurement after the surgery and 0.95 m/s and 1.0 m/s in the follow-up measurement. Falling occurred in all the groups except for the BU group. The created logistic regression model showed that increasing the walking speed measured after the procedure (study 2) by 1 m/s reduces the risk of falling by approximately 500 times (OR = 0.002). Limitations in daily activity were observed in the follow-up examination (study 3) in 75% of patients. Conclusions: Surgical intervention has an impact on walking speed, and being part of the study group influences the risk of falling.

A set of anthropometric variables was used to predict swimming speed in the four swimming strokes and medley.\nResults: A multiplicative model with allometric body size components was used to identify the demographic and anthropometric predictors of swimming speed. Trunk height and waist circumference were the only variables significantly different among swimming strokes (p < 0.05). Associations between swimming speed and arm length were similar in breaststroke and medley, and in freestyle, backstroke and butterfly (R2 = 60.9%). The model retained as swimming speed predictors the age2, upper body circumference, hand breadth, waist circumference, and subscapular skinfold thickness (these last two had negative associations).\nConclusion: All these predictors were common to all four swim strokes and medley. Arm length was also retained as a significant predictor, but this one varied significantly between the four different swim strokes and medley. These findings highlight the importance of having a “V-shape” trunk, longer upper limbs, and large hands as predictors of swimming performance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Less is known about the current methods used in an ecological context and the extent to which evidence-based considerations are applied. Knowledge of current practices might also enable to identify pitfalls in successful implementation and/or deficiencies in the communication of scientific knowledge. Thus, the aim of this study was to quantify and compare the load that players experience in an ecological context during drills that are frequently used, and in which there is an intention to improve the players’ physical capacities. Therefore, a retrospective observational cohort study was conducted over a 14-month period, analyzing 9 load measures during training drills of 39 players of a team competing in the highest Swiss league. The load experienced by players was statistically significant different between the assessed drill categories for each load measure (all p < .001). This indicates different drills provide different stimuli. HIIT drills proved to be a more powerful tool of getting players to cover distances at high-speed and to spend time at an intensity ≥90% HRmax compared to sided games. The sprint distance of players was very low in all sided games and in most cases also in HIIT drills, in the latter the players also hardly performed any deceleration. In small goal-oriented sided games, players covered a greater distance per minute when outside floaters were present. Particularly regarding an improvement of the players’ aerobic capacity, the present data emphasize the relevance for coaches to ensure an appropriate exposure. In general, the importance of individual load management in professional soccer is highlighted."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

However, it is not clear how these parameters are relevant for athletes performing on a less demanding sport level as academic competitions. To help coaches and selectors working on this level, we have explored anthropometric variables and body composition in 68 academic athletes: 26 sprinters, 22 middle distance runners, and 20 long distance runners. Sprinters have a more massive body shape, shorter lower legs in relation to the length of the thigh, broader shoulders and narrower hips, greater musculature and cellular mass. A slender figure, a longer shin, and the greatest subcutaneous fat and extracellular mass characterize long-distance runners. Middle-distance runners are the slimmest, and have a narrow trunk and little subcutaneous fat. Sprinters and long-distance runners are mesomorphic, while middle-distance runners present more mixed mesomorph-ectomorph type. The principal component analysis highlighted the importance of the overall size of the body, limbs musculature and the length of the lower limb together with its segments, and also body fatness. This approach emphasized the morphological distinctiveness of runners at particular distances and allows the use of somatic features as predictors of running performance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Under such conditions of physical stress, significant damage to muscle cells occurs, greater than in typically aerobic efforts. Among the strongest stimuli causing these changes are the mechanical and metabolic stresses associated with the physiological cost of exercise, which can be exacerbated when working at elevated ambient temperatures. The aim of our research was to obtain knowledge about the relationship between the effect of a special fitness test conducted at two different ambient temperatures and the level of heat stress in judokas.\n\nMaterial and Methods: The study was carried out among a group of 15 professional judo athletes aged 20.65 ±2.03 years with an average aerobic capacity level. The research protocol consisted of two main parts with separate tasks. Part one was the preliminary study (stage I, II and III), and part two was the main study (stage IV and V). The performance tests were conducted during the starting period and took place in a thermoclimatic chamber and an air-conditioned laboratory. In Stage I, selected anthropometric and circulatory indicators were measured. Stage II involved the male subjects performing an exercise test assessing anaerobic and aerobic capacity with the lower limbs (LL) and after seven days with the upper extremities (AA) (stage III). The Wingate test for lower limbs (LL) and upper limbs (AA) was used to assess anaerobic capacity indices. After a minimum of 2h after completing the Wingate Test, the subjects took a test to assess aerobic capacity. To assess aerobic capacity, a direct method was used – a test with gradually increasing load performed on a cycloergometer to refusal to continue due to extreme fatigue. The test determined physiological indicators at the level of the second ventilation threshold (VT2) and at the maximum level (VO2max). In the main study (stage IV and V), half of the male subjects performed 5 restrictive pulse exercise sequences on a foot cycloergometer and hand cycloergometer in a thermoclimatic chamber at 21 ±0.5°C (stage IV) and the other half at 31 ±0.5°C (stage V), relative humidity 50% ±5%. After the seven days the subjects rejoined stages IV and V. This time, the first group of subjects performed the exercise at 31 ±0.5°C and the second half at 21 ±0.5°C. The interval effort was characterized by pulsatile, alternating, time-varying loading of the upper and lower extremities during anaerobic exercise series punctuated by 15-minute rest intervals.\n\nResults: In the Wingate test with the lower extremities, the maximum anaerobic power (RPP) was 12.12 ±0.87 W ∙ kg−1, and with the upper extremities it was 7.00 ±0.56 W ∙ kg−1. Total work (TW) in the test with the lower extremities was 21.85 ±4.26 kJ and with the upper extremities 13.36 ±2.50 kJ. The result of VO2max measurement for the lower limbs averaged 43.23 ±7.79 ml.kg−1 ∙ min−1, and for the upper limbs 37.19 ±5.26 ml.kg−1 ∙ min−1. HRmax recorded in the graded test for the lower limbs averaged 185 ±8.19 bpm and for the test for the lower limbs: 183 ±8.43 bpm. The time to reach VT2 averaged 11.50 ±3.09 min for the lower extremities and 8.32 ±2.99 min for the upper extremities. At the second ventilation threshold, the heart rate of contraction (HRVT2) was 168 ±8.42 bpm (LL) and 162 ±8.75 bpm (AA). The percentage of oxygen uptake at the second ventilation threshold (%VO2max) was 77.68 ±9.61% (LL) and 71.88 ±11.65% (AA), respectively. As a result of exercise dehydration at 21°C and 31°C, there was a statistically significant reduction in body weight (p<0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the BM values recorded after a series of exercise at 21°C and 31°C. PSI and CHSI values were statistically significantly higher for exercise performed at 31°C.\n\nConclusions: Different ambient thermal conditions do not affect the volume of work performed in pulsatile anaerobic exercise, which does not support the view represented by some researchers about the effect of ambient temperature on anaerobic capacity. The tested athletes tolerated the thermal load well and their subjective assessment of the strenuousness of the work, did not differ in the ambient temperatures used. The greater weight loss, and thus dehydration, observed in athletes after exercise at elevated ambient temperatures may be related to a widening of their capillary network in both muscle and skin, influenced by years of training, which also increases the body's water percentage which promotes sweat transpiration. In order to increase the body's tolerance to heat and exercise stress, it is reasonable in professional judokas to conduct training under various ambient thermal conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The goal of the study was to analyse the attitudes towards moral values adopted by Polish physiotherapists. Eight basic moral values were enumerated, namely: professionalism, care, fairness, dignity, autonomy, responsibility, trust, and professional integrity. The chosen values were analysed taking into account the sex, age, education, work experience, workplace and the knowledge of moral rules included in the Code of Professional Ethics of the Physiotherapist of the Republic of Poland and/or in the Rules of Professional Ethics of Physiotherapists (the Polish Chamber of Physiotherapists).\nMethods. The study embraced 199 professionally active physiotherapists, with 5 surveys not filled in correctly, which left 194.\nResults. Variables such as sex (p < 0.001) and workplace (p < 0.016) differentiate the respondents significantly in the context\nof the studied values. Physiotherapists with longer working experience also declare attitudes more closely based on moral\nvalues than physiotherapists with shorter working experience (p = 0.021). With regard to the adopted attitudes towards values, vital differences between men and women can be observed. Women choose fairness (p < 0.001) whereas men choose the ethics of care (p = 0.619). Physiotherapists employed by non-public centres are more oriented towards autonomous decisions than physiotherapists employed by publicly financed centres (p = 0.048).\nConclusions. Numerous factors have been observed differentiating the attitudes of the respondents towards moral values.\nThe differences may evidence a lack of uniform professional culture which might in turn translate into limited respect on the part of society. The variables differentiating the group are modal, thanks to which a change in the moral attitudes of Polish physiotherapists is possible."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

A city determines the scale and directions of investments by making decisions about public investments. The result of investments is the creation of financial, economic, and social benefits. This article aims to understand how the structure and level of spending in Wroclaw was affected by hosting the UEFA European Football Championship 2012 (EURO 2012) between 2010 and 2014.\n\nMaterial & Methods:\n\nThe spatial scope of the analysis was limited to Wrocław, Poland. The time range of analysis was set for the years 2010-2014 and the field of research was related to the EURO 2012 football championship. The method used was deductive reasoning, appropriate for analytical thinking. Investment expenditure of the city was analysed.\n\nResults:\n\nHigher levels of investments in examined areas corresponded to higher the social needs in these fields. Most investments were made in public transport.

Factors such as the mass and length of the muscle, joint angle, type of contraction, and gender influence the magnitude of the muscle strength. The aim of this study was to compare the isometric strength of lower extremity extensors between the different knee extension angles (KEs) as well as between bilateral and unilateral conditions.\nMethods\nNineteen female students (age: 20.2 ± 0.6 years) and nineteen male students (age: 20.3 ± 0.7 years) participated in the study. The muscle strength was evaluated in CKC using the strain gauge dynamometer. The analysis included values of the maximum muscle strength normalized to body mass (MS/BM) for the six KEs of 80°, 70°, 60°, 50°, 40° and 30°.\nResults\n\nA significant main effect in the MS/BM values for the angle factor (p < 0.001) and condition factor (p < 0.001) was found. Moreover, there was a non-significant interaction effect between the angle factor and gender factor (p = 0.476) as well as between the condition factor and gender factor (p = 0.770). Comparisons showed significant differences in the MS/BM values between the six KEs (p < 0.001). Furthermore, significantly lower MS/BM values for bilateral conditions than unilateral conditions at the 30° KE were observed (p < 0.001).\nConclusion\nThe decrease in KE by 10° significantly increased the muscle strength of the lower extremity extensors. Gender did not affect the change in MS/BM values with the change in KE and conditions. Findings also revealed significant bilateral deficit, i.e., significantly a lower summed muscle strength during bilateral conditions than unilateral conditions. The study emphasized the importance of selecting the 30° KE as the optimal angle to assess the maximum strength developed in CKC."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Method: 13 female basketball players (17.12 ± 1.09 years; mean BW 58.17 kg ± 7.68 kg; mean BH 1.73 ± 0.11, BMI 19.53 ± 3.86) playing top Slovak junior league. The diagnosis of specific game reactions was carried out using a Y-shaped reaction agility test. The stimulus for the action effect was a light direction indicator and a video sequence. Decision-making style was assessed using the Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire (MDMQ). Results: The significance of the differences between offensive actions according to the type of stimulus was revealed by statistically significant differences between offensive reaction agility to a light stimulus and a stimulus with a contextual stimulus, and also in the case of defensive actions. Correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between offensive and defensive skills in the light stimulus, between the performance in offensive skills in the light stimulus, between the two types of defensive agility (light and video) and in the context stimulus, and a correlation between vigilance and both offensive activities was also found. Conclusion: The player's sensorimotor mechanisms are different depending on the type of stimulus, not on the type of actions, which leads to the conclusion that specific contextual information can lead to faster and more accurate decisions during the game 1:1 and improve the timing of action effects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The study included 25 younger (< 65 years) and 25 older (65 +) patients with cardiovascular disease who participated in virtual reality therapy to cope with anxiety and depression. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess anxiety and depressive disorders before and after intervention. Significant reductions in anxiety and depression scores after intervention were observed in both age-matched groups, and no significant differences were found between the younger and older participants. Further evaluation of patient age as a predictor of the effectiveness of psychological intervention in virtual reality did not show a significant effect of age on effectiveness in reducing anxiety and depressive disorders.

However, their effect has been studied primarily in the cortical bone, with vitamin D status being assessed mainly from the total 25(OH)D serum fraction. The study aimed to investigate the impact of vitamin D (total and free fraction) and iron status (i.e., serum ferritin or soluble transferrin receptor) and calcium intake (ADOS-Ca questionnaire) on lumbar cortical and trabecular bone. In a cohort of 113 male subjects (76 athletes, 37 non-athletes) aged 15–19, the lumbar spine status (Z-score, bone mineral apparent density (BMAD), and trabecular bone score (TBS)) was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Relationships between the examined micronutrients and bone health parameters were observed only in athletes. Free 25(OH)D was significantly (p < 0.001) correlated with Z-score and BMAD, while total 25(OH)D (p < 0.001) and iron status (ferritin, Fe stores; p < 0.01) correlated solely with BMAD. Free 25(OH)D and ferritin concentrations were the best determinants of bone status (R2 = 0.330; p < 0.001) and explained 25% and 7% of the BMAD variance, respectively. No relationships were found between the micronutrients and TBS. The results confirmed the positive influence of vitamin D and iron on cortical, but not trabecular, bone status solely in physically active subjects. In athletes, free 25(OH)D seems to be a superior indicator of bone health to a total 25(OH)D fraction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Impact of Intermittent Hypoxic Training on Aerobic Capacity and Biometric-Structural Indicators among Obese Women—A Pilot Study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Obesity, a common lifestyle-related condition, is correlated with factors like inadequate physical activity. Its connection to diverse health issues presents a significant challenge to healthcare. This pilot study investigated the effects of hypoxic training on aerobic capacity and biometric-structural indicators in obese women. The secondary objective was to determine the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of the planned research procedures and their potential for larger-scale implementation. Material and methods: Forty-one non-trained women with first-degree obesity were randomly assigned to even normobaric hypoxic training (H + E), normoxic training (E), passive exposure to hypoxia (H), and a control group (C). Training sessions were conducted three times a week for four weeks (12 training sessions). Body composition parameters were assessed, metabolic thresholds were determined, and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) was measured before and after interventions. Results: The results demonstrated that training in hypoxic conditions significantly affected somatic parameters, with the H + E group achieving the best outcomes in terms of weight reduction and improvements in body composition indicators (p < 0.001). Normoxic training also induced a positive impact on body weight and body composition, although the results were less significant compared to the H + E group (p < 0.001). Additionally, training in hypoxic conditions significantly improved the aerobic capacity among the participants (p < 0.001). The H + E group achieved the best results in enhancing respiratory endurance and oxygen consumption (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The results of this pilot study suggest, that hypoxic training can be effective for weight reduction and improving the aerobic capacity in obese women. Despite study limitations, these findings indicate that hypoxic training could be an innovative approach to address obesity and related conditions.

The muscle–tendon unit outcome measures on the dominant leg included muscle thickness, fascicle length (Lf), pennation angle (θp), and stiffness for the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), and vastus medialis muscle (VM) at baseline, immediately after repeated sprint cycling, and 1-h post-exercise.\n\nResults\nThe results showed an increase in muscle thickness and θp in RF, VL, and VM for both cadences from baseline to immediately after exercise. The Lf decreased in RF (both cadences), while stiffness decreased in RF, VL, and VM at optimal cadence, and in VL at 70% of optimal cadence from baseline to immediately after exercise.\n\nConclusion\nThe present study revealed that the alterations in muscle characteristics were more marked after repeated sprint cycling at optimal cadence compared with a lower cadence most likely as a result of higher load on the muscle–tendon unit at optimal cadence."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

body’s response to this type of combat is sparse. This study aims to assess the alterations\nin hormone levels and brain activity in elite kickboxers following an actual K1 bout and compare these changes\nwith those observed in a control group engaged in a simulated fight exercise with a punchbag. The study included\n100 male professional kickboxers, randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group (K1 fight) and a control\ngroup (simulated fight with a punchbag). Blood samples were obtained before and after exercise to evaluate\ntestosterone (T) and cortisol concentrations (C). Concurrently, brain activity was recorded using quantitative\nelectroencephalography (QEEG). After the activity in the experimental group mean testosterone level slightly,\nnon‑significantly decreased from 13.7 nmol/l to 12.4 nmol/l, while mean cortisol significantly (p < 0.001) increased\nfrom 313 to 570 nmol/l. In the control group after the exertion against a punchbag mean cortisol significantly\n(p < 0.001) increased from 334 to 452 nmol/l and testosterone increased non‑significantly, from 15.1 to 16.3 nmol/l.\nIn both groups, the testosterone/cortisol ratio (T/C ratio) showed significantly lower levels after the intervention\n(p < 0.001 and p < 0.032) in the experimental and control group respectively. The comparison of groups after\nexercise revealed significantly higher cortisol levels (experimental group x = 570 nmol/l; control group x = 452\nnmol/l) and a significantly lower T/C ratio (experimental group x = 2.7; control group x = 3.9), (p = 0.001) in\nthe experimental group. Significantly higher brain activity was found in selected leads after a bout (experimental\ngroup). Furthermore, in the experimental group, significant associations of weak to moderate strength were found\nbetween hormone fluctuations and selected areas of brain activity (p < 0.05). K1-format kickboxing induces a stress\nresponse, evident in the sharp changes in cortisol and testosterone levels. A notable observation was the inverse\ndirection of changes in both hormones.

The\nrelative reliability of the repeated test was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with 95%\nconfidence interval (95% CI). Next, the standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable change\n(MDC) were computed. Relative reliability of the repeated test for all analysed variables of ICC ranged from\n0.31 to 0.75. For four variables, ICC values were ca. 0.7, i.e., they can be considered as good. For four other\nvariables, ICC ranged from 0.41 to 0.54, with these values considered fair.

It was assumed that there is a relationship between physical fitness and postural defects. The purpose of this article was to verify the relationship between physical fitness and postural defects in boys aged 10 years.\nMaterial and Methods: Non-training boys (n = 60) aged 10 years were studied in two groups: healthy (n = 30); with postural defects (spine, shoulder blades, feet; n = 30). Basic somatic characteristics were transferred from school nurses' records. Physical fitness, on the other hand, was examined with the International Physical Fitness Test, which consists of eight trials: 50 m dash, standing broad jump,  long run 1000 m, hand grip; pull ups, 4x10  m shuttle  run, sit ups and bend trunk.\nResults: Statistically significant differences were noted between healthy children and children with defects – depending on the defect, the differences were in the forward trunk bend in standing, in the shuttle run in long-distance running and in the overhang on a bar. On the other hand, between children with defects – depending on the defect, the differences were in sit-ups from lying backwards, forward trunk bending in standing and in hanging on a bar.\nConclusions: It was found that in the study population, spinal defects affect the level of flexibility; shoulder defects affect the level of agility; foot defects affect the level of strength, relative arm strength and agility."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

From 1733 studies found, 34 were included.\nRESULTS: it was highlighted the necessity for forthcoming investigations to tackle the methodical restrictions and disparities in the domain.\nDISCUSSION: great diversity in intervention protocols was found. Incorporating evaluations of physical fitness in conjunction with cognitive evaluations can offer a more allencompassing comprehension of the impacts of combined interventions.

A total of 150 male handball athletes were tested before a national tournament, using squat, bench press, 30-m sprint, vertical jump, pull-ups and abdominal endurance testing. Correlation analysis was used to examine the potential relationship between fitness level and tournament ranking. The results revealed significant differences in fitness variables among different playing positions (p < 0.05), excepted abdominal endurance and vertical jump (p > 0.05). 1RM squad performance was associated with team rankings (r = 0.289, p < 0.05). For individual playing positions, bench press of backs correlate with rankings (r = 0.354, p < 0.05). For goalkeepers, ranking was significantly positively correlated with 30-m sprinting (r = 0.604, p < 0.05). No other correlations were found (p > 0.05). To conclude, fitness level is to some extent related to team ranking with higher ranked teams having better scores in some of the fitness tests for all playing positions. The key predictors of performance in sport vary from position to position and practitioners need to differentiate between them to organize strength and conditioning training more precisely. More specialized fitness tests are also needed to assess athletes' competition ability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The authors constructed a test involving a complex author’s kickboxing task that mirrored the competitive conditions during a sports fight. Forty-seven K-1 kickboxing Polish National Team members (37 men and 10 women) performed a specific series of strikes across three variants. The relationship between the speed of these complex movement tasks, performed under decision-making conditions, and the sports level of the kickboxers, was evaluated. Deciding to start or change an action in reaction to external stimuli significantly (p < 0.001) increased the total task completion time in the male and female subject groups. The time spent deciding to take action and the time spent on deciding on the action were not significantly different. Quick execution of complex tasks under decision-making conditions, such as selecting the appropriate technical and tactical action, can become a decisive factor in determining a sports result. Making decisions to start or change an action as a reaction to external stimuli significantly (p < 0.001) extended the total time of task execution in the studied group. However, the time spent deciding to start the action and the time devoted to deciding during the action did not differ significantly. Therefore, the tactical solution an athlete uses makes no difference, though they must perform it confidently and with minimal time loss."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Coraz silniej eksponuje się współpracę grupową i zespołową. W takim świecie umiejętności komunikowania się stają się dla człowieka podstawowe, a umiejętności perswazyjne szczególnie pożądane. Jednocześnie ogromny rozwój technologii informacyjnych ostatnich dekad stworzył erę „cywilizacji cyfrowej” z jej wielkimi możliwościami w zakresie komunikowania się, ale także ograniczeniami, czy wręcz niebezpieczeństwami.

Smart organization means converting resources, converging processes, implementing gamification mechanisms and streaming data. The main purpose of the article is to identify the functionality of available mobile applications used in the field of combat sports.\n\nMaterial and Methods: A review of the subject literature, presents the results of research in the field of digital maturity of organizations and the impact of smart tools on human physical activity 4.0 in organization 4.0. In the overview layer the authors refer to the results of their own research and literature sources dealing with these issues. Combat Sports Economics Z280.\n\nResults: Applications can be similar or completely different from each other, but each introduces something that is innovative for it and helps its everyday use. This is due to the fact that design companies outdo each other in inventing solutions aimed at gaining an advantage over the competition and attracting the customer with modernity and innovation. The analysed research confirms the strong impact of mobile applications and the use of these solutions in combat sports organizations.

However, there are limited studies presenting differences in injury prevalence and the risk of lower limb injuries in relation to the competitive level in male volleyball. Therefore, the main aim of the current study was to evaluate foot mobility (through navicular drop test) as an injury risk factor in volleyball players from different competitive levels. (2) Methods: The reliability and usefulness of navicular drop testing were initially assessed in test–retest procedures (based on a sample of eight participants and 16 feet measurements), with primary analyses conducted using foot measurements of the twelve top-level volleyball players (24 feet) and eighteen academic-level volleyball players (36 feet). The modified navicular drop test was conducted, and the feet were classified based on arch height, and injury prevalence was retrospectively assessed with a previously validated questionnaire. Chi-squared tests, receiver operating curves, and logistic regression were used as statistical methods. The navicular drop test was verified as a reliable tool by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (3.1) analysis. (3) Results: There were no significant differences in injury prevalence between academic- and top-level volleyball players, though there was a significant relationship between pronated foot and injury risk independent of competitive level. Generally, for both groups, thresholds above 10 mm of the navicular drop were predictors of lower limb injuries. The risk of injury if the foot was pronated ranged from 70% (academic level) to over 90% (top-level players). However, no statistically significant effect of competitive level on the chance of injury was observed. (4) Conclusions: Our study found a high prevalence of foot injuries independently of competitive level. There was a relationship between pronation of the foot and the risk of injury. However, the risk of lower limb injury was higher in pronated top-level players. Also, a navicular drop greater than 10 mm was an excellent predictor of injuries at both competitive levels."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Notably, 31 young adult soccer players (age: 18.79 ± 1.04 years) competing in the 3rd Czech division were monitored across the season. The weekly training load was measured using a GPS system as follows: total distance covered (TD), high-speed running distance (HSR), sprint running distance (SR), and acceleration and deceleration distance (ACDC). We found higher values in three out of four observed variables (HSR, SR, and ACDC, excluding TD) for starters compared to non-starters (p < 0.05), with small to moderate effect sizes (d = 0.40–0.49). Differences were observed especially in players who were fullbacks, offensive midfielders, and forwards. Moreover, the largest differences were found in training prior to a match day for HSR, SR, and ACDC (p < 0.05). Non-starters experienced lower weekly external loads in offensive player positions, predominantly in high-intensity variables, which are essential for their physical performance. It seems that non-starters may experience potential under-loading in the training process. Coaches and practitioners should be aware of this potential risk and find an appropriate method to compensate for load discrepancies, particularly in terms of high-intensity activities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The executive function test included three tasks, namely, inhibition, working memory, and shifting. The results showed significant improvement in inhibition and shifting in both groups, and the FJL group showed greater improvement in these aspects of EF compared to the control group. Additionally, in comparison to the control group, the FJL group exhibited increased functional connectivity within the frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions from the pre-test to the post-test. Notably, enhanced functional connectivity between the right superior temporal gyrus (posterior division) and left cerebellum 6 was identified in the FJL group and was associated with improved EF performance induced by football juggling learning. These findings shed light on the potential causal relationship between motor skill learning, EF, and brain plasticity. Importantly, our study provides preliminary evidence supporting the use of motor skill learning, such as football juggling, as a potential avenue for cognitive enhancement."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Each group was subjected to a series of five massages. The treatment was performed for the sternocleidomastoid, levator scapulae, and the descending part of the trapezius muscle. The parameters of muscle frequency and stiffness were measured using a Myoton Pro Digital device. The compression sensitivity was measured using a Force algometer. The results obtained showed significant differences in the stiffness parameters of the muscles studied between the groups, which indicates a positive effect of massage on muscle function in patients with COPD. The greatest significant differences were found in the patient’s sensitivity parameters. The application of the massage series significantly improved the parameters of frequency and decreased stiffness of inspiratory accessory muscles in patients with COPD compared to the group of healthy participants. This massage is an effective method to normalize muscle tone and thus improve the functional status of patients with COPD."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Research on the efficiency of\npropulsion, similarly generated by a relatively larger the monofin surface, showed that quality of the upward movement phase is a measure of swimming\nperformance. Therefore, the forces generated as a result of upward and downward kicks in butterfly swimming were analysed. The ability of the swimmers\nto kinaesthetically control of the upward dolphin kicking was also researched. Ten international level butterfly swimmers (mean 18,2±1,4 years) took part in\nthe research. They performed three trials on 25m distance, at maximum speed using the monofin device (The plate of standard monofin was removed and\ntwo strain gauges were affixed in the middle, between the toe). They randomly swam: 1) butterfly stroke (BS), 2) dolphin-kicking only (LK) and 3) swam\nbeing focused on activation of upward-kicking (AUK). Time dependent signals of the force sagging the fin in reaction to the water resistance were\nregistered. The impulses of force sagging the fin in each stroke were lower in upbeat than in downbeat. The lowest difference was in AUK trial. First, Wilks's\ntest and then Duncan’s post hoc tests for each of the trial showed (at p≤0,05) that: downward impulses for LK was significantly higher than for BS. Upward\nimpulses did not differ between the trials. Downward times for AUK, the same as total trial times, was significantly longer than for BS and for LK Upward\ntimes for AUK was significantly longer than for BS. The results demonstrated, that butterfly arms action leads to intensification of both kicking phases. The\nswimmers were well skilled for kinaesthetic controlling of the dolphin upbeat. They did not obtain the equal proportion between propulsion effect of both\nkicking phases, but it has been suggested, that this level of skill mastering is out of the human motor abilities. Opportunities for conscious controlling of the\nefficiency of the upward movement are seen in the modification of the time structure of this phase.

Thus, identifying effective methods to enhance visuomotor abilities is crucial. The main objective of this research was to investigate the impact of a six-week stroboscopic intervention on visuomotor reaction speed in goal-directed specific movements based on agility among young volleyball players. Additionally, the study aimed to explore the impact of saccade dynamics on visuomotor reaction speed performance throughout the experiment.\n\nMethods\nThere were 50 athletes (26 males and 24 females) with an average age of 16.5 years (± 0.6) who participated in this study. Over a six-week training period, athletes performed volleyball-specific training either wearing stroboscopic glasses (intervention) or under normal visual conditions (control). Prior to and after the training period, the agility tests based on change-of-direction speed (CODS) and reactive agility (RA) were used to identify visuomotor reaction speed performance. To measure agility performance a five-repetition shuttle run to gates was conducted. The REAC-INDEX, which represents visuomotor reaction speed, was analyzed as the resulting difference between the CODS test and the RA test. To elicit saccadic dynamics, a laboratory visual search task was performed.\n\nResults\nA significant GROUP×TIME interaction was observed for the REAC-INDEX (p = 0.012, ηp2 = 0.13). ANCOVA analyses revealed significant GROUP differences, indicating improved post-training REAC-INDEX results (p = 0.004, d = 0.87), regardless of gender. Training-induced modulations in saccade acceleration did not reach significance, but a significant relationship was observed between changes in saccade acceleration and changes in the REAC-INDEX (r = -0.281, p = 0.048), indicating that higher performance gains following training were associated with a stronger increase in saccade acceleration.\n\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrates that stroboscopic training effectively enhances visuomotor reaction speed in goal-directed movements based on agility. Furthermore, visuomotor reaction speed gains could potentially be mediated by saccade dynamics. These findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of stroboscopic eyewear for training sport-specific visuomotor skills among young volleyball players."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Methods: The study sample consisted of 89 young amateur athletes. Movement pattern quality was assessed by the Functional Movement Screen (FMS), test and body posture in the frontal plane was assessed by the moire method for the parameters Shoulder Slope Angle, Lower Scapula Protrusion Difference, and Pelvic Tilt Angle. Injury data were collected through completion of the Injury History Questionnaire for the past 12 months. Results: Using cluster analysis, participants were allocated into a either category with good (BPg) body posture or poor (BPp), and using FMS cutoff points (14), either a category of good movement pattern quality (MPg) or poor (MPp). Two-way ANOVA was performed, and the Bonferroni post-hoc test revealed a reduction in injuries among participants from the MPg-BPg group compared to the other three groups (p < 0.05). However, no interaction between factors was revealed. No statistically significant differences were observed among the remaining three groups in the case of injury prevalence (p > 0.05). Conclusions: A combination of proper body posture and high-quality movement patterns is associated with a lower frequency of injuries, without direct interaction between chosen factors, which suggests that they impact injury risk independently. Practicing suitable BP and ensuring high-quality MPs should be regarded as a strategy in injury prevention."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

A cascade of biomechanical changes occurs with postural deviations. Therefore, this study aimed to determine\nthe trunk position and spine shape during smartphone use.\nMethods. Body posture was tested by the photogrammetric method in habitual standing position and while using smartphones in 39 healthy subjects of both sexes.\nResults. While using smartphones, the trunk was shifted backwards (F(1.37) = 166.19, p = 0.0000), and the angle of the cervical\nspine increased in both sexes (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the depth of thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis increased (p < 0.001), though only in the female group, but there were no differences in cervical load between groups (p > 0.05).\nConclusions.

This research addresses the phenomenon by developing two distinct numerical models of the human head, simulating individuals people aged 77 and 28, respectively. These models are methodically constructed based on medical imaging data acquired through collaboration with hospitals and subsequently verified through empirical experimentation. Studies have shown that the main factor that influences the vulnerability to bridging vein rupture in older adults is the degenerative processes of nervous tissue. The most visible structural damage was observed in the outflow cuff segment. This phenomenon can be primarily attributed to specific geometric parameters associated with this anatomical region. The presented research emphasises the importance of computational models in understanding the pathomechanics of brain structures. As a result of the analyses, it was proven that the neurodegenerative processes of the brain that occur with age are crucial in understanding the higher incidence of subdural haematomas in elderly people."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

That survey also included questions about childbirth-related fears, sources of knowledge about childbirth and infant care, physical activity and participation in childbirth classes. The study consisted of 224 postpartum women, of whom 124 were examined during the COVID-19 pandemic (between March and June 2021). The data obtained were compared with the results of the examinations carried out prior to the pandemic (100 women were examined between February 2019 and May 2019).\nResults. In both of the analysed groups, the mean stress was at an average level. However, in the COVID-19 group, a significantly higher level of perceived stress was noted.

The study aimed to identify the relationship between regular physical training of pregnant women, carried out in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and postural stability during the perinatal period.\n\nMethods:\n58 women in the first trimester of pregnancy took part in the study and were divided into two groups according to their own choice. The exercise group participated in physical training three times a week during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The non-exercise group did not engage in additional physical activity. All subjects underwent three postural stability tests using a stabilograph.\n\nResults:\nIn assessing posture stability parameters, significant differences were found only in body coordination in the active group of women. The exercise group showed statistically significantly lower values of the stabilogram parameters (better postural stability) obtained postpartum compared to those taken during pregnancy. There were no significant differences between the results taken during pregnancy. In the group of non-exercising women, no significant differences were observed between the second measurement during pregnancy and the measurement made postpartum.\n\nConclusions:\nIt has been shown that physical activity has a significant impact on improving the coordination of women during pregnancy and postpartum. Women participating in regular physical training were characterised by smaller stabilogram deflections and better postural control compared to the control group."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance measurements were taken, tests of motor skills of the upper limbs and functional efficiency were performed, and the phenotype of physical weakness was assessed.\n\nResults:\nParticipants identified as pre-frailty were observed to score less favourably in motor skills tests compared to other participants. The significance of the differences between the males and females was confirmed for most tests of precision, coordination, and speed of the upper limbs, in addition to the number of aiming errors. A correlation was observed between reduced fine movements of the hand and age, reduced functional efficiency, and low muscle mass of the upper limbs. Of all the included hand motor tests, only hand tremor scores in the stability test did not affect the risk of pre-frailty.\n\nConclusions:\nThe study showed a significant, positive correlation between the fine movements of the hand, mainly with the weight and strength of the muscles of the upper limb, and negative in the case of the risk of frailty syndrome. It is advisable to focus on programs to raise awareness of the importance of physical activity, which translates into health and quality of life."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

to scrutinise the kinematic and spatio-temporal characteristics of free and Nordic walking (NW) in older adults, utilising both traditional and biosensor-integrated mechatronic poles. The hypothesis was that including biosensors for gait analysis in NW poles would not disrupt the walking pattern of older adults compared to standard poles. The study involved seniors aged 65–74 who were amateur Nordic Walking (NW) practitioners. They were instructed to traverse a 100-m distance three times: without poles, with traditional NW poles, and with mechatronic poles. The MyoMOTION MR3 system was used to gather biomechanical data. The study revealed differences in eight kinematic parameters and stride time between free walking and walking with poles. However, no statistically significant differences were observed in any of the parameters, regardless of the pole type used. The findings suggest that older NW practitioners tend to employ free walking patterns even when using poles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Intravenous iron in iron deficient patients with HF has attenuated HF symptoms, however the pathomechanisms remain unclear. The aim of study was to assess whether intravenous iron supplementation as compared to placebo improves energy metabolism of skeletal muscles in patients with HF.\r\n\r\nMethods: Men with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and ID were randomised in 1:1 ratio to either intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (IV FCM) or placebo. In vivo reduction of lactates by exercising skeletal muscles of forearm was analyzed. A change in lactate production between week 0 and 24 was considered as a primary endpoint of the  study.\r\n\r\nResults: There were two study arms: the placebo and the IV FCM (12 and 11 male patients with HFrEF). At baseline, there were no differences between these two study arms. IV FCM therapy as compared to placebo reduced the exertional production of lactates in exercising skeletal muscles. These effects were accompanied by a significant increase in both serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in the IV FCM arm which was not demonstrated in the placebo arm.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Intravenous iron supplementation in iron deficient men with HFrEF improves the functioning of skeletal muscles via an improvement in energy metabolism in exercising skeletal muscles, limiting the contribution of anaerobic reactions generating ATP as reflected by a lower in vivo lactate production in exercising muscles in patients with repleted iron stores."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The function of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential to the proper formation and function of the nervous system and is seen to be regulated by many microRNAs. However, understanding how microRNAs influence BDNF actions within cells requires a wider comprehension of their integrative regulatory mechanisms. Aim: In this literature review, we have synthesized the evidence of microRNA regulation on BDNF in cells and tissues, and provided an analytical discussion about direct and indirect mechanisms that appeared to be involved in BDNF regulation by microRNAs. Methods: Searches were conducted on PubMed.gov using the terms “BDNF” AND “MicroRNA” and “brain-derived neurotrophic factor” AND “MicroRNA”, updated on 1 September 2023. Papers without open access were requested from the authors. One hundred and seventy-one papers were included for review and discussion. Results and Discussion: The local regulation of BDNF by microRNAs involves a complex interaction between a series of microRNAs with target proteins that can either inhibit or enhance BDNF expression, at the core of cell metabolism. Therefore, understanding this homeostatic balance provides resources for the future development of vector-delivery-based therapies for the neuroprotective effects of BDNF."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Twelve male IHD patients (66.2 ± 5.2 years, 12.2 ± 7.5 years of disease duration) were evaluated pre- and post-training for (i) gait parameters, (ii) exercise tolerance using electrocardiographic (ECG) stress test, (iii) a 6-min walk test (6MWT). The NW training, adhering to IHD patient guidelines, involved a 100-m walk at a self-selected, preferred speed without sticks, with classic NW sticks and mechatronic sticks. A mechatronic measuring system, specifically engineered for measuring, diagnosing and monitoring the patient's gait, was integrated into mechatronic sticks. Post-training, significant enhancements were observed in ECG stress test duration, metabolic equivalency, and 6MWT distance, irrespective of the stick type. However, no significant changes were noted in spatiotemporal parameters concerning the measured side, stick utilisation, or type. The results suggest that NW training boosts exercise capacity and refines gait mechanics in male IHD patients. However, the improvement in exercise capacity was not linked to changes in gait mechanics from NW training but rather to the movement during NW gait. Hence, the key to enhancing exercise capacity in IHD patients is the movement during NW gait, not the quality of gait mechanics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein crucial for neuronal growth and survival, plays a vital role in brain function and plasticity. Notably, obese individuals tend to exhibit lower BDNF levels, potentially contributing to cognitive decline. Physical exercise offers health benefits, including improved circulating BDNF levels and cognitive function, but the specific impacts of acute versus regular exercise on circulating BDNF levels in obesity are unclear. Understanding this can guide interventions to enhance brain health and counter potential cognitive decline in obese individuals. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of acute and regular physical exercise on circulating BDNF in individuals with obesity. The target population comprised individuals classified as overweight or obese, encompassing both acute and chronic protocols involving all training methods. A comprehensive search was conducted across computerized databases, including PubMed, Academic Search Complete, and Web of Science, in August 2022, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Initially, 98 studies were identified, from which 16 studies, comprising 23 trials, met the selection criteria. Substantial heterogeneity was observed for both acute (I2 = 80.4%) and long-term effects (I2 = 88.7%), but low risk of bias for the included studies. A single session of exercise increased circulating BDNF levels among obese patients compared to the control group (ES = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.19 to 2.30, p = 0.021). However, with extended periods of physical exercise, there was no significant increase in circulating BDNF levels when compared to the control group (ES = 0.49, 95% CI = −0.08 to 1.06, p = 0.089). These findings highlight the need to consider exercise duration and type when studying neurobiological responses in obesity and exercise research. The study’s results have implications for exercise prescription in obesity management and highlight the need for tailored interventions to optimize neurotrophic responses. Future research should focus on elucidating the adaptive mechanisms and exploring novel strategies to enhance BDNF modulation through exercise in this population. However, further research is needed considering limitations such as the potential age-related confounding effects due to diverse participant ages, lack of sex-specific analyses, and insufficient exploration of how specific exercise parameters (e.g., duration, intensity, type) impact circulating BDNF."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

While prior investigators have mainly compared athletes and non-athletes on MOT, MIT more closely resembles dynamic real-life environments. Here we compared the performance and gaze behavior of handball players with non-athletes on both MOT and MIT. Since previous researchers have shown that MOT and MIT engage different eye movement strategies, we had participants track 3–5 targets among 10 moving objects. In MOT, the objects were identical, while in MIT they differed in shape and color. Although we observed no group differences for tracking accuracy, the eye movements of athletes were more target-oriented than those of non-athletes. We concluded that tasks and stimuli intended by researchers to demonstrate that athletes’ show better object tracking than non-athletes should be specific to the athletes’ type of sport and should use more perception-action coupled measures. An implication of this conclusion is that the differences in object tracking skills between athletes and non-athletes is highly specific to the skills demanded by the athletes’ sport."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

First, the important role of safety education and the need to seek new means of influencing young people is presented and the significant role of sport in this area. The field of Far Eastern combat sports was underlined here as being particularly important because they contain internal codes of moral conduct. Therefore, the new argument is to take the perspective of karate as a combat sport, martial art, and self defence system in one. Karate as a combat sport refers to fighting skills in the following directions: traditional, sport and Olympic; and in the following systems: semi contact, knockdown, full contact, mix fighting. Karate as a martial art has a health-promoting character and emphasises the psycho-physical development of practitioners and the recognition of ethical codes. And karate as a self defence system is concerned with proficiency in out-of-sport confrontations, but also in risk assessment. Karate has been found to be an effective means in educating young people to safety, but in order for it to be effective, it needs to be adopted in its entirety. Because the combat sport perspective activates youth in physical culture, the martial art perspective educates according to norms and rules; and the self defence system perspective teaches how to act in difficult situations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

An experimental clinical randomized study was conducted in six categories (three controls and three experimental groups) of adults who were divided into six groups: control hypertensive (CG-HTN, n=10), control elevated blood pressure (CG-ELE, n=10), control normotensive (CG-NT, n=10), experimental hypertensive (ExG-HTN, n=10), elevated blood pressure (ExG-ELE, n=10), or normotensive (ExG-NT, n=10). The participants underwent 6 weeks of concurrent training with 5 min of high-intensity interval plus 5 min of resistance training (CTHIIT+RT), where systolic pulse wave velocity of the brachial artery (PWVba) (primary outcome) and additional secondary blood pressure, body composition, and vascular outcomes were measured before and after 6 weeks of intervention. After 6 weeks of CTHIIT+RT, significant reductions in ΔPWVba were reported in ExG-HTN vs. ExG-NT (diff. 0.86 m/s-1) and between ExG-ELE and ExG-NT (diff. 0.76 m/s-1). In conclusion, 6 weeks of CTHIIT+RT reduced arterial stiffness in adults with different blood pressure controls, but with a superior magnitude in HTN patients.

The study determined the Age of Peak Height Velocity (APHV) and evaluated sensorimotor ability through pre-planned COD and not-planned AG five-time shuttle runs, measuring the time difference as the index of reactivity. Positive correlations were found between COD and AG with fat mass index (FMI) in boys, while negative relative lower limb length (rLL) correlated with COD. In females, age of peak height velocity (APHV) showed a significant negative relationship with sensorimotor ability. Linear and polynomial regressions confirmed predictive and curvilinear relationships, respectively. Cluster analysis identified different associations in boys and girls, emphasizing sex-specific patterns. Body fat percentage had a negative impact on COD-AG in boys, while the optimal lower limb length proportion positively influenced COD due to enhanced maneuverability. Maturation affected sensorimotor abilities in girls.

This study investigated the age-related effects of high-intensity functional training (HIFT), based on bodyweight resistance exercises conducted during physical education lessons, on muscle mass and strength improvement. (2) Methods: Adolescent males (n = 116) were allocated to four HIFT experimental groups (EGs) and four standard physical education program control groups (CGs) according to age (15, 16, 17, and 18 years [y]). The changes in muscle mass (absolute and relative to height [SMI]), hand–grip strength (HGS), sit-ups (SUs), and standing broad jump (SBJ) were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni tests. (3) Results: HIFT significantly increased muscle mass and scores in all strength tests (p < 0.01), while chronological age was significant for HGS (p < 0.01). Interactions between HIFT and chronological age categories were observed for HGS (p = 0.01) and SBJ (p < 0.03). Detailed post hoc tests revealed improvement in muscle mass across all chronological age categories for both approaches (p < 0.05). The 18y-EG group improved HGS over their control peers (p < 0.01), the EG groups significantly improved their SU results (p < 0.01), and SBJ improved in the 15y-EG and 18y-EG groups compared to their control (p < 0.01). (4) Conclusions: This research highlights the effectiveness of a school-based HIFT program in promoting muscle mass gains and enhancing muscle strength among adolescents. The findings offer valuable insights for implementing bodyweight exercises during physical education classes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This is due to the specific structure of tasks performed in these sports as they require a comprehensive and integrated function of broadly understood physical fitness. The present study aimed to develop and check the Special Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Fitness Test: Takedown Zone (SBJJFT-TZ), Gi formula’s reliability. The major task of this sport-specific tool is to illustrate the comprehensive special fitness and performance of professional Brazilian jiu-jitsu athletes. Methods: The study covered 27 BJJ athletes (age in years: 25.36 ± 2.99; height: 175.04 ± 5.70 cm; weight: 76.56 ± 8.59 kg; BMI: 24.96 ± 2.30; 6.33 ± 2.51 years of training) with a high sports skill level. A coaches’ ranking of the athletes studied according to sports achievement was developed. An experimental approach to the problem was employed, with the SBJJFT-TZ assessment, including throws and specialized locomotion, performed on two dates (seven days apart). The test parameters were recorded and, using a specialized formula, an index showing comprehensive special fitness was calculated. To verify the test’s validity and reliability, using statistical procedures, the results were comparatively analyzed (Student’s t-test for the dependent variables), and the relationships between rankings were examined (Pearson’s r linear correlation). The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: The analyses showed statistically significant relationships with very high strength between coach ranking and SBJJFT-TZ parameters for both dates (R = 0.73–0.88; p < 0.001). A similar trend of significant correlations was noted between the first and second SBJJFT-TZ dates (R = 0.96–0.98; p < 0.001), and the strength of the coexistence was almost complete. The test-retest procedure for SBJJFT-TZ showed similar levels for the parameters studied, without significant variation (p > 0.05) but with a weak effect profile (d = 0.03–0.06). Internal variation in the variables was very low (HR CV < 10%) and moderate (Throws and Index CV = 20.82–32.25%). Significantly different throwing performance between sets was shown, with an advantage in the first round of work compared to the second, and a moderate effect (p < 0.05; d = 0.38–0.39). Conclusions: The identification of relationships, the comparison, and the test-retest procedure showed the high application value of SBJJFT-TZ. The proposed tool provides a reliable cross-sectional evaluation of BJJ athletes’ special fitness and performance in the stand-up fighting plane, as well as at the moment of achieving an advantage over the opponent, and favors implementation in field conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

RSBFP age of 16.15 ± 0.36 years, body height 170.82 ± 8.16 cm, weight 61.23 ± 12.80 kg, and BMI 20.86 ± 3.29 kg/m2.

The sample consisted of 278 matches with 570 goals scored during official matches of the 2022/23 Polish Ekstraklasa season. All data was collected utilising the computerised multiple-camera optical tracking system TRACAB. Total distance covered (TD), standing distance (StD; < 0.72 km h−1), walking distance (WD; 0.73–7.2 km h−1), jogging distance (JG; 7.21–14.4 km h−1), running distance (RD; 14.41–19.8 km h−1), high-speed running distance (HSR; 19.81–25.2 km h−1) and sprinting distance (SprD; > 25.2 km h−1) were analysed in 5-min intervals prior to a goal scored for both teams. The employed linear mixed models showed that all examined match-running performance metrics were higher in teams that scored a goal compared to teams that conceded a goal. Within 5 min before scoring a goal in Polish Ekstraklasa matches, the scoring team produced significantly greater TD (∆ 95%CI 256.8–300.4 m; p = 0.001), WD (∆ 95%CI 52.3–95.8 m; p = 0.001), JG (∆ 95%CI 100.5–144.1 m; p = 0.001) and RD (∆ 95%CI 16.2–59.8 m; p = 0.001) compared to the conceding team, although no differences were found for HSR and SprD. These results demonstrate the enhanced identification potential of key physical performance factors influencing goal scoring in the Polish Ekstraklasa, thereby optimising the training process and improving overall performance. To enhance the effectiveness of soccer training, coaching and performance staff should consider this study's findings, that indicate an increase in the volume of medium- and low-intensity running efforts preceding a goal."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

New repolarization markers, such as the Tpeak-Tend interval and JTpeak intervals, have not yet been profoundly studied in obese patients. The study aims to analyze whether, in patients with obesity and overweight, repolarization markers, including the Tpeak-Tend interval, are prolonged and simultaneously check the frequency of other ECG pathologies in a 12-lead ECG in this group of patients. Methods: A study group consisted of 181 adults (90 females and 91 males) with overweight and first-class obesity. The participants completed a questionnaire, and the ECG was performed and analyzed. Results: When analyzing the classic markers, only QT dispersion was significantly higher in obese people. The Tpeak-Tend parameter (97.08 ms ± 23.38 vs. 89.74 ms ± 12.88, respectively), its dispersion, and JTpeak-JTend parameters were statistically significantly longer in the obese group than in the controls. There were also substantial differences in P-wave, QRS duration, and P-wave dispersion, which were the highest in obese people. Tpeak-Tend was positively correlated with body mass and waist circumference, while JTpeak was with BMI, hip circumference, and WHR. Tpeak/JT was positively correlated with WHR and BMI. In backward stepwise multiple regression analysis for JTpeak-WHR, type 2 diabetes and smoking had the highest statistical significance. Conclusions: Only selected repolarization markers are significantly prolonged in patients with class 1 obesity and, additionally, in this group, we identified more pathologies of P wave as well as prolonged QRS duration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

A total of 83 patients with HTA were qualified for the study (age: 71.3 ± 8.5 years). All subjects underwent carotid arteries ultrasound and coronary arteries CT. The carotid plaque score was assessed using ultrasound. The studied group was divided into two subgroups: a subgroup with the carotid plaque score ≤ 1 (A) and a subgroup with carotid plaque score ≥ 2 (B). Coronary arteries CT assessed coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and degree of coronary stenosis based on CAD-RADS. In subgroup B, a significantly higher CACS (411.3 ± 70.1 vs. 93.5 ± 31.8) and significantly higher grade in the CAD-RADS classification were demonstrated than in subgroup A (CAD-RADS ≥ 3: 21.8 vs. 6.0%). The regression analysis showed that carotid plaque score and age are independent risk factors for the severity of atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries. In summary, ultrasound assessment of the carotid plaque score in patients with HTA could be considered as surrogate indicator of the risk and severity of atherosclerotic changes in the coronary arteries, but further studies are necessary to corroborate these results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Materials: Thirty adolescent swimmers with supraspinatus (SS) tendinopathy (n = 15) and a control matched group (n = 15) were evaluated. Tendon thickness was measured according to four different measure procedures, i.e., (1) at 15 mm, (2) at 10, 20, and 30 mm, (3) at 10, 15, and 20 mm, and (4) 5 and 10 mm lateral to the most hyperechogenic reference point of the biceps tendon. Each examiner took two US images for the test measurements with a 10 min rest period. After 30 min, the subjects underwent retest measurements that were also repeated 1 week later. Results: SST thickness was greater in swimmers with SS tendinopathy compared with the matched control group for each procedure and rater (p < 0.001). Intra- and inter-rater reliability was good to excellent (ICC2.3: 0.78–0.98 and 0.83–0.97, respectively) in both groups. The lowest intra- and inter-rater reliability was found in procedures no. 2 and 4 (ICC2.3: 0.78 and 0.83). However, procedure no. 3 was the most reliable with the lowest error rate (ICC2.3: 0.92–0.97; SEM: 0.05–0.10 mm; MDC: 0.14–0.28 mm). Conclusions: The study confirmed the diagnostic value of ultrasound in SS tendinopathy.

The likely reason for this situation may be the inadequate communication of physical culture to today's generations: BB (baby boomers), X (great unknowns), Y (millennials), Z (snowflakes), Alpha (digital). Therefore, the aim of this article is to address the problem of declining interest in physical activity in Poland by identifying the appropriate approach of teachers, trainers and instructors to today's generations. The specifics of BB, X, Y, Z and Alpha generations are described and their expectations regarding physical activity are indicated. It was concluded that activating these social groups should be done by prompting topics that are important to them. Thus, BB value organizational stability, X need to see the purposefulness and attractiveness of the activities, Y equate physical activity with personal development, Z only take up useful forms of activities, and finally Alpha like smart technology-assisted activities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The insights presented in this chapter offer valuable guidance for coaches and analysts, aiding them in selecting pertinent parameters to effectively monitor training loads in soccer.\nIt is imperative to recognize that, irrespective of the chosen parameters in our professional endeavors, the fundamental importance lies in the careful standardization of measurement tools. Only through this standardization and the ability to derive practical conclusions can we ensure a reliable assessment of our activities.

Determining the degree of asymmetry in table tennis players can indicate the need to appropriately manage the training process, including compensatory or corrective exercises in the training program, especially since recent studies confirm that training interventions can reduce sporting asymmetries and improve performance. This study aimed to assess the amount of asymmetry in the trunk regarding the frontal plane and the difference between limb circumferences in female table tennis players compared to the control group (non-athletes).\nMethods. Twenty-two women took part in the study. Ten of them were table tennis professionals with an average training experience of 7 \u0006 4.3 years (the exclusion criterion of the study was a minimum of 3 years of training experience). As a comparison group, the study included 12 female students who did not participate in competitive sports. Body posture was assessed in all subjects using equipment for computer analysis of asymmetry in the torso using the photogrammetric method. Additionally, all the subjects had their upper and lower limb circumferences measured.\nResults. The results of the conducted research showed asymmetry in the frontal plane in the table tennis player group. As many as six parameters\u0016regarding the pelvic rotation angle, angle of trunk inclination, the height of the angles of the lower shoulder blades and their distance from the spine, as well as the waist triangles, difference in the width and height of the waist triangles and the angle of trunk inclination\u0016indicated asymmetry in this group but significantly differed from the control group (p\u00140:05) only in the first parameter given above. The calculated differences in circumference between the right and left sides in the individual groups were statistically different in several cases (p\u00140:05). This concerned the circumferences of the arms, forearms, elbows, and knees of table tennis players.\nConclusions. The research carried out in this study allowed us to determine the occurrence of asymmetry in the frontal plane of the trunk and between the limbs of table tennis players. According to some studies, this may be a risk factor for injury. However, despite the lack of uniform views in the literature on the importance and threats resulting from asymmetries, it appears that, if only for aesthetic reasons, table tennis would require compensatory or corrective training aimed at developing symmetry of the body structure."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This study aimed to assess the reliability of the Q-LAC analyzer in determining SmO2 levels during incremental cycling exercise. Thirteen physically active males (age 28.1 ± 5.3 y; height 181.2 ± 5.7 cm; body mass 79.9 ± 11.1 kg; BMI 24.2 ± 2.4 kg/m2) participated in this study. A submaximal incremental exercise test (SIET) on an electromagnetic cycle ergometer with a seven-day interval was performed twice. SmO2 levels in the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle of the dominant leg were simultaneously recorded using the Q-LAC device during both tests. The study calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the coefficient of variation (CV), the standard error of measurement (SEM), the smallest worthwhile change (SWC), and mean detectable change (MDC). A within-within-subjects ANOVA revealed no statistically significant effects for session (F1,12 = 0.97, p = 0.34, η2 = 0.07) and the interaction between session and workload (F4,48 = 0.19, p = 0.94, η2 = 0.02). ICC values ranged from 0.72 to 0.91. Furthermore, the analysis of CV, SEM, and SWC indicated that SmO2 measurements obtained with the Q-LAC device exhibit good reliability but marginal sensitivity. In conclusion, the portable Q-LAC analyzer provides consistent measurements of muscle oxygen saturation during low-to-moderate-intensity exercise on a cycle ergometer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This study aimed to assess the impact of four distinct training programs on maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and cardiovascular health markers. The programs included: 1) a polarised training program (POL) incorporating sprint interval training (SIT), high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with long intervals, and low-intensity training (LIT); 2) a program focused solely on SIT training; 3) a program focused solely on long interval HIIT training; and 4) a program focused solely on LIT. The outcomes of interest were VO2max, lectin-like oxidised low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) expression, and serum concentration of oxidised low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL).\nMethods. This study enrolled 40 physically active individuals, categorised into four groups. Group POL (n = 10) engaged in a comprehensive POL training program, while group SIT (n = 10), group HIIT (n = 10), and group LIT (n = 10) participated in dedicated SIT, HIIT, and LIT training programs, respectively. SIT included 30-second all-out repetitions, HIIT included 3-minute high-intensity repetitions, LIT performed with intensity at the first ventilatory threshold. Throughout five weeks, participants in all groups underwent three weekly training sessions. Preceding and following the experiment, participants underwent an incremental test and a VO2max verification test. Additionally, serum concentrations of lectin-like oxidised lowdensity ipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) and oxidised low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) were measured before the incremental test.\nResults. Following the conclusion of the experiment, notable mixed effects were observed. Specifically, statistically significant increases were identified in VO2max, with a 14.2% enhancement in the POL group and a 9.5% improvement in the HIIT group. Moreover, there were substantial reductions in LOX-1 levels, demonstrating a 51.5% decrease in the POL group and a 61.1% decrease in the HIIT group.\nConclusions. The findings led to the conclusion that both the POL and long interval HIIT programs were effective in enhancing VO2max and lowering serum levels of LOX-1 among physically active individuals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Twelve elite healthy male 400-m sprinters with a minimum of six years of regular sprint training experience were recruited. They were divided into two groups for the experiment: a 350-m and a 500-m trial group. Time and kinematics of sprinting step motion for specific segments, i.e., starting to final stages of each trial, were obtained using the Opto Jump-Microgate optical measurement system. The starting phase of each sprint was defined as the section without muscular fatigue (noF), and the final phase was the sprint under muscular fatigue (onF). Each last 25 m of the 50-m evaluated section containing ten complete running steps was selected for detailed statistical analysis. Various patterns of temporal and spatial variables of sprinting efforts were observed between 350-m and 500-m trials. Each trial result was influenced by significant individual changes (p < 0.05). All variables indicated that the two distances differed significantly in terms of running kinematics. This was confirmed by significant differences in the mean step frequency (p < 0.001), which presented a difference of 11.75%, and the mean step speed (p < 0.001). As a result of these changes, a hierarchical intermittent endurance training pattern was defined. The research concluded that special endurance (intermittent sprints) based on 350 m differed significantly in kinematics from sprints over 500 m. Therefore, it should be assumed that the distance of 350 m is more similar in its kinematics to the 400-m competition. This should encourage coaches and athletes to apply a 350-m distance in training developing special endurance, especially in the pre-competitive and competitive periods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

However, strongly advocated by scientists and practitioners, the CI effect also aroused some doubts. Therefore, our objective was to review the existing literature on CI and to determine how it affects retention in motor learning. We found 1255 articles in the following databases: Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, supplemented by the Google Scholar search engine. We screened full texts of 294 studies, of which 54 were included in the meta-analysis. In the meta-analyses, two different models were applied, i.e., a three-level mixed model and random-effects model with averaged effect sizes from single studies. According to both analyses, high CI has a medium beneficial effect on the whole population. These effects were statistically significant. We found that the random practice schedule in laboratory settings effectively improved motor skills retention. On the contrary, in the applied setting, the beneficial effect of random practice on the retention was almost negligible. The random schedule was more beneficial for retention in older adults (large effect size) and in adults (medium effect size). In young participants, the pooled effect size was negligible and statically insignificant."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The IG participated in a 5-min massage session of the lateral and medial gastrocnemius muscle (LGCM and MGCM respectively). The muscle contractile properties were assessed by tensiomyography (TMG). It measured maximal displacement (Dm), delay time (Td) and contraction time (Tc). Oscillation frequency (F) and stiffness (S) were used to assess muscle passive mechanical properties. These measurements were collected by MytonPro.\nResults: There were no differences between the groups in the pre-test measurements. The results of mixed-model ANOVA showed significant (p < 0.05) time × group interactions, with greater alteration in the IG compared to the CG in the LGCM for Dm (%diff = 22.5, ƞp2 = 0.41), Td (%diff = 3.63, ƞp2 = 0.02), Tc (%diff = 13.38, ƞp2 = 0.1), F (%diff = 5.55, ƞp2 = 0.07) and in the MGCM for Dm (%diff = 􀀀 14.34, ƞp2 = 0.06), F (%diff = 􀀀 7.53, ƞp2 = 0.12).

Non-probability, cross-sectional sampling was used to select participants from a university student population. Young adults (19–21 years of age, n = 144) and their parents were examined. The data of those family pairs with complete sets of results were used. Dietary patterns and physical activity were assessed with questionnaires (QEB and IPAQ), and body height, weight measurements, and body mass indexes were calculated. A cophylogenetic approach with tanglegrams and heatmaps was used to study patterns, while predictors of body mass index were identified using multiple linear regression, stepwise logistic regression, and mediation analysis procedures. Cophenetic statistics confirmed significant incongruence between fathers and sons, confirmed by Baker’s Gamma correlation (rBG = 0.23, p = 0.021), and mothers and daughters (rBG = 0.26, p = 0.030). The relationships between the dietary patterns of the fathers and daughters, as well as mothers and sons, were of medium strength (rBG = 0.33, p = 0.032, rBG = 0.43, p = 0.031; respectively). Most of the patterns were mixed. Fast food, fried meals, alcoholic drinks, energy drinks, and sweetened beverages were associated significantly with being overweight. Significant intrinsic predictors of excessive weight in young adults were sex (b = 2.31, p < 0.001), PA (b = −0.02, p < 0.001), and eating fermented milk and curd cheese (b = −0.55, p = 0.024), while extrinsic (parental) predictors included eating fast food and fried meals (b = −0.44, p = 0.049). Both physical activity and dietary behaviors independently determined the sons’ overweight status (b = −1.25, p = 0.008; b = −0.04, p < 0.001; respectively); while only PA did in daughters (b = −0.04, p < 0.001). No mediating effects of physical activity were observed. Adult children and parental dietary patterns were divergent, reflecting the influence of multiple factors on a child’s dietary habits. However, this divergence is moderated by sex.

Methods: The sample included 14 elite male volleyball players of the University of Nitra club (22.3 ± 5.7 years). Measurements consisted of body height (BH); body weight (BM); body mass index (BMI), and the defensive agility test (DRAT (test-retest)) with an interval of one week between the two tests using an electronic timer (Witty photocell) and Witty SEM lights (Microgate, ITA). The validation included assessing the equality of mean values in the test and retest (t-Student), effect sizes with Cohen’s d, analysis of variance (ANOVA), intraclass correlation coefficient determinations (ICC model), and random intercept correlation (Φ). Results: The results indicated no significant differences in both tests except for left movement (p = 0.0255). The ICC value of the test time was statistically significant (0.91); standard error of measurement (SEM = 0.02); repeatability coefficient (RC = 0.20); minimal difference (MD = 0.04). Effect sizes were trivial to small (d = ˂−0.05–0.17>; right), medium (d = 0.35; backward) a large (d = −0.67; left). Conclusions: The DRAT test showed excellent reliability in total time (ICC = 0.91). Validation of the DRAT test’s consistency, reliability, accuracy and validity can help coaches make decisions about evaluating and monitoring defensive reactive agility performance in sports games."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

(2) Methods: Ten males aged 20–23 years with relative strength in back squat 156 ± 14% body weight participated. The conditioning activity, based on three series of five repetitions of assisted jumps with a band (30% of body mass load reduction) with one minute rest between series, was introduced. (3) Results: The two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant interaction between effects (F = 7.78; p-eta = 0.30; p < 0.01). Comparison with the Bonferroni test showed that JH was higher than the baseline in the 3rd minute (p = 0.02; ES = 0.30) in the 6th (p < 0.01; ES = 0.39), and in the (9th p < 0.01; ES = 0.32) in an experimental condition. No factor statistically significantly distinguishes RS and NRS, but due to effect size (ES) relative strength (ES = −0.80), baseline jump ability (countermovement jump ES = −0.74; squat jump =−0.59), limb symmetry index (ES = −0.56) can be considered to contribute the most to positive effects. (4) Conclusions: The provided PAPE protocol is effective in enhancing JH but optimal rest should be established individually. Individuals characterized by greater muscular strength may benefit the most, but further consideration is needed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

It is a concise and clear approach to the topic, which aimed to conceptualise the inclusion of karate in areas of physical culture as a contemporarily attractive physical activity. Karate was described here as a combat sport, martial art, and self-defence system in the following areas of physical culture: physical education, physiotherapy, recreation, sports, and tourism. Reference here was made to physical activity focused on bunkai (circuit interpretation exercises), kata (circuit exercises), kihon (technical exercises), and kumite (combat exercises). It has been determined that practitioners’ involvement in karate culture affects their level of sense of coherence. In addition, the conditioning for using karate in physical culture to the maintenance of health was mentioned. Here, reference was made to the perceptual perspective of the bodily and mental practice of karate for health. It has been established that this can be effective by adopting only the objectives of karate as martial art. Based on the above, it was concluded that practising karate is present in all areas of physical culture as combat sport, martial art, and self-defence system, but practising karate only as martial art provides opportunities for maintenance of health."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The study used the modified Wu Huanqin game analysis method. It consists of complex observing\nthe game, counting the winning actions of a given player, sorting and identifying them, depending on the accuracy of the\nobservation. Three levels are included, with increasing detail in assessing players' actions. For all variables, percentage win\nrates were calculated. Comparative analyses were performed. Due to the specificity of the database, chi square tests and\nfraction tests were used.\nResults: The most important differences between analyzed players were identified, which are the basis for classifying them\ninto different playing styles. These differences, as shown in the work, relate to tactical actions in different phases of the\ngame: service actions, returns or in the so-called stalemate phase. They are related to the use of different strokes and their\ncombinations to score points by players of different styles of play.\nConclusions: The research carried out made it possible to identify the most important strokes and their combinations with\nwhich table tennis players score points and to identify differences between the playing styles. The results obtained in the\nwork can be valuable information for coaches and players, regarding the possibility of applying effective tactical actions\nin the game, the direction of development of a particular style, or even, as a consequence, the possibility of taking specific\nactions in the game against specific styles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Recent research suggests that the motor cortex may play a pivotal role in mediating the relationship between striatal dopamine depletion and motor function in PD. Understanding this connection is crucial for comprehending the origins of manual dexterity impairments in PD. Therefore, our study aimed to explore how motor cortex activation mediates the association between striatal dopamine depletion and manual dexterity in PD.\r\n\r\nMaterials and methods\r\nWe enrolled 26 mildly affected PD patients in their off-medication phase to undergo [18F]FDOPA PET/CT scans for evaluating striatal dopaminergic function. EEG recordings were conducted during bimanual anti-phase finger tapping tasks to evaluate motor cortex activity, specifically focusing on Event-Related Desynchronization in the beta band. Manual dexterity was assessed using the Purdue Pegboard Test. Regression-based mediation analysis was conducted to examine whether motor cortex activation mediates the association between striatal dopamine depletion and manual dexterity in PD.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nMediation analysis revealed a significant direct effect of putamen dopamine depletion on manual dexterity for the affected hand and assembly tasks (performed with two hands), with motor cortex activity mediating this association. In contrast, while caudate nucleus dopamine depletion showed a significant direct effect on manual dexterity, motor cortex mediation on this association was not observed.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nOur study confirms the association between striatum dopamine depletion and impaired manual dexterity in PD, with motor cortex activity mediating this relationship."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

In the absence of such a strategy, decision-making relies heavily on subjective opinions rooted in experience, lacking the essential foundation of objective information. The synergy between objective data and subjective experiences is key to a successful coaching process. Presently, a variety of tools exists to support the assessment of training load. Practitioners and sports scientists should consistently assess multiple data streams in pursuit of overarching conditioning goals in professional soccer, including the preservation and enhancement of various fitness attributes, optimization of readiness for competition, and mitigation of injury risk.\nA precise understanding of training load for individual players offers several benefits. It safeguards performance by preventing exposure to inadequate or excessive loads, facilitating the evaluation of training demands against known match requirements. This understanding also allows for the assessment of specific sessions or drills to ensure that targeted loads are achieved. Additionally, it enables ongoing monitoring during rehabilitation, ensuring a judicious return to training. In essence, the accurate comprehension of training load is integral to preserving player performance, preventing injuries, and maintaining optimal conditioning in the dynamic context of professional soccer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of a 6-week stroboscopic intervention on volleyball-specific blocking reaction speed. Additionally, it analyzes the variation in explosive leg strength as a potential factor influencing the effectiveness of volleyball blocking. Material and Methods: This study included 50 young volleyball players (26 males, 24 females), divided into an experimental and a control group. Both groups performed the same volleyball-specific tasks, but the experimental group did so under stroboscopic conditions. Participants were evaluated three times using a volleyball-specific blocking reaction task: pre-training, post-6-week training, and four weeks later. Additionally, a countermovement jump with arm swing (CMJA) test assessed its impact on blocking reaction speed. Results: The ANOVA conducted on the blocking reaction speed test revealed a significant effect of time (p<0.001, ηp2 = 0.17). In the stroboscopic group, significant differences were found between pre-test and post-test (p=0.031, d=0.54) and between post-test and retention test (p=0.017, d=0.58). The ANCOVA analysis revealed that variations in CMJA did not significantly affect the improvements in blocking reaction speed (p=0.426, ηp2 =0.01). Conclusion: Over six weeks, stroboscopic training was more effective than regular training in improving volleyball-specific blocking reaction speed, though these effects were short-term and ultimately showed no lasting differences between the groups. Furthermore, the enhancements in reaction speed were more likely due to adaptations in perceptual-cognitive performance rather than motor factors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Objective To identify measurement tools used to evaluate effects of airway clearance techniques in ventilated infants and children and to determine the clinimetric properties of these tools. Data Sources Pubmed, CINAHL, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Web of Science, up to November 2020. Study Selection Randomized and non-randomized clinical trials measuring any aspect of lung function during and/or after airway clearance techniques in mechanically ventilated infants and children from birth to sixteen years. Data extraction and data synthesis Two independent reviewers identified tools measuring effects of airway clearance techniques including secretion clearance, respiratory mechanics, gas exchange and changes on lung imaging. Extracted data included details of the tool, airway clearance intervention being evaluated and aspects of lung function being measured. Assessment of quality and clinimetric properties, including validity, reliability and responsiveness, were evaluated for each tool using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments methodology. Results Nine measurement tools measured the effects of airway clearance techniques on secretion clearance, respiratory mechanics, gas exchange and lung imaging. Five tools reported clinimetric properties although the yield and overall quality of studies was low. Tools measured many different aspects of lung function. The CO2SMO Plus respiratory mechanics monitor reported the most clinimetric data. Limitations Unpublished or in-progress studies were not included to ensure all data collected were peer-reviewed, therefore additional or novel tools may not have been identified. Included age ranges and definition of airway clearance techiques were kept broad to optimise study identification which may limit generalisability of results. Conclusion Measurement tools used by physiotherapists to enhance airway clearance in ventilated infants and children lack high quality evidence of validity, reliability and responsiveness. Measurements gained through these tools should therefore be interpreted with careful consideration until further climimetric evidence is available."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Yet, research on improving diagnostic accuracy in detecting accidents is insufficient. Combining multiple predictors and assessing them via ROC curves can enhance this accuracy. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the importance of lower limb muscle mass asymmetry and body composition (BMI and FMI) as predictors of injuries, (2) explore the role of the most effective body composition index in the relationship between muscle asymmetry and injury, and (3) assess the prognostic potential of combined predictors. Cross-sectional sampling was used to select students from a university. The sample included 237 physically active young adults (44% males). The independent variables were inter-limb muscle mass asymmetry (absolute asymmetry, AA), BMI, and FMI; the dependent variable was the number of injuries in the past year. Using zero-inflated Poisson regression, we examined the relationships, including a moderation analysis (moderated multiple ZIP regression). The mediation by body composition was tested using ZIP and logistic regression. The predictive power was assessed via ROC curves. The significance level was set at an α-value of 0.05. No significant difference in injury incidence between males and females was found (χ2 = 2.12, p = 0.145), though the injury types varied. Males had more muscle strains, while females had more bone fractures (χ2 = 6.02, p = 0.014). In males, the inter-limb asymmetry and FMI predicted injuries; in females, the BMI and FMI did, but not asymmetry. No moderating or mediating effects of body composition were found. In males, combined asymmetry and the FMI better predicted injuries (AUC = 0.686) than separate predictors (AA: AUC = 0.650, FMI: AUC = 0.458). For females, the FMI was the best predictor (AUC = 0.662). The most predictive factors for injuries in males were both muscle asymmetry and the FMI (as combined predictors), while in females, it was the single FMI. The hypothesis regarding the mediating role of body composition indicators was rejected, as no moderation or mediation by the FMI was detected in the relationship between absolute asymmetry (AA) and injuries. For clinical practice, the findings suggest that practitioners should incorporate assessments of both muscle asymmetry and body composition into routine screenings for physically active individuals. Identifying those with both high asymmetry and an elevated FMI can help target preventative interventions more effectively. Tailored strength training and conditioning programs aimed at reducing asymmetry and managing body composition may reduce the risk of injury, particularly in populations identified as high-risk."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Methods: The article adhered to the PRISMA 2020 statement for recommended reporting elements in systematic reviews. The inclusion criteria followed the PICO methodology. The literature search was conducted using databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Semantic Scholar, Europe PubMed Central, and Google Scholar. Studies on acupuncture and dry needling for scar treatment were included. Because of the diversity of the studies’ results and methodologies, a systematic review was conducted to organize and describe the findings without attempting a numerical synthesis. Results: Nineteen studies relevant to the article’s theme were identified, with eleven selected for detailed review. The studies included two case reports on dry needling, one case series on dry needling, five case reports on acupuncture, two randomized controlled trials on acupuncture, and one case report on Fu’s subcutaneous needling. A quality assessment was conducted using the JBI CAT and PEDro scales. Four case reports scored 7 points, one case scored 8 points, three cases were rated 6 points or lower, the case series was rated 6 points, and the randomized controlled trials scored 8 and 5 points. Most studies demonstrated a desired therapeutic effect in scar treatment with acupuncture and dry needling, but the level of evidence varied across studies. The analysis does not conclusively support the use of acupuncture and dry needling to improve scar conditions. Conclusions: Although dry-needling and acupuncture techniques are popular in physiotherapy, adequate scientific evidence is currently not available to support their effectiveness in scar treatment. There are gaps in the research methodology, a lack of randomized trials, and significant heterogeneity in the assessment of effects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Significant differences were found in comparisons between groups of athletes: football players and karate competitors (in severity of neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness), football players and basketball players  (in  severity  of  neuroticism,  extraversion,  openness  to  experience,  conscientiousness),  football  players  and  lugers  (in  severity  of  agreeableness),  football players and mountain bikers (in severity of neuroticism). One significant difference was noted in the comparisons between athletes from different levels: competitive athletes had higher neuroticism severity than elite athletes. A weak and negative correlation between neuroticism and sporting levels was verified. But  no  correlation  was  shown  between  personality  traits  and  the  likelihood  of  becoming  a  professional.  It  was  concluded  that  the  observed  differences  between the studied groups of athletes could be derived from the specifics of the different sports. The elite are characterised by a lower intensity of neuroticism in relation to the competitive athletes, which can be seen in the relationship: the lower the neuroticism, the higher the sporting level."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The interplay between cervical and thoracic spine mobility is hypothesized to contribute significantly to NP severity, yet this relationship requires further exploration. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 179 young white-collar workers with NP lasting for at least six weeks. Participants were stratified into mild (n = 78) and moderate (n = 101) pain groups based on their scores on the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ). Cervical and thoracic range of motion (ROM) in the sagittal plane was measured using inclinometers. NP severity was further assessed using the NPQ and the Neck Disability Index (NDI). Correlation, regression, and mediation analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between cervical and thoracic ROM and NP severity. Results: Thoracic ROM was higher in the mild pain group (median: 47.35, IQR: 10.13) than in the moderate pain group (median: 42.10, IQR: 13.60; p < 0.001). The NDI had a negative correlation with thoracic ROM (r = −0.65; p < 0.05) and a positive correlation with cervical ROM (r = 0.84; p < 0.01). Additionally, thoracic ROM mediated the effect of cervical ROM on NP, particularly influencing NDI scores (p < 0.01). Conclusions: This study found a significant association between reduced thoracic ROM and increased NP severity, highlighting the role of thoracic spine mobility in NP among young white-collar workers. Targeted interventions for thoracic dysfunction may reduce compensatory cervical strain and improve NP management, suggesting that thoracic spine assessments should be integrated into routine clinical evaluations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Methods: Fifty regional-level soccer players aged 13 to 15 took part in a randomized double-blind trial. They were allocated randomly to either receive diagonal manual mobilization (DM) treatment or undergo a Nordic hamstring curl (NHC) intervention, designated as the control group. Evaluations were carried out before and after the interventions to gauge standing knee extensors (KE) and knee flexors (KF) strength using the ForceFrame Strength Testing System. The recorded variables encompassed average, maximal force, and maximal impulse for both KE and KF. Results: Following the intervention, evaluations showed no significant differences between groups in KF maximal force (F1,48 = 1.238; p = 0.271; 𝜂2𝑝 = 0.025), KF average force (F1,48 = 0.957; p = 0.333; 𝜂2𝑝 = 0.020), KF maximal impulse (F1,48 = 0.246; p = 0.622; 𝜂2𝑝 = 0.005), KE maximal force (F1,48 = 1.514; p = 0.225; 𝜂2𝑝 = 0.031), KE average force (F1,48 = 0.118; p = 0.733; 𝜂2𝑝 = 0.002), and KE maximal impulse (F1,48 = 2.540; p = 0.118; 𝜂2𝑝 = 0.050). Analysis within the DM group showed significant differences in KF maximal force (24.2 N; p = 0.004), KF average force (23.4 N; p = 0.001), KE maximal force (25.8 N; p = 0.005), KE average force (20.0 N; p = 0.044), and KE maximal impulse (265.9 Ns; p = 0.027), although no significant differences were found in KF maximal impulse (150.1 Ns; p = 0.058). Conclusions: This study indicates that both DM and NHC elicit similar effects on acute responses in KE and KF strength following intervention, although DM shows more favorable adaptations within the group. Perhaps DM could serve as a suitable warm-up strategy in specific circumstances, immediately influencing readiness for strength activities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Main Outcome Measure: The subjects were tested for morphological and mechanical properties, expressed by thickness and stiffness of the supraspinatus tendon and muscle, and upper trapezius muscle. Moreover, acromiohumeral distance was also evaluated using B-mode ultrasound and shear-wave elastography. Intervention: The thickness and stiffness of the supraspinatus and upper trapezius muscle were assessed at 3 angles of abduction (0°, 60°, and 90°) and 3 levels of contraction (0%, 10%, and 20% of the maximal voluntary isometric contraction) using ultrasonography with shear-wave imaging. Moreover, the acromiohumeral distance was measured to establish the occupation ratio during passive movement. Results: The supraspinatus and upper trapezius muscle thickness and stiffness were significantly greater at 60° shoulder abduction compared with 0°, and 90° compared with 60°, as well as significantly greater at 20% maximal voluntary isometric contraction compared with 0% and 10% maximal voluntary isometric contraction. Thickness and stiffness were significantly greater in the supraspinatus compared with the upper trapezius muscle at all 3 angles of shoulder abduction for all 3 level of contractions. The acromiohumeral distance decreased significantly from 0° to 60° and from 60° to 90°.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) obtained in the ramp incremental exercise test and that in the verification test performed on different days at submaximal intensity. Additionally, we examined the roles of anaerobic performance and respiratory muscle strength. Methods: Sixteen physically active men participated in the study, with an average age of 22.7 ± 2.4 (years), height of 178.0 ± 7.4 (cm), and weight of 77.4 ± 7.3 (kg). They performed the three following tests on a cycle ergometer: the Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT), the ramp incremental exercise test (IETRAMP), and the verification test performed at an intensity of 85% (VER85) maximal power, which was obtained during the IETRAMP. Results: No significant difference was observed in the peak oxygen uptake between the IETRAMP and VER85 (p = 0.51). The coefficient of variation was 3.1% and the Bland–Altman analysis showed a high agreement. We found significant correlations between the total work performed in the IETRAMP, the anaerobic peak power (r = 0.52, p ≤ 0.05), and the total work obtained in the WAnT (r = 0.67, p ≤ 0.01). There were no significant differences in post-exercise changes in the strength of the inspiratory and expiratory muscles after the IETRAMP and the VER85. Conclusions: The submaximal intensity verification test performed on different days provided reliable values that confirmed the real VO2max, which was not limited by respiratory muscle fatigue. This verification test may be suggested for participants with a lower anaerobic mechanical performance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This study assessed maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), power output and sports performance in mountain bike\ncyclists applying elements of the polarized training programme (POL). Material and Methods. Seven cyclists participated in the study. Immediately before the 2-year experiment (T1), and five times during the experiment (T2, T3, T4, T5, T6), incremental and verification tests were performed to assess VO2max, peak aerobic power (Ppeak) and power at the second ventilatory threshold (PVT2). During the experiment, sports performance in mountain bike cyclists at National Championships, European Championships, World Championships, and World Cup were analyzed. The cyclists performed POL for seven months in each year of the experiment. POL included sprint interval training, high-intensity interval training, and low-intensity endurance training. Results. In the group of cyclists VO2max [l∙min-1] increased in T6 (4.14 ± 1.13) compared to T1 (3.74 ± 0.95), Ppeak [W] increased in T4, T5 and T6 (353 ± 78.45; 350.14 ± 87.96; 360.23 ± 93.83; respectively) compared to T1 (324.14 ± 90.24), and PVT2 [W] increased in T3, T4, T5 and T6 (265.57 ± 80.66; 267.29 ± 63.74; 266.43 ± 69.29; 276.71 ± 78.99; respectively) compared to T1 (229.29 ± 62.91). Cyclists’ sports performance improved during the experiment, and one of them won bronze medal at the World Championships. Conclusions. During the biseasonal experiment using elements of the polarized training programme, improvements in VO2max, Ppeak and PVT2 were observed in cyclists, which was accompanied by better sports performance in cycling races."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Distance covered and the ability to maintain breathing rhythm were evaluated by experts. For both girls and boys, the lack of goggles reduced the breath control. The boys in contrast to the girls, could \"swim\" (cover a distance) but did not have the “competence” to swim effectively/safely—with breathing rhythm—regardless of the goggle factor. Goggle-free swimming as an autonomous component of water competence is highly recommended in elementary swimming education. The following elements for pedagogical intervention in the area of water competence development are proposed: (1) the formatting of breath control on the basis of the student’s preferred, simplest form of swimming (not strokes); (2) the a priori treatment of swimming goggles as an unnecessary teaching aid; (3) the gender differences in area of both adaptation in visual perception (the goggles factor) and motor control (breath control factor) should be considered."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Apart from support from scientists and practitioners, the CI effect has also faced skepticism. Therefore, we aimed to review the existing literature on the CI effect and determine how it affects transfer in laboratory and applied settings and in different age groups. We found 1,287 articles in the following databases: Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, supplemented by the Google Scholar search engine and manual search. Of 300 fully screened articles, 42 studies were included in the systematic review and 34 in the quantitative analysis (meta-analysis). The overall CI effect on transfer in motor learning was medium (SMD = 0.55), favoring random practice. Random practice was favored in the laboratory and applied settings. However, in laboratory studies, the medium effect size was statistically significant (SMD = 0.75), whereas, in applied studies, the effect size was small and statistically non-significant (SMD = 0.34). Age group analysis turned out to be significant only in adults and older adults. In both, the random practice was favored. In adults, the effect was medium (SMD = 0.54), whereas in older adults was large (SMD = 1.28). In young participants, the effect size was negligible (SMD = 0.12)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This systematic review aims to explore the link between posture and heart rate variability and evaluate potential interventions to address the consequences of sedentary lifestyles.

Eligibility criteria: People aged 18 years or above with a sedentary lifestyle were included. Studies involving children or participants with spinal/musculoskeletal conditions impacting their ability to walk or sit were excluded as they would not accurately reflect posture analysis. PRISMA guidelines were followed throughout, and the quality assessment was achieved using the QualSyst tool. (3) Results: Out of the 753 papers identified, only five met the eligibility criteria. These studies exhibited heterogeneity regarding interventions, aims, and participant populations. All five studies were prospective case series, enabling analysis and comparisons.

Reducing the duration of stimulation through HCT can help optimize recovery processes in sports. Methods: Twenty male MMA fighters (26.5 ± 4.5 years, BMI 24.75 ± 3.0, training experience: 10.3 ± 5.0 years) performed two experimental sessions: (a) 5 min heat-compression therapy (HCT) stimulation (GR-HCT-5); and (b) 10 min heat-compression therapy (GR-HCT-10). All registered parameters, tissue perfusion (PU), tissue temperature (°C), muscle tone (T-Hz) stiffness (S—N/m), elasticity (E—arb), pressure pain threshold (PPT—N/cm) and isometric muscle strength (Fmax—kgf), were measured at rest (r—2 min before GR-HCT stimulation) and 1 min after GR-HCT (p-post) for the flexor carpi radialis muscle (MFCR) and the brachioradialis muscle (MBR). Results: The Friedman’s test for MBR revealed significant differences between GR-HCT5min vs. GR-HCT10min for PU (p < 0.0001), S (p = 0.008), and for MBR and MFCR for °C (p < 0.0001). The pairwise comparisons for PU, S, and °C showed significant differences between rest vs. post values for 5 min as well as between rest vs. post values for 10 min. Further, there was a significant interaction effect (5 min-10 min × Rest-Post p < 0.0001) for PU for MFCR. The post hoc comparison for the interaction effect showed significantly higher PU for post- compared to premeasurement in 5 min PU and 10 min PU (p < 0.001). Further, there was a significant main effect of condition for Fmax both for MFCR and MBR (5 min vs. 10 min p < 0.001); The post hoc comparison for the main effect of condition showed a significantly higher Fmax for post- compared to premeasurement in 5 min and 10 min (p < 0.001). Further, there was a significant main effect of condition for pressure pain threshold [N/cm] both for MFCR and MBR and for T for MBR time of measurement rest vs. post (p < 0.001; p = 0.006; p < 0.001, respectively). The post hoc comparison for the interaction effect showed a significantly lower PPT for post vs. rest in 5 min (p < 0.001 only for MFCR) and in 10 min (p < 0.001). The delta values for PU (post-rest) and ΔTemp °C showed significant differences between the 5 min and 10 min conditions (MFCR; p < 0.0001); (MBR p < 0.001) and (MFCR p < 0.0001); (MBR p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our results show that GR-HCT significantly affects recovery of muscle biomechanical parameters, pain threshold, strength, tissue perfusion, and temperature. Our findings show that a 5 min effect can be sufficient when compared to a 10 min one which is a clue for designing effective recovery protocols."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Szczególne znaczenie przypisywane jest technikom, które stymulują regenerację tkanki chrzęstnej i proces osteogenezy. Celem pracy jest omówienie innowacyjnej metody terapeutycznej MBST®, wykorzystującej energię jądrową rezonansu magnetycznego. Terapia skupia się na oddziaływaniu na tkanki chrzęstne, kostne i mięśniowe, stymulując ich metabolizm i przyspieszając naturalne procesy naprawcze. Metoda MBST® opiera się na zasadach rezonansu magnetycznego, które są podobne do wykorzystywanych w badaniach MRI (ang. magnetic resonanse imaging). Odróżnia się ona jednak zastosowaniem specyficznych częstotliwości, które mają stymulować komórki do regeneracji. Terapia MBST® reprezentuje innowacyjne podejście do leczenia schorzeń narządu ruchu, oferując pacjentom skuteczną i bezpieczną alternatywę dla tradycyjnych metod. Innowacyjność techniki MBST® polega na koncentracji na źródle problemu, nie tylko na łagodzeniu objawów. Dodatkową jej zaletą jest fakt, że nie wykazała ona do tej pory efektów ubocznych. Wraz z rozwojem technologii i pogłębianiem wiedzy na temat metody MBST® istnieje szansa na jej szersze zastosowanie i poprawę jakości życia wielu osób. Kluczowe znaczenie ma świadome podejście pacjentów, fizjoterapeutów i lekarzy do możliwości i ograniczeń, jakie niesie ze sobą ta terapia."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the context of the frequency of musculoskeletal dysfunctions, it is necessary to implement new therapeutic methods, the priority of which is to alleviate pain, improve joint mobility and combat the development of the disease process. Particular importance is attached to techniques that stimulate the regeneration of cartilage tissue and the osteogenesis process. The aim of the work is to discuss the innovative therapeutic method MBST®, which uses nuclear magnetic resonance energy. The therapy focuses on affecting cartilage, bone and muscle tissues, stimulating their metabolism and accelerating natural repair processes. The MBST® method is based on the principles of magnetic resonance imaging, which are similar to those used in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) studies. However, it differs in the use of specific frequencies that are intended to stimulate cells to regenerate. MBST® therapy represents an innovative approach to the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, offering patients an effective and safe alternative to traditional methods. The innovation of the MBST® technique lies in focusing on the source of the problem, not only on relieving the symptoms. An additional advantage is the fact that it has not shown any side effects so far. As technology develops and knowledge about the MBST® method deepens, there is a chance for its wider application and improvement of the quality of life of many people. A conscious approach of patients, physiotherapists and doctors to the possibilities and limitations of this therapy is crucial."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Methods: In the examined children, the general and segmental body composition and body posture were determined using a physiotherapeutic assessment based on the Kasperczyk method. Mass, overall, and segmental body composition were determined using the bioelectrical impedance method using a TANITA body composition analyzer. The study group of 76 children was divided due to body weight disorders into Group I (n = 51), in which BMI and fat mass values were within the normative limits for age and gender, and Group II (n = 19), comprising children whose body weight exceeded the norm and/or fat mass exceeded normative values. The examined children underwent a physioprophylactic. The program was conducted by qualified physiotherapists for 12 weeks, once a week for 30 min. The therapeutic program was focused on physioprevention of being overweight and the correction of body posture. Results: A distal distribution of fat mass was observed in the examined group. Asymmetry in the sagittal plane was found in 35% of children. No statistically significant differences were found in the presence of asymmetry in the sagittal plane between the groups. No statistically significant differences were found in the occurrence of posture irregularities between the groups. Conclusions: There were no changes in the weight and body posture of the examined children under the influence of the physiotherapy program. The lack of correlation in the examined group between body weight and posture irregularities in 5–6-year-olds may suggest the acquisition of posture defects as a consequence of the persistence of overweight or obesity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Veinte atletas entrenados de tiro con arco (hombres: 14, edad: 32.1±6.6 años; mujeres: 6, edad: 25.3±5.0 años) participaron en este estudio experimental. Los atletas realizaron 100 disparos de tiro con arco, después de lo cual recibieron terapia manual regenerativa. Se tomaron medidas de EMG del deltoides medio, deltoides posterior, trapecio superior, trapecio medio, trapecio inferior y músculo infraespinoso antes de los disparos, después de los disparos y después de la terapia manual. Los resultados medidos incluyeron la amplitud media y máxima del valor cuadrático medio de la EMG (EMGRMS) y la frecuencia mediana del espectro de potencia de la señal EMG de superficie cruda (EMGMED). Las comparaciones entre sexos revelaron una EMGMED significativamente mayor en el trapecio superior después de la terapia manual en mujeres en comparación con hombres (F=5.096; p=0.037). No se encontraron otras diferencias significativas entre sexos (p>0.05). Las mediciones repetidas realizadas en la línea de base, después de 100 disparos y después de la terapia manual mostraron una amplitud media EMGRMS significativamente mayor en el infraespinoso después de la terapia manual en comparación con después de 100 disparos (169.7 vs. 109.8 µV; p=0.008). Se observaron resultados similares para la amplitud máxima EMGRMS (372.7 vs. 209.5 µV; p=0.010). Además, se observó una amplitud máxima EMGRMS significativamente menor en la línea de base en comparación con después de la terapia manual en el trapecio inferior (312.6 vs. 551.2 µV; p=0.045). En resumen, y en general, la terapia manual no jugó un papel significativo en la restauración de los parámetros de EMG en los músculos primarios de los arqueros después de la exposición a una condición de fatiga.

Twenty trained archery athletes (men: 14, age: 32.1±6.6 years; women: 6, age: 25.3±5.0 years) participated in this experimental study. The athletes were subjected to 100 archery shots, after which they received regenerative manual therapy. EMG measurements were taken from the middle deltoid, posterior deltoid, upper trapezius, middle trapezius, lower trapezius, and infraspinatus muscles before the shots, after the shots, and after the manual therapy. The outcomes measured included the mean and maximal amplitude of the EMG root mean square (EMGRMS) and the median frequency of the raw surface EMG signal power spectrum (EMGMED). Sex comparisons revealed a significantly higher EMGMED in the upper trapezius following manual therapy in women compared to men (F=5.096; p=0.037). No other significant differences were found between sexes (p>0.05). Repeated measures conducted at baseline, after 100 shots, and after manual therapy showed a significantly greater mean amplitude EMGRMS in the infraspinatus following manual therapy compared to after 100 shots (169.7 vs. 109.8 µV; p=0.008). Similar results were noted for maximal amplitude EMGRMS (372.7 vs. 209.5 µV; p=0.010). Additionally, a significantly lower maximal amplitude EMGRMS was observed at baseline compared to after manual therapy in low trapezius (312.6 vs. 551.2 µV; p=0.045). In summary, and overall, manual therapy did not play a significant role in restoring the EMG parameters in the primary muscles of archers after exposure to a fatigue condition. However, it showed efficacy in the case of the infraspinatus. Furthermore, apart from the upper trapezius, no significant effects were observed between genders, indicating similar effects in both."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

A prospective, randomized, controlled single-blind study design was used. Twenty professional MMA fighters were included in the study. The experimental group (n = 10) was subjected to the CHCP protocol (eGR), while the control group (cGR) (n = 10) was subjected to sham therapy. Both protocols consisted of three CHCP sessions performed immediately after plyometric exercise, 24 and 48 h afterwards. Measurements were taken at the following time points: 1) at rest; 2) 1 min post-exercise; 3) 1 min post-CHCP therapy; 4) 24 h postCHCP therapy; 5) 48 h post-CHCP therapy. The results of the eGR compared to the cGR showed significantly higher\nperfusion at time point 5 (p < 0.001), higher muscle tone at time points 1, and 3–5 (p < 0.001 for all), higher stiffness at time points 1, 3–5 (p < 0.001 for all) and a higher pain threshold at time points 1 and 5 (p < 0.001 for all).

The following tests were performed three times: MIP, MEP, Borg RPE scale and swimming test: T-30 test; 8 × 100 progressive test. \nResults: There was a significant increase in the MIP and MEP in group I after IMT. There was a significant increase in the distance swam during the T-30 only in group I after IMT. Significant differences were found between the first and third measurements in group I, and the effect was maintained at follow-up. There was also a significant reduction in La concentration in group I after IMT. There was a significant reduction in heart rate at 88% and 93% of the maximum speed in group I after the applied training. \nConclusion: Inspiratory muscle training with 50% of the maximum inspiratory pressure load significantly increased the respiratory muscle strength of disabled swimmers.

Understanding the physical, physiological, and technical demands on soccer players according to their positional role during competitive matches is necessary to understand match requirements and develop position-specific training practices. Thereby, there is a clear need to synthesize the information on the different profiles of each playing position. Objective: This review aimed to organize the literature investigating physical, physiological, and technical demands according to playing positions and provide a framework to identify gaps and suggestions for future studies. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in October 2023 using four electronic databases: Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, PubMed and Scopus. The review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines and the PRISMA-ScR extension for Scoping Reviews. The studies were included if the sample comprised adult male soccer players categorized from Tier 3 to Tier 5 (i.e., highly trained/national level, elite/international level, or world class) and compared the physical, physiological, or technical parameters across playing positions. Results: A total of 178 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The number of teams, players, and matches analyzed per study varied considerably. Although a range of classifications were reported across studies, 59% of studies classified players as central defenders, full-backs, central midfielders, wide midfielders, and forwards. The findings suggests that central and external midfielders, and external defenders cover greater total and high-speed distance than forwards or central defenders. Sprint distance was higher in external midfielders versus all other positions. Defenders and central midfielders perform more passes than external midfielders and forwards. Heart rate was the most commonly reported physiological variable across playing positions. When expressed as a percentage of maximal heart rate, midfielders presented higher mean values than all other playing positions. Conclusion: This scoping review demonstrates that there are differences in the demands on players across playing positions in soccer. Training practices in soccer should be based on the specific requirements of each positional role to ensure players can fulfill their tactical responsibilities during the game."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

However, limited research exists on evaluating foot mobility asymmetry as a potential predictor of such injuries. This study aimed to (1) assess the frequency of foot mobility asymmetries among amateur athletes, (2) investigate the predictive value of foot mobility asymmetry (measured via navicular height drop) for injury risk, and (3) explore the relationship between foot type and injury occurrence. A cross-sectional sampling method was employed to select 45 physically active male amateur athletes (runners and team sports practitioners) from a university. Injury history was retrospectively recorded, and a modified navicular drop test was conducted to classify foot arch height. The predictive power of navicular height drop asymmetry was analyzed using ROC curves, and the relationship between foot type (neutral and defective combinations—pronated or supinated) and injury occurrence was examined using chi-square tests for independence. Multiple logistic regression was applied to calculate injury risk odds ratios across different foot type subgroups. The results revealed a significant frequency (51.1%) of participants with at least one defective foot, including 31.1% with one neutral and one defective foot and 20% with both feet defective. Navicular height drop asymmetry emerged as a valuable predictor of injuries, with a 36% asymmetry identified as the cut-off for increased injury risk (AUC = 0.832, 95% CI: 0.691–0.973, p < 0.001). A significant relationship was found between foot type and injury occurrence. Only one out of 22 participants with neutral feet (4.55%) experienced an injury, compared to 9 out of 14 (64.29%) with one neutral and one defective foot and 5 out of 9 (55.56%) with both feet defective. These differences were statistically significant (χ2 = 16.24, p < 0.001, Cramer’s V = 0.60). The odds ratio for injury risk was 37.8 (p = 0.016) for those with asymmetry (one neutral and one defective foot) and 26.3 (p = 0.102) for those with both feet defective, compared to participants with both feet neutral. In clinical practice, these findings suggest that routine screenings for physically active individuals should incorporate foot mobility asymmetry assessment. However, it is essential to integrate this factor with other risk indicators. For individuals exhibiting high asymmetry, general foot defect correction programs may be beneficial, but injury prevention strategies should adopt a more comprehensive approach, focusing on overall fitness and tailored interventions for high-risk individuals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

There is strong evidence suggesting that Post-Activation Performance Enhancement (PAPE) can acutely enhance arious aspects of sports performance, such as strength, endurance, speed, and agility. However, there is a gap in research regarding the effects of PAPE on reaction time performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PAPE on the visual reaction time performances of amateur boxers.\nMaterial and Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 17 amateur boxers. Anthropometric measurements were taken, and participants performed a 1-RM Bench Press performance test preceded by 5 minutes of low-intensity running. The PAPE protocol was then administered 72 hours later after another 5 minutes of low-intensity running to avoid fatigue. Visual reaction time was measured immediately before the PAPE protocol and six times at 3-minute intervals afterward. Data were analyzed using IBM Statistics (SPSS, ver. 26.0, Armonk, NY, USA) software.\nResults. The study found that although there was a difference in the mean visual reaction time performance of participants before and after the PAPE protocol, this difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Therefore, it can be concluded that PAPE does not have an enhancing effect on the visual reaction time performance of boxers.\nConclusions. In conclusion, this study suggests that PAPE does not significantly affect visual reaction time performance in amateur boxers. Further research may be warranted to explore other factors that may influence reaction time in this population."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Wojna w sferze wizualnej i aksjologicznej podszywa się pod gry wideo. Prowadzi to do dehumanizacji ofiar, które przestają być postrzegane jako istoty ludzkie, stając się zbiorem animowanych pikseli. Znacząca część sztuki filmowej odnoszącej się do wojny wydaje się podążać w kierunku przedstawiania wojny jako tła dla barwnych przygód młodych mężczyzn, a nawet romansu. Wojny zostają sprowadzone do techniki i kosztu realizacji celu, bez uznania tragedii w wymiarze humanitarnym, który dotyka absolutnie wszystkich jej uczestników i świadków.\nO jeden most za daleko (reż. Richard Attenborough, 1977) jest zapisem klęski potężnej alianckiej operacji lądowo-desantowej z okresu II wojny światowej. Fiasko jest przedstawione w wymiarze strategicznym, taktycznym i osobistym żołnierzy. Film przedstawia wojnę w kontekście nieracjonalnych decyzji, które nie liczą się z kosztami najtragiczniejszymi z możliwych, czyli kosztami życia ludzkiego. Film powstał jako autokrytyka aliantów, co samo w sobie obecnie jest mało spotykane."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the 21st century, the representation of war in media messages is becoming progressively softer, and its tragic costs are accepted by developed societies whose policies cause and support armed conflicts. War in the visual and axiological sphere impersonates video games. This leads to the dehumanization of victims, who are no longer perceived as human beings and become a collection of animated pixels. Much of the art of film relating to war seems to be moving in the direction of presenting war as a backdrop for young men’s colorful adventures and even romance. Wars are reduced to technology and the cost of achieving the goal, without recognizing the tragedy in its humanitarian dimension, which affects absolutely all its participants and witnesses.\nA Bridge Too Far (directed by Richard Attenborough, 1977) is a record of the failure of a powerful Allied amphibious operation during World War II. The fiasco is presented in terms of the strategic, tactical and personal dimensions of the soldiers. The film presents war in the context of irrational decisions that do not take into account the most tragic possible costs, i.e. the costs of human life. The film was created as a self-criticism of the Allies, which in itself is rarely seen nowadays."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The purpose of this study was to analyse the principal indicators, with a special focus on comparing the playing style of women and men high-level players. Methods: twenty matches played by 40 women, and twenty matches played by 40 men were analysed in slow motion by an expert coach. All the players were in the top 111(W) and 120 (M) positions of the ITTF world ranking; Results: women play more shots/rallies and shots/games compared to men. The most used shots are Top forehand and Serve for both groups. Women also prefer to play backhand block and drive. Conversely, men prefer to counterattack with forehand Top C Top. One step is often used by women, and they also prefer to hit the ball without performing any step. Conversely, men perform crossover and pivot footwork. Serves are generally directed to close-to-the-net areas, and the following shots are typically directed to the backhand corner during the rallies. Conclusions: Women showed a specific distribution of technical indicators with respect to men players, suggesting sex-specific training sessions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Directly before the test and during the break after each load, blood was collected to determine lactate concentration ([LA]) and serotonin concentration (SER). The heart rate (HR), pulmonary ventilation (Ve) and oxygen up-take (VO2) were recorded and the psychomotor test was performed. Measurements were carried out: (1) at rest, (2) at the lactate threshold (T[LA]), (3) at the threshold of psychomotor fatigue (TPF), and (4) at maximum intensity. Percentage differences between maximum intensity (100%) and the values of the tested parameters recorded at the T[LA] and TPF were also calculated. The tests were conducted in a climatic chamber at an ambient temperature of 28.5°C, with a relative air humidity of 58.7%.\n\nResults: It was confirmed that the TPF, which reflects the highest efficiency of the central nervous system, occurs at a higher running speed than the T[LA].

Cognitive function, including reaction time, motor time, and eye–hand coordination, plays a crucial role in e-athlete performance. This study aims to examine the impact of VR training on these cognitive functions in amateur e-athletes. Methods: The study involved 66 amateur e-athletes (45 men and 21 women, aged 19–41, with a mean age of 23.96 ± 3.90 years) who reported active, non-professional involvement in esports. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group (E) (n = 32) and a control group (C) (n = 34), with initial comparisons confirming no significant differences in daily gaming habits, esports experience, or age between groups. The E group completed 15-minute daily training sessions using the VR game Beat Saber over eight consecutive days. Results: The results demonstrated that VR training significantly improved eye–hand coordination in the experimental group, although there were no notable effects on reaction time or motor time. Conclusions: These findings suggest that VR training may be an effective method to enhance certain cognitive functions, specifically eye–hand coordination, among amateur e-athletes. This could offer a valuable approach for performance improvement in this rapidly growing field."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Methods: The authors presented basic somatic characteristics of anthropology metrics, advanced research results obtained with the Optojump measuring system, players’ results statistics obtained with the Data Volley software (v.4.2024.01), and by applying scientific statistical methods and graphics interpretation. Results: The analyses with the Kruskal-Wallis test showed statistically significant differences in all the variables studied. Flight time (TF, H = 122.967; p < 0.001.) was the shortest for the players in the libero position, then the setter, attacker, middle and longest flight time was shown by the receiving players. The height of the jumps (JH, H = 123.018; p < 0.001) was the highest for receiving and mid players, and then attackers and setters, and the lowest jumps were recorded by libero players. The highest power of lower limbs (P, H = 20.392; p < 0.001) was characteristic for receivers, setters, mid-players and, curiously, libero achieved a better result than attackers. Conclusions: The analysis shows that the power of the lower extremities in volleyball players is associated with the function they perform on the court."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Each 8-week POL program consisted of sprint interval training (SIT) consisting of 8–12 repetitions, each lasting 30 seconds at maximal intensity, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) consisting of 4–6 repetitions, each lasting 4 minutes at an intensity of 90–100% maximal aerobic power, and low-intensity endurance training (LIT) lasting 150–180 minutes with intensity at the first ventilatory threshold. Training sessions were organized into 4-day microcycles (1st day—SIT, 2nd day—HIIT, 3rd day—LIT, and 4th day—active rest), that were repeated throughout the experiment. In the first POL program, exercise repetitions during SIT and HIIT training were performed with freely chosen cadence above 80 RPM (POLFC group, n = 12), while in the second POL program with low cadence 50–70 RPM (POLLC group, n = 12). Immediately before and after the 8-week POL intervention, participants performed an incremental test to measure maximal aerobic power (Pmax), power achieved at the second ventilatory threshold (VT2), maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), maximal pulmonary ventilation (VEmax), and gross efficiency (GE). Moreover, participants performed VO2max verification test. Analysis of variance showed a repeated measures effect for Pmax (F = 21.62; η2 = 0.5; p = 0.00), VO2max (F = 39.39; η2 = 0.64; p = 0.00) and VEmax (F = 5.99; η2 = 0.21; p = 0.02). A repeated measures x group mixed effect was demonstrated for Pmax (F = 4.99; η2 = 0.18; p = 0.03) and VO2max (F = 6.67; η2 = 0.23; p = 0.02). Post-hoc Scheffe analysis showed that increase in Pmax were statistically significant only in POLLC group. The Friedman test showed that VT2 differed between repeated measures only in the POLLC group (χ2 = 11; p = 0.001; W = 0.917). In conclusion, it was found that POL program where SIT and HIIT were performed at low cadence was more effective in improving aerobic capacity in well-trained female cyclists, than POL with SIT and HIIT performed at freely chosen cadence. This finding is a practical application for athletes and coaches in cycling, to consider not only the intensity and duration but also the cadence used during various interval training sessions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the carbohydrate MR intervention on psychophysiological responses and kinematic profiles during intermittent (INT) and continuous (CON) 4-a-side small-sided soccer games (SSGs). Methods: Thirty-two adolescent soccer players (age: 16.5 ± 0.5 years) played six bouts of 4-a-side SSGs with MRINT or MRCON at 3-day intervals in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, and crossover study design. Psychophysiological responses and kinematic profiles were continuously recorded during all games. The rating of perceived exertion (RPE), the rating scale of mental effort (RSME), and the physical enjoyment scores (PES) were also determined at the end of each game. Results: The MRCON induced higher psychophysiological responses such as RPE, internal training load (ITL), and RSME (p ≤ 0.05, d values ranging from 0.50 to 1.04 [small to moderate effect]). Conversely, the MRINT induced higher PES (p ≤ 0.05, d values = 1.44 [large effect]) compared to MRCON. Although the MR intervention led to similar improvements in the performance of 4-a-side MRINT and MRCON, there was no significant difference between the groups. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the MR intervention can be used as an effective ergogenic supplement for acute game performance enhancement, regardless of the game’s structure."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Personality traits significantly influence athletic performance and the development of athletes. However, these traits vary at different levels of sport. This knowledge gap makes it difficult to effectively tailor training and support programs. Thus, the purpose of this article is to identify differences in the expression of personality traits among professional athletes, competitive athletes, and amateur athletes. Material and Methods. The respondents (N=83) were sport seniors from Poland, aged 23 years, studying at the Wroclaw University of Health and Sport Sciences. They were classified into three groups: 1) n=23 professional athletes; 2) n=30 competitive athletes; and 3) n=30 amateur athletes. The Big Five model was used, and the NEO-FFI personality questionnaire was administered. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 27.0, with a statistical significance level set at α = 0.05. Results. Differences in neuroticism intensity among athletes from different sport levels were noted. Professional athletes showed the lowest level of neuroticism. However, no differences were observed in the intensity of individual personality traits among athletes by gender. Furthermore, correlations were noted between sport level and athletes’ personality traits: neuroticism (strong and negative), extraversion (weak and positive), and conscientiousness (weak and positive). Conclusions. Findings underscore the importance of considering personality traits when developing tailored training and support programs for athletes. The absence of gender differences in personality traits suggests that such programs can be designed without gender-specific adjustments. The identified correlations between sport level and personality traits provide valuable insights for coaches and sport psychologists to better understand and support athletes' psychological profiles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The aims of this study were to investigate the relationship between cognitive factors and agility performance in this unique population. Methods: 39 young soccer players age 13.56 (SD 0.58) years were assessed for leg-muscle function (jump tests) and maturation status (peak height velocity). The Y-Agility Test, which included decision making in players, was used to measure performance. Cognitive factors such as perceptual skills and decision making were evaluated with the Y-Agility Test. Results: The linear regression showed an absence of significance between the Y-Agility Test and drop-jump contact (P = .283), Y-Agility Test and drop-jump flight (P = .185), Y-Agility Test and squat jump (P = .868), and Y-Agility Test and countermovement jump (P = .310). The linear mixed-model analyses suggested a difference between early-average maturers (P = .009) and early-late maturers (P = .005) but did not show a difference between average-late subjects (P = 1.000). Drop-jump flight did not show a difference in maturation (early-average P = 1.000; early-late P = 1.000; average P = 1.000). Squat-jump performance did not demonstrate any significance (early-average P = .618; early-late P = 1.000; P = 1.000). Countermovement-jump performance did not show any significance (early-average P = 1.000; early-late P = 1.000; average-late P = .492). Finally, agility performance does not show any significance between maturation levels (early-average maturer P = .450; early-late P = 1.000; average-late P = .830). Conclusion: Agility in young soccer players appears to follow a nonlinear trajectory, with cognitive factors possibly playing a more significant role than previously thought."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The effectiveness of psychological interventions in CR is debated, and while technologies like virtual reality (VR) therapy show promise, they have limitations for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, this study examines non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) relaxation, a novel and easily implementable technique, and compares its impact on depression, anxiety, and stress with VR therapy and standard care. Methods: Forty-five CAD patients undergoing CR in ambulatory conditions were divided into three groups: the NSDR group, which received eight sessions of NSDR relaxation as part of their rehabilitation; the VR group, which received eight sessions of VR therapy as part of their rehabilitation; and the control group, which received standard care including Schultz Autogenic Training (SAT). The outcomes were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Perception of Stress Questionnaire (PSQ). Results: Both NSDR relaxation and VR therapy were effective in reducing the HADS total score, anxiety levels, the PSQ general score, and emotional tension. No significant differences were observed between the two treatment approaches. However, SAT was found to be insufficient for effectively improving the mental state of cardiac patients. Conclusions: This study suggests that NSDR relaxation is an effective psychotherapeutic intervention in CR. NSDR and VR therapy showed similar benefits, offering promising alternatives to traditional methods. Integrating these techniques could enhance patient outcomes and adherence in CR. Further research is needed to refine these interventions and optimize their clinical application."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Biathletes generated forces more accurate and exhibit\nbetter repeatability of produced forces than runners. Mean force measured in fatigue conditions, for\nboth groups, did not vary significantly from rest measurements. Before testing biathletes exhibited\nsignificantly lower REE and LEE, and after testing lower REF and LEF variability than runners.\nAfter testing there was a significant drop of variability in elbows flexion but not extension and\nRKE in biathletes. Insignificant downward trend of variability parameters were found in runners.\nThe presented findings corroborate sport-specific force generation ability alteration in response to\nexhaustive effort. Tracking force generation over time may be useful in the monitoring of training loads\nand specific training adaptations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This perspective critically examines psychoanalytic psychotherapy as a method for restoring athletes' psychological well-being after experiencing negative effects from social media use. The paper characterizes the key elements of psychoanalytic psychotherapy relevant to athletes, discusses the role of the psychoanalytic psychotherapist in working with athletes and describes the specifics of the psychoanalytic therapeutic process in this context. The potential advantages of psychoanalytic approaches over cognitive-behavioral methods are examined in treating the psychological impacts of problematic social media use among athletes. The analysis suggests that hate speech and negative online interactions can activate athletes' unprocessed life experiences rooted in early developmental stages. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy may offer a particularly effective method for restoring athletes' psychological wellbeing in such cases by addressing deep-rooted intrapsychic conflicts. However, a comprehensive approach integrating multiple therapeutic modalities is recommended to address the complex challenges athletes face in the digital age. This perspective acknowledges limitations in current research and suggest directions for future studies to develop and validate tailored interventions for athletes grappling with social media-related psychological distress."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The generalised mixed linear modelling was used to estimate the mean change of each of 40 physical and technical performance-related parameters of soccer teams from the first half of the match to the second, controlling the effects of match status, match location, team strength and opponent strength. Results showed that, out of the selected 40 parameters, only goals (first half vs second half M ± SD: 0.60 ± 0.76 vs 0.82 ± 0.92, ES; ±99% confidence limits: 0.21; ±0.05), shots (5.7 ± 2.8 vs 6.8 ± 3.3, 0.34; ±0.05), individual possession in the attacking third (55 ± 21 vs 62 ± 25, 0.31; ±0.05), cross (9.7 ± 4.6 vs 10.9 ± 5.8, 0.24; ±0.06) and yellow cards (0.75 ± 0.84 vs 1.24 ± 1.07, 0.45; ±0.06) showed substantially increment from the first half to the second, other parameters presented only trivial changes. Hence, it is concluded that the physical performance of soccer teams in the second half did not show meaningful change, while technical actions related to attacking tended to increase. The findings can offer soccer coaches valuable insights into when and how to adjust their tactics, manage their players, thus can maintain or enhance the team’s match performance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Thirty-two trained/developmental men MMA fighters (25.5±4.5 years; 24.5±3 body mass index) participated in a randomized crossover study. Participants underwent a single intervention, receiving both DN and placebo. Laser Doppler flowmetry measured blood perfusion, while a myotonometer assessed the mechanical characteristics of muscle tone, stiffness, and elasticity of the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were measured using an algometer, and maximal forearm muscle force was measured using a hand dynamometer. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, immediately after, and 24 hours and 48 hours post-intervention. A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant Intervention*Time interaction for all outcomes: perfusion unit (p<0.001), muscle tone (p<0.001), stiffness (p<0.001), elasticity (p<0.001), PPT (p<0.001) and maximal forearm muscle force (p<0.001). The current study suggests that a single session of DN enhances muscle recovery, increases muscle strength, and improved PPT in MMA athletes.

This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the efficacy of internet- and mobile-based interventions for post-acute care in these conditions.\n\nMethods: A systematic search was conducted in electronic databases (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PsycEXTRA, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Open, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and Open Grey) for randomized controlled trials evaluating digital aftercare or relapse prevention interventions for adults with anxiety or depressive disorders. Primary outcomes included symptom severity, relapse rates, recurrence rates, and rehospitalization. Secondary outcomes included general quality of life and adherence to primary treatment. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool.\n\nResults: Nineteen studies (3,206 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Interventions included cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based approaches, and supportive text messaging. Most studies focused on depression, with limited evidence for anxiety disorders. Notably, fourteen studies that reported on depressive symptoms demonstrated significant improvements following digital interventions, with effect sizes ranging from small (Cohen’s d = 0.20) to large (Cohen’s d = 0.80). Five studies investigated relapse or recurrence rates, yielding mixed results. Adherence rates varied significantly across studies, ranging from 50 to 92.3%, highlighting the variability in participant engagement. Methodological quality was also variable, with allocation concealment and blinding being common limitations.\n\nConclusion: Internet- and mobile-based interventions show promise for aftercare and relapse prevention in depression, with limited evidence for anxiety disorders. Future research should focus on optimizing engagement, personalizing interventions, standardizing outcome measures, and conducting larger trials with longer follow-up periods.

Therefore, the aim of this article is to learn more about the health effects of karate training based on a review of current research. Methods: The Scopus database was searched from 2000 onwards for available articles related only to karate. The following intermediate phrases were not included: combat sport, fighting art, hand-to-hand combat, martial art, and self-defence system. The filter used was desk review analysis. Only 14 scientific articles (research papers and review papers) strictly on karate were found. The method of source material analysis and critical analysis of the source text was then used. Results: It was shown that kumite appears to require significantly more metabolic power than kata. Furthermore, the greater skill of karatekas is associated with their greater physical fitness, and long-term karate training attenuates the decline in dynamic visual acuity (DVA). The role of modified and individualised forms of karate training is also highlighted as important for the health of practitioners. Furthermore, long-term karate practice is associated with extensive modulation of immunological parameters. Karate training can also significantly improve motor skills. It can also play an important role in the development of willpower and personality traits that contribute to the well-being of its practitioners. Furthermore, nutritional and psychological interventions combined with karate training may improve cardiometabolic parameters, oxidative stress and inflammation. Karate training may also contribute to the prevention of osteoporosis and strengthen the left ventricular myocardium. Conclusions: It was found that there is a paucity of contemporary research on the health effects of karate training. In addition, they are limited to the individuals studied, so that generalisations about these effects in the general population of karate practitioners cannot be made."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The primary aim is to quantify the extent to which asymmetrical movements serve as predictors of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) among these workers and their overall well-being. The study emphasises the predictive relationships between asymmetry metrics and health outcomes. (2) Methods: The study included 86 employees from an automotive manufacturing plant, categorised into machining workers (MWEs) and assembly workers (AWEs). The employment duration spanned from 6 months to 40 years. Inertial motion capture technology was employed alongside the Goldberg 28-item General Health Questionnaire for a retrospective observational analysis and assessment of worker well-being. Movement dynamics were evaluated using a Motion Activity Index (MAI) to measure movement intensity, asymmetry, and quality. (3) Results: The machining group demonstrated nearly double the range of motion (median ROM: 36.6° vs. 25.5°, p = 0.019) and peak angular velocities up to eight times higher (median: 40°/s vs. 5°/s) in lumbar and thoracic rotations compared to the assembly group. Significant differences in ROM and movement speeds were observed (p < 0.001). The MAI showed higher dynamic and symmetrical movements in the machining group (36.6% vs. 25.5%, p = 0.019). No significant mental health issues were identified, aside from complaints related to somatic symptoms. (4) Conclusions: This study highlights significant occupational risks due to movement asymmetry in industrial settings, revealing substantial differences in joint angular displacements, velocities, and accelerations between machining and assembly workers. The findings emphasise the importance of targeted ergonomic interventions to enhance worker well-being and advocate for preventive health measures in occupational environments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Building on previous research, our study examines whether the perceived identity leadership of coaches and athlete leaders is associated with a range of key performance indicators (notably team and individual performance and effort) through team identification and team cohesion. We also examine if these relationships are generalisable across WEIRD (Westernised, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic) and non-WEIRD countries while looking at whether they vary as a function of national culture (i.e., ingroup collectivism). To this end, we collected data from 3,135 football players across 211 teams in nine countries who engaged in an average of 4.02 sessions per week (SD = 2.03). Data were analysed using multilevel (multigroup) regressions and indicated that coaches' and athlete leaders' perceived identity leadership was associated with all performance indicators via both team identification and cohesion. For the most part, these relationships held across WEIRD and non-WEIRD countries. However, we also found some evidence that the relationships between identity leadership and performance varied cross-culturally and were generally stronger in countries high on ingroup collectivism. Together, these data suggest that identity leaders—across geographical and cultural borders—can make teams more effective and that they achieve this by leveraging ‘our’ strength in ways that make ‘us’ more cohesive."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This study aimed to assess the level of physical activity and exercise capacity in patients with haematological malignancies who were qualified for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: A prospective, single-centre study was conducted on patients with haematological malignancies qualified for HSCT (study group, n = 103) and a cohort of healthy volunteers (reference group, n = 100). The assessment protocol included the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Results: The median age was 57 years in the study group and 56 years in the reference group. In the IPAQ assessment, at least 50% of the study group reported no engagement in moderate or intense physical activity. In the 6MWT, the study group demonstrated a significantly shorter walking distance compared to the reference group (p < 0.0001). Factors such as group membership (study vs. reference group), age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) were found to have a significant impact on 6MWT performance. No significant differences were observed in IPAQ or 6MWT results among subgroups within the study group when categorized by diagnosis. Conclusions: Patients with haematological malignancies who qualified for HSCT often show physical activity levels below recommended standards, which can negatively impact their ability to endure physical exertion. Insufficient activity prior to transplantation may contribute to reduced exercise capacity. Therefore, prehabilitation programmes aimed at improving physical activity and structured exercise should be an integral part of their care."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Moral education of youth is one of the key components in shaping values across various contexts. Among the many approaches to such education, a special role is assigned to sports and physical activity and their influence on personality development. The potential of sports to foster moral education underscores the need for effective approaches to teaching moral values through sport. The aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of active discussion and passive observation approaches in developing moral competencies among amateur and professional sports students. Material and Methods. The study included 259 first-year sports students. Among them, 131 were professional athletes. In the pre-test phase, all participants completed Lind’s Moral Judgment Test and the Moral Judgment Test in Physical Education. After a seven-week intervention, participants completed only the Moral Judgment Test in Physical Education as a post-test. The intervention involved three groups. Groups E1 and E2 viewed films that portrayed contrasting behaviors in sports. Group E3 participated in discussions based on the Konstanz Method of Dilemma-Discussion. Results. Significant differences (p = .01) in sport-related moral competence were observed in the post-test. Group E3, which participated in moral dilemma discussions, achieved the highest scores in sport-related moral competence. Among amateur athletes, the intervention significantly improved sport-related moral competencies from pre- to post-test. Conclusion. The results show that engaging in discussions about moral dilemmas can shape young athletes' perceptions and judgments. Viewing positive portrayals of sporting behavior in films also influences their understanding of moral issues in real-life sports situations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Short-term intensive interventions are particularly relevant, but the effectiveness of plyometric exercises in jointly improving aerobic and anaerobic performance remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of plyometric-based training, in the form of interval workouts during physical education lessons, on power and endurance in adolescents. A total of 87 boys and 95 girls (aged 14–15 years) participated in an 8-week intervention, performing plyometric exercises twice weekly during physical education classes. The analyzed parameters were jump height (JH) measured by countermovement jump (CMJ) and distance covered during multistage fitness test (MFT). The results showed significant improvements among boys participating in the JH experiment and the distance covered in the MFT (p < 0.05); thus, the effect sizes were relatively small (ES < 0.3). Also, the prevalence of positive responders was more common for boys than girls; however, the difference was statistically insignificant (p = 0.09). These findings suggest that plyometric training has the potential for improving physical fitness, even in the context of developing opposing physical abilities, particularly in boys. However, the effects varied across individuals and were generally small, highlighting the need to optimize the intervention to achieve more pronounced results tailored to individual characteristics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This study aimed to assess the kinematics and determine the coordination of the movements of most body segments during the execution of two types of serves (short and long) in table tennis, as well as to indicate the main differences between these serves when performed by high-level athletes. Methods: The study involved 15 male table tennis players. Each participant performed two tasks, performing short and long forehand serves with back-sidespin rotation, with up to 10 hits in the designated field for each type. The players’ movements were registered using an IMU system. Results and Conclusion: The research allowed for the development of a model for executing two types of serves in table tennis. The differences between short and long serves were mainly in the ranges of movement and angular velocities (higher for long serves). These were found in the shoulder rotation, elbow joint and wrist joint (primarily the flexion–extension movement), hand supination, and movement in the elbow joint, which also played an important role. Coaches and players should seriously consider these joints and movements in the training process. In the coordinated movement of the performed serves, a phenomenon of movement variability was observed, manifested by a large variability in execution and a low variability in the maximum speeds of the hand with the racket."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Executive functions, which includes processes such as attentional control and cognitive flexibility, are crucial for soldiers, especially in situations requiring rapid decision-making. Parachute jumping, as an intense stressor, mobilizes cognitive resources, which can lead to short-term improvements in executive functions. Methods: A total of 64 cadets divided into control (N = 32) and experimental (N = 32) groups participated in the study. The experimental group performed a parachute jump and then took the Color Trails Test, assessed both before and after the jump. Results: The results showed significant improvements in executive functions, in particular, sustained and alternating attention, sequential information processing, and monitoring one’s own behavior, suggesting a positive effect of stress on selected executive functions. Conclusions: The results indicate that intense, short-term stress can positively affect executive functions, although this effect may depend on the type of task and the participants’ experience of exposure to intense stressful stimuli. The study makes an important contribution to the design of future military training, considering the importance of mobilizing cognitive resources in response to short-term stress."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"6152e0b72467f02da4b041cf","name":"Department of Physical Education and Sport, General Tadeusz Kosciuszko Military University of Land Forces","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709299878c28a047398bdf","5e70934d878c28a0473a6e01","5ebee364752340254fc44097"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The input contains three sources of information: text from questionnaires, videos, and face images acquired using mobile applications. We collected a dataset of 86 patients. Because of the relatively small dataset, we used binary classification in this research. We applied three classic machine learning models: Regularized Logistic Regression (RLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). We designed several features acquired from video and images and selected some using different selection methods. In the experimental study, we assessed which source of information is the most discriminative for this classification. We achieved the highest F1 measure (macro) using textual data. Classification results based on dynamic features from video achieved 0.643 F1 measure (macro). Features from static images represent the worst predictive value, and the best result is 0.5694. This result does not support our hypothesis that facial asymmetry is essential in diagnosing masticatory disorders. However, the identified asymmetry is the basis for further tests to correct posture problems and additional tests by a physiotherapist, which underscores the practical implications of our research on the patient’s treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This study was aimed to analyze and synthesize the evidence on the efficacy of cognitive TR interventions in patients with neurological diseases, compared with conventional face-to-face rehabilitation. From a total of 4485 records, 9 studies met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis. At the end of the process, 7 studies remained for quantitative analysis. By comparing TR with face-to-face treatments for cognitive impairments, we assessed improvements in global cognitive domain (Mini Mental State Exam) (MD = −0.86; 95% CI −2.43, 0.72, I2 = 0%), in learning and memory domains (SMD = 0.26, 95% CI −0.22, 0.74, I2 = 24%), in verbal fluency (SMD = 0.08, 95% CI −0.47, 0.62, I2 = 0%), and in executive functions (i.e., problem-solving, central processing speed and working memory) (SMD = 0.38, 95% CI 0.06, 0.71, I2 = 0%). In all the included studies, improvement in the performance of the TR groups was comparable to that achieved through face-to-face intervention.

While participation in aquatic physical activity can help reduce these public health challenges, it is crucial to equip young people with key water skills through a well-designed aquatic curriculum to protect them from drowning and engage them in the long term in aquatic physical activities. This study reports on the development of a tool to analyse aquatic curricula for 6-to-12year-olds in Europe, addressing both aquatic health issues. Methods: Using a three-round Delphi method, 101 participants from eight European countries - including experts in teaching, organising and researching aquatic education - were asked to rate the relevance of criteria conceptualised through Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model. Results: 115 criteria were retained and grouped into eight categories: (1) curriculum management, (2) drowning epidemiology, (3) timetable, (4) location and equipment, (5) staff, (6) content, (7) assessment and (8) learners. The strong consensus on most of the criteria suggests that promoting physical activity and water safety are compatible goals. Conclusion: A well-designed aquatic curriculum, rooted in each level of the ecological model and organised through a multisystemic approach, can successfully achieve both objectives. The findings provide valuable insights for the design of aquatic safety promotion policies, as well as guidance for educators and policy makers to improve teaching strategies to increase physical activity while preventing drowning accidents."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Ninety male and female sedentary overweight and obese volunteers (19.8 ± 1.5 years; 27.9 ± 1.8 m/kg2) participated in this experimental parallel controlled design study and were examined on three occasions. Within-group analysis revealed that SCG and BCG significantly (p < 0.05) improved the performances after 8 weeks in the multistage fitness test (MFT) (23.3 and 19.6%, respectively), HG in right (1.6% and 2.9%) and left hands (1.3 and 1.7%), SLJ (5.8 and 1.4%) and VJT (27.4% and 33.9%). Between-group analysis revealed significantly greater post-intervention improvements in SCG (p < 0.001) and BCG (p = 0.043) than ICG in MFT. Improvements in SLJ were greater in SCG (p < 0.001) and BCG (p < 0.001) than ICG, being also better in SCG in comparison to SECG (p = 0.033). VJ performance was significantly better in SCG (p < 0.001), BCG (p < 0.001) and SECG (p = 0.002) than ICG. Only the improvements in HG right (p = 0.042), and SLJ (p = 0.016) showed interactions with sex. This study showed that both SCG and BCG are effective interventions for enhancing health related physical fitness, specifically in terms of aerobic capacity and strength. Similar benefits in aerobic capacity could be attained through an 8-week self-regulated activity programme, engaging in activity 3 days per week following a supportive lecture on lifestyle change. Considering sex differences, men demonstrated greater improvements in strength and jumping variables when participating in recreational soccer and basketball. On the other hand, women exhibited more significant enhancements in self-selected activities compared to men, particularly in terms of aerobic capacity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The Alpha generation is characterised by widespread access to technology from an early age. Technological proficiency is both their strength and weakness in functioning in society. The overload on the nervous system of the Alpha generation refers to the over-processing of information, which affects their verification of valuable content. Therefore, the aim of this article is The Alpha Generation Theoretical Model of Developmental Disorders.\nMaterial and Methods: This qualitative study uses the method of source material analysis and subjective verification of facts. This provides an in-depth understanding of the problem analysed by referring to an assumed theoretical model encapsulating reality into new knowledge. The results obtained on this basis provide a starting point for further research.\nResults: Developmental risks for the Alpha generation were identified as referring to their behaviour, mental and somatic health. Behavioural problems refer to their attention problems and their imitation of violent acts available online and on TV channels. Then, mental problems refer to internet addiction syndrome and anxiety-related disorders. Finally, somatic problems refer to low physical fitness, obesity and postural defects. \nConclusions: The described developmental disorders of today’s youngest generation can be put into the theoretical model of developmental disorders of the Alpha generation. It assumes the occurrence of developmental disorders simultaneously in the behavioural, mental and somatic spheres, as possible consequences of inappropriate use of technology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

A cohort of 30 city bike riders underwent a comprehensive fitting procedure, where one position was individually established based on a comfort perception questionnaire and adjusted by a bike fitter. The aim was to compare the EMG activity of muscles involved in propulsion and lumbar spine stabilisation across different positions. The Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) method was also used to analyse muscle activity throughout the pedalling cycle. The results revealed that the customised position significantly reduced EMG activity in muscles, particularly during key pedalling phases, significantly improving rider comfort and muscle efficiency. SPM analysis highlighted decreased strain in the vastus lateralis and tibialis anterior, indicating improved muscular efficiency and enhanced comfort for urban cyclists. This underscores the importance of personalised bike fitting in promoting comfort and reducing the risk of injury, suggesting that EMG analysis is a valuable tool in both clinical and recreational bike-fitting practices. Future research should explore the long-term effects and potential applications of the proposed fitting method for other bicycle geometries whenever comfort and lower back stability are priorities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Match performance data were analyzed from a total of 64 games, which included a total of 32 national teams. The variables collected from the post-match summary reports were calculated according to match time (i.e., data per minute) and were categorized in four groups: key statistics, in possession and out of possession variables, out of possession defensive pressure variables, and physical performance variables. When it comes to match outcome, significant differences were observed in key statistics (e.g., there were significantly greater possession, goals, attempts at goal on target, total passes, total passes completed, defensive line breaks, and receptions in the final third when winning compared to drawing or losing), in possession variables(e.g., winsshowed significantly greater build up unopposed compared to losses and draws), out of possession variables (e.g., wins showed significantly greater high press than losses), and out of possession defensive pressure variables (e.g., losses showed significantly greater total pressure, pressing direction outside, and ball recovery time compared to wins or draws). There were no significant differences in any physical performance variable, except for distance covered in zone 1 (losses > draws). When it comes to the phase of the tournament, no significant differences were observed in any variable, except for distance covered in zone 1 (knock-out > groups). Furthermore, significant interactions were observed between match outcome and phase of the tournament in the following variables: attempts at goal on target, pass completion %, progressions, and average pressure duration. Quantifying and comprehending match-play characteristics hold significant importance in guiding practices within women’s soccer. Therefore, this study serves as a resource for the staff of national teams to understand performance according to match outcome and phase of the tournament in an international women’s soccer tournament."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

study was to assess the changes in urinary oxytocin (OT) concentration during the period between five days before, and on the day of match, among rugby and handball players. Nine male rugby players with a mean age of 27.62 years (SD = 4.21) and 18 male handball players with a mean age of 17.03 years (SD = 0.57) participated. Urinary oxytocin level was measured by ELISA immunoassay as a ratio to the concentration of creatinine [mg/ml] measured through colorimetric detection. The relative level of OT to creatinine (OT/CRE) significantly differed between the type of player (rugby or handball) but not between times of measurements. Significant differences were only between OT/CRE level in a day of match in rugby players and in 5 days before match in handball players (p<0.05). There was no change in oxytocin levels during the time periods between five days before and on the day of a match, in either of the two kinds of players. The change in oxytocin might be traceable during the match but not before a match and this perhaps depends on a more subtle context of competition, but not on the assumption of competition. Further studies are needed based on more homogenous group with higher number of matches"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dead","uid":"byot1zGR6DaDBaUruYE9Eyg","uuid":"264294d6-d6d7-4b7e-93b6-8f267f0a455e","name":"Instytut Immunologii i Terapii Doświadczalnej im.

Integrating core academic subjects into PE classes may provide numerous benefits in both cognitive and physical developments. Therefore, combining cognitive learnings of other core subjects with physical activities may increase students’ academic learning time while improving physical abilities and skills in PE classes. EDUball/BRAINball is an interdisciplinary concept that uses balls with letters and numbers to merge physical activities with various school subjects such as mathematics and languages, especially for students up to 12 years old. The pedagogical approach has been developed for over twenty years, and students who participated in it showed significant improvements in literacy, numeracy, and physical performance. Given its potential, the EDUball/BRAINball approach offers a great didactic and pedagogical alternative for teaching fundamental subjects within PE classes.

The objective of this study was to determine whether there is an association between the expression level of four selected microRNAs and body composition over time among young female volleyball players. Blood samples and body composition measurements were taken from 7 females who are Polish volleyball players before and after 5 matches played out between the years 2017 and 2018. The blood spots were used to assess the expression of four microRNAs: miR-320, miR-182, miR-223, and miR-486. Fat mass, PFB% and BMI were positively correlated with expression level (exp.l) of miR-182. The miR-320 the exp.l was positively correlated with muscle mass and TBW. There were inverse correlations between miR-486 exp.l and PBF%, as well as between miR-486 exp.l and body mass, muscle mass, TBW, FFM, and BMR. Conversely, there were positive correlations between miR-486 exp.l and body mass and fat mass. The miR-182 may be positively correlated with fat tissue, miR-320 was positively correlated with muscle mass, and miR-486 was negatively correlated with fat mass. Overall, our study shows that the expression of miR-182, miR-320, and miR-486 is associated with body composition. The results of our study also suggest that exercise may decrease the level of miR-486."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The primary aim is to evaluate whether this method provides an objective and diagnostic tool for assessing monofin swimming techniques. Three elite monofin swimmers were evaluated under a progressive fatigue test. Results indicated that the stroke rate increases velocity by 0.95, 0.23, and 0.96 units (for the estimated models respectively). Optimized stroke length (0.01–0.12 units) also significantly correlates with velocity improvements. Joint amplitude reductions, particularly at the hip and ankle, enhanced propulsion by minimizing drag. This study highlights the Least Squares Method as a diagnostic tool for optimizing swimming techniques, with potential applications in performance training."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The present study aimed to analyze the relationships between testosterone and cortisol with anthropometric characteristics in a professional male soccer team after the pre-season period. Fourteen volunteer professional male soccer players participated in this study. Significant decreases in anthropometric characteristics were found. For biochemical measures, cortisol (13) =-5.25, p=.001, d=-.27), testosterone (t (13) =-8.10, p=.001, d=-.65) and C/T ratio (t (13) =-4.07, p=.001, d =-0.2) significantly increased after the pre-season period. Moreover, moderate negative relationships were observed between the percentage of change in body weight, r=0.61, p=.01, body fat percentage, r=.53, p=.04, and testosterone. The present study revealed that the improvements in body composition after intense training in the pre-season period could stimulate anabolic activities such as increases in muscle mass, which is an important result in terms of quality of performance and prevention of injury risk, especially throughout the competitive soccer season.

MYO recordings during muscle contraction in healthy subjects showed an active muscle stiffness influence on MYO parameters, suggesting its potential impact on CAI-related MYO findings. However, it remains unknown whether PL stiffening observed recently in CAI athletes at rest can also be detected while PL muscle contraction. This study, using myotonometry, examines the PL mechanical properties during a motor task mimicking PL's biomechanical function, i.e., simultaneous isometric foot pronation and plantar flexion (IFPPF) at 30 % and 100 % of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in athletes with CAI. Nineteen adult male athletes with CAI (per International Ankle Consortium criteria) and 19 control (CO) athletes without lateral ankle sprain incidents comprised the study groups. Both groups had similar anthropometric parameters and training volume. Simultaneous force and MYO measurements were performed at 30 % and 100 % of MVC-IFPPF, using a MyotonPRO® device. Five MYO parameters were recorded in the PL: frequency, stiffness, decrement, relaxation time, and creep. No significant inter-group differences were observed in MYO parameters and force values measured during the 30 % and 100 % of MVC-IFPPF. This study, employing myotonometry, is the first to demonstrate the lack of significant differences between CAI and CO athletes in the MYO parameters measured in the PL muscle at submaximal and maximal contraction during simultaneous IFPPF, contrasting with our previous MYO results in CAI at rest."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b5878c28a04739b2bb","5e709221878c28a04739055d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The second aim was to define the blood flow and perfusion after NHE in recreational active volunteers. Twenty-two individuals volunteered to participate in the study. This study investigated fatigue outcomes: rate of perceived exertion (RPE) scale and average force generated during NHE; mechanical properties (stiffness); morphological properties (thickness, pennation angle, and fascicle length), and vascularity index (VI) of the semitendinosus (ST) and biceps femoris long head (BFLH) at baseline, immediately post-exercise and 1-h post-exercise. The NHE fatigue procedure consisted of six bouts of five repetitions. The results showed an increase in thickness and pennation angle of BFLH and ST immediately post-exercise and a decrease in thickness and pennation angle of BFLH and ST 1-h post-exercise. While the fascicle length of BFLH and ST decreased immediately post-exercise and increased 1-h post-exercise. The VI for two muscles increased immediately post-exercise and after 1-h post-exercise. Moreover, we found a relationship between RPE and average force, that is, as RPE increased during NHE, average force decreased. In conclusion, eccentric NHE exercises significantly and acutely affect BFLH and ST. The NHE fatigue protocol significantly affected the mechanical and morphological properties of BFLH and ST muscles, changing their thickness, fascicle length, pennation angle, and VI."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Conducted on a sample of 67 boys, the participants were divided into three groups: karate, yoga, and a control group. Each group underwent physical assessments before and after the intervention, focusing on various fitness components measured by the International Physical Fitness Test (MTSF). The intervention sessions were held twice a week and included warm-up exercises, karate or yoga elements, and cool-down. The results demonstrated significant improvements (p > 0.05) in most physical fitness parameters among the karate and yoga groups in trials: run 50 m, jump, run, endurance, hanging, run, agility, sit-ups, and forward bend. However, there was no significant improvement in hand strength, indicating that the intervention might not have adequately targeted this aspect of fitness. The overall MTSF values changed as follows. For the karate group, the results improved significantly, with the mean increasing by 6.95 ± 0.71. In the yoga group, the results also improved significantly, with the mean increasing by 8.74, while the standard deviation changed by −0.19. In contrast, the control group, which did not participate in additional activities, showed a decline in performance in some areas, notably hand strength and jumping ability. Total MTSF value decreased by −1.05, and the standard deviation changed by 0.71. The findings suggest that both karate and yoga can effectively enhance children’s physical fitness, bringing their performance closer to age-adjusted norms. The study highlights the value of structured physical activity programs in promoting the physical development of children. Although no significant differences were observed between the karate and yoga groups, both interventions contributed similarly to overall fitness improvements.

Eight male members of the university swimming team, aged 19–25, performed three different warm-up protocols: 1) standardized warm-up in water (WUCON); 2) hypercapnic warm-up in water (WUARDS); 3) hypercapnic a 20-minute transition phase on land, between warm-up in water and swimming test (RE-WUARDS). The three warm-up protocols were implemented in random order every 7th day. After each protocol, the 50 m time trial front crawl swimming (swimming test) was performed. The fastest time trial swimming of 50 m front crawl was achieved after the hypercapnic transition phase (RE-WUARDS) protocol and was 27.5 ± 1.6 seconds, 1.2% faster than hypercapnic warm-up protocol (p = 0.01). This result was confirmed by a higher swimming average speed of the exercise test after RE-WUARDS compared to WUARDS (p = 0.01). The use of ARDS provoked a state of tolerable hypercapnia (obtaining carbon dioxide concentration in arterialized blood pCO2 > 45 mmHg) achieving a post-warm-up of WUARDS value 49.7 ± 5.9 mmHg (compared to the control condition which was a statistically significant difference p = 0.02) and before time trial RE-WUARDS 45.7 ± 2.1 mmHg (p = 0.01 compared to WUCON). After breathing through the 1200 ml ARDS mask during the 20-minute re-warm-up phase, there was a trend of faster time trial among participants compared to the control condition, and statistically significantly faster times compared to WUARDS, indicating that further study is appropriate to verify the efficacy of the proposed method to improve swimming efficiency."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Mature women are increasingly turning to fitness clubs to improve their physique and protect themselves from diseases and the progressive aging process. The multitude of training systems proposed to women by fitness clubs leads to the search for solutions that will bring positive health results. The response to an exercise stimulus may depend on the menopausal status.\nMethods: This quasi-experimental study aimed to determine the effects of 6, 12, and 18 weeks of circuit hydraulic weight interval training (CHWIT) on anthropometric indices, body composition estimated by the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and muscle performance in inactive pre- and post-menopausal women from an urban population. A total of 100 women aged between 35 and 69 (mean 51.5 ± 9.61) years with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 27.3 (±5.4 kg/m2) were divided by menopausal status and assigned to the training CHWIT group (25 pre- and 25 postmenopausal women) and the control group (25 pre- and 25 postmenopausal women). Each participant from the CHWIT group took part in a total of 54 training sessions, developed for the Mrs.Sporty network, under the constant supervision of a qualified trainer.\nResults: After 18 weeks of training in both intervention groups, ANCOVA demonstrated statistically significant (p < 0.05) decreased body fat (%), reduced thigh and arm circumference, and increased muscle component (kg) as the main part of fat-free body mass. Additionally, premenopausal women decreased their body mass, BMI, and waist and hip circumferences. A significant increase in the muscle component was noticed after 6 weeks of CHWIT in pre-menopausal women and only after 18 weeks in postmenopausal women. Significant progression of resistance (amount of repetitions on hydraulic machines) was observed after 6 weeks and at each subsequent stage of CHWIT in both intervention groups (p < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the controls.\nConclusion: CHWIT is an effective form of training, improving body composition and physical functions in inactive pre- and postmenopausal women. Changes in the muscle component require a longer intervention of physical effort in women after menopause."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Indeed, this has happened. Studies have shown that EDUballs promote the motor and intellectual development of children, who read faster, understand texts better, solve math tasks more effectively, learn English faster, and develop higher levels of graphomotor, spatial orientation and motor skills. The results also showed the impact of EDUballs on other social groups, including children with disabilities.\nIn 2018, a set of educational balls was developed for the English-speaking market under the name BRAINballs.\nThis book is intended for anyone who wants to use EDUballs in the education and upbringing of children, including preschool and early childhood teachers, educators working in school and community centers, therapists, educators and psychologists working with children with special educational needs, students of pedagogy, and those who work with the elderly."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare an innovative in-hospital pulmonary rehabilitation programs augmented with training elements performed in virtual reality. This randomized controlled study included 32 patients enrolled in post-COVID-19 rehabilitation at a Public Hospital in Poland. The rehabilitation models included exercise capacity training on a cycle ergometer, breathing and general fitness workout, resistance training, and relaxation. The forms of training and relaxation differed between the groups: the experimental group employed virtual reality, and the control group used a traditional form of therapy. Exercise tolerance was assessed using a 6 min walk test (6 MWT), while psychological parameters were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the brief World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BRIEF). The analysis of the post-rehabilitation results showed a statistically significant improvement in both groups regarding depression (VR: 6.9 (3.9) vs. 4.7 (3.5), p = 0.008; CG: 7.64 (4.5) vs. 6.6 (4.8), p = 0.017) and anxiety (VR: 8.6 (4.6) vs. 5.6 (3.3), p < 0.001; CG: 9.57 (6.0) vs. 8 (4.8), p = 0.003). No statistically significant improvements in quality of life were noted in both groups. Moreover, the analysis showed a statistically significant improvement in the exercise capacity in both groups after completion of the rehabilitation program, expressed as a distance in the 6 MWT, as well as a statistically significant improvement in dyspnea in the VR group. To conclude, the analysis of the preliminary data revealed that a 3-week hospital-based pulmonary rehabilitation program for COVID-19 patients led to an improvement in exercise tolerance as well as a reduction in the symptoms of anxiety and depression. The virtual reality-based form of training delivery, despite its attractiveness, did not significantly affect patients’ performance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Ten participants (mean age 23.4 y) were recruited for comparison of NCC values between the proximal and middle BFlh during maximal knee flexor eccentric contraction using an ultrasound device and isokinetic dynamometer. Using the above devices, electromyography and shear wave elastography, the effects of an 8-wk NHE program on the morphomechanical profiles, displacement and activation of the middle BFlh and eccentric torque of the knee flexor were investigated in 20 males (mean age 23.5 y).\nResults\nThe validity of UST was confirmed by comparing UST and ex vivo test results (r = 0.99). The NCC values of the middle BFlh were greater than those of the proximal BFlh. The caudal-direction displacements of the BFlh in the dominant leg were reduced after the NHE training (from 3.98 ± 3.84 to 1.50 ± 4.17 mm, p < 0.05). The magnitude of reduction was associated with improved eccentric strength of the knee flexor muscle in the dominant leg (r = 0.63).\nConclusions\nUST is a validated tool for measuring muscle displacement. NHE training decreased caudal-direction muscle displacement in the BFlh and increased eccentric strength."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

The constituents of fair play are, first of all, responsibility and justice. Both values are central values, connected with each other, and also closely connected with other values inscribed in fair play, e.g. respect, solidarity, care or honesty. The conducted analysis shows that the rules of fair play connected with formal responsibility and justice, i.e. following the rules and caring for the integrity of sport, are constituent for both sport and esports, whereas the rules of fair play connected with acting responsibly, i.e. respect and avoiding victory at all costs, are hard to realise in esports. It results from the fact that contact between the players is digitally mediated. Hence, apart from gestures and verbal communication, display of respect towards a player during a game is impeded, as is still more a spontaneous reaction to his or her being hurt. Also, avoiding winning at all costs is impeded in esports, as activities directed at obtaining victory are built into the content of the game and therefore should be carried out in accordance with the regulations, from the technical and tactical side and according to the possessed skills. However, it is possible to stop the game when the connection with the other player is suddenly interrupted. From a fair-play perspective also the content of some games employed in esports is questionable, as it assumes contesting moral rules, which in turn is at variance with the realisation of integrative, educational and formative functions of esports in society."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The study group consisted of 13 female and 14 male swimmers. First, anthropometric measures were obtained with a 3D scanner (Mephisto EX-PRO, 4D Dynamics Bvba, Belg). Subsequently, participants performed a kickstart. An instrumented starting block and four video cameras were used to collect kinematic data of the starts. The footage was analyzed using SIMI Motion software. Then Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated. Athletes of both sexes with greater body height and longer upper limbs preferred to position the back plate further from the front of the starting block (r > 0.5). The duration of the push-off phase decreased with increasing body height and lower limb length (r = 0.64; r = 0.68). Males with higher body mass and longer upper limbs covered a longer distance during the flight phase (r = 0.75; r = 0.58). In the female group, a positive correlation was shown for torso length and flight time and distance (r = 0.67; r = 0.74). Males with higher body mass had shorter total start time (r = -0.67). Conscious individual choice of the starting position can result in an improvement in the quality of the swimming start. The obtained results allow for monitoring and evaluation of the individual technique of the swimming start and thus improve the training process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Both obesity and frailty syndrome are risk factors for adverse prognosis and treatment, including high mortality. Body composition analysis with electrical bioimpedance (BIA) appears to be a good method for assessing changes in patients after various cardiovascular incidents, as well as for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Aim of the study: The aim of this study is to evaluate the qualitative composition of the body (including but not limited to phase angle (PhA), visceral fat, and lean body mass) using BIA in post-MI patients qualified for rehabilitation under the Managed Care after Acute Myocardial Infarction (MC-AMI) program. The control group consisted of patients with suspected ischemic heart disease with symptoms of angina but without myocardial infarction. Methods: The project was conducted as a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 148 patients. The final study included 94 patients after revascularization for myocardial infarction and 54 patients with stable angina admitted electively to the Cardiology Department for coronary angiography. Results: The group of patients after myocardial infarction had statistically significantly higher values of total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. The group of women after myocardial infarction had lower values for fat-free tissue mass and muscle mass in the trunk and limbs. No significant differences in PhA values were observed between the two groups. Conclusions: Learning more about the role of electrical bioimpedance brings much hope as a non-invasive method that can be used as a predictive marker of health change in cardiology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The data were collected from 1983 to 2019 using the review of scientific literature. Over the 35 years of the study, 37 top-level competitions with 283 finalists-competitors were included. The analysis of the 400 m hurdle covered mainly spatial and temporal factors of the run, related to those technical skills, the level of motor skills, and somatic structure. In addition to the basic statistics, the ANOVA analysis of variance, regression analysis, Pearson correlation, the principal component analysis (PCA), and Kaiser’s criterion was used for the multivariate analysis. The final result in the 400 mH run is determined not by the simple sum of the individual temporal and/or spatial characteristics of the run (the number of steps, the type of attacking leg, but their interaction in the area of functional asymmetry. The decisive factor in the 400 mH run strategy is the second curve, where the emphasis is on the optimal setting of the stride pattern in the context of minimizing the loss of running speed. Additionally, the application of multidimensional statistical methods is a valuable tool that allows to significantly deepen the interpretation of the obtained results, and thus optimize a strategy for a 400 mH run."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709229878c28a047390e77"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Methods: This study recruited male adult elite judo players with a mean age 26.5 of (SD = ± 8.916), a minimum black belt ranking, and no injuries in the past six months. Participants were selected from the Aris Judo Club, Thessaloniki, Greece, ensuring high-level technique for safe and reliable outcomes. Informed consent was obtained. A Huawei 5T with a 48-megapixel camera was used to record the throws. Kinovea (version 0.8.15) software was used for two-dimensional motion analysis of shoulder displacement during throws and IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25.0, Armonk, NY, USA) with Microsoft Excel were used for the statistical analysis of the data. Results: The peak acceleration of uke’s shoulder during STG was lower than in the case of TG, but the statistical test did not confirm this difference (p = 0.1). The mean peak negative velocity of uke’s shoulder in TG was higher compared to STG, and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.04). The test–retest reliability of STG throws was good (ICC = 0.74), and for TG throws, it was moderate (ICC = 0.60). The effect size was large for negative velocity in TG (d Cohen = 1.12) and moderate for acceleration in STG (d Cohen = 0.43). The individual test did not show a statistically significant difference between STG and TG (p = 0.2). Conclusions: A statistically significant difference in peak negative velocity in TG compared to STG would reveal that uke is thrown quicker by tori. Further research on impact forces to determine the effective mass of uke’s shoulder is advised."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Therefore, we compared three different recovery modalities (active cycling recovery, pneumatic compression boots, and isocapnic breathing protocol) in the context of perceived subjective pain and recovery variables, multiple biochemical and biomechanical indices, CMJ height and power, as well as repeated efforts on the ice track. Methods: Fifteen elite short-track speed skaters (eight males and seven females; age 18.3 ± 1.0 years, height 175.6 ± 7.5 cm, weight 73.7 ± 7.7 kg, 23.8 kg/m2, VO2max 55.5 mL·kg−1·min−1: ♂ 58 20 ± 3.6 mL·kg−1·min−1; and ♀ 53 ± 4.5 mL·kg−1·min−1) completed the study experiment and were included in the analyses. Repeated measures ANOVA with optional post hoc Bonferroni correction was used to assess the association magnitude of changes in variables across the recovery methods. Results: All the investigated protocols were associated with significant changes in multiple recovery indices observed within all the investigated protocols (p ≤ 0.05). However, for this sample, they resulted in analogous effects on subjective variables, hormonal response, creatine kinase, CMJ parameters, and on-ice performance (between-protocol effect: p ≥ 0.002). Changes in creatine kinase were generally higher in males than females (p = 0.05), which might suggest that optimal recovery protocols in short-track are gender-dependent.

The aim of the study was to assess the association of individual and combined single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the rs6265 BDNF (Val66Met), rs397595 DAT (SLC6A3), and rs4680 COMT (Val158Met) genes with early‑onset of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Moreover, we assessed the association between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and the level of BDNF protein in the serum of patients with PD and controls. The study involved 163 patients with idiopathic PD divided into early onset (<55 years) and late‑onset (>55 years) groups and 91 healthy age‑matched people (Control). The SNP were determined using the TaqMan Real‑Time PCR method. Serum BDNF levels were determined by ELISA assay. The risk of developing early PD in people with the BDNF genotype AG increases threefold in comparison with the carriers of the BDNF genotype GG. In PD patients and healthy people with the BDNF genotypes AG and AA, a lower serum BDNF level was found compared to those with the BDNF genotype GG in both groups. The results of our study indicate that the presence of the Val66Met BDNF gene polymorphism is associated with reduced blood BDNF levels and an elevated risk of developing early‑onset PD. This effect appears to be more pronounced in men."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"608135d42467f0276870e0c9","name":"Instytut Nauk o Sporcie, Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im. J.

This study aims to explore how different demographics perceive success in martial arts.\n\nApproach and purpose: The research questions focused on identifying correlations between perceptions of success and demographic factors: (1) sex, (2) age, (3) type of martial art practiced, and (4) nationality. These factors were examined to understand their impact on success perceptions among martial arts practitioners.\n\nMaterials and methods: The study utilized the Perception of Success Questionnaire (POSQ) to gather data from 268 participants—142 from Poland and 126 from Ukraine—selected through voluntary participation. Statistical analyses included standard deviation, coefficient of variability, Spearman’s rank correlation, and ANOVA for multifactor analysis.\n\nResults: The study revealed a weak correlation between the type of martial art practiced and perception of success (rs = 0.38), indicating that the style of martial art has limited influence on success perception. There was a weak correlation between nationality and perception of success (rs = 0.20), suggesting cultural factors do not play a role. A strong correlation was found between age and perception of success (rs = 0.80), highlighting how perceptions evolve with age. A significant correlation was also found between sex and perception of success (rs = 0.90), which may reflect broader cultural patterns influenced by globalization.\n\nConclusion: While the study identifies important demographic correlations affecting perceptions of success in martial arts, the findings are constrained by the sample size and demographic distribution, which limits the generalizability of the results. Further research with a larger and more diverse sample is recommended to deepen understanding."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Its effects are visible throughout the tourism industry, including the management system (DMOs). The study aim is to the determine the changes that have been taking place in the operation of the destination management organizations (DMOs) in Poland as a result, including the usage of existing or expected organizational support tools. The study consisted of three stages: desk research, diagnostic survey, and qualitative and statistical analyses. Empirical data from all 16 regional DMOs in Poland were collected, including the use and effectiveness of the anti-crisis assistance programs, expectations towards the support tools, actions taken to mitigate the pandemic effects, and the changes in selected marketing activities and support strategies in the pre- and post-pandemic period. The study results indicated the insufficient availability of tools supporting the organizations’ activities during a pandemic and little use by the DMOs of most of the tools offered by the anti-crisis programs, alongside a moderate assessment of their effectiveness. The need to modify anti-crisis programs and/or expand them to include other forms of assistance available to the DMOs was identified. The proposed research tool can be implemented to assess the necessary actions taken during the crisis in other types of tourism organizations in various regions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

eye tracking help assess the state of consciousness in non-verbal brain injury patients?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background/Objectives: Developments in eye-tracking technology are opening up new possibilities for diagnosing patients in a state of minimal consciousness because they can provide information on visual behavior, and the movements of the eyeballs are correlated with the patients’ level of consciousness. The purpose of this study was to provide validation of a tool, based on eye tracking by comparing the results obtained with the assessment obtained using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R). Methods: The mul-ti-center clinical trial was conducted in Poland in 2022–2023. The results of 46 patients who were not able to communicate verbally due to severe brain injury were analyzed in this study. The state of consciousness of patients was assessed using the Minimally Conscious State Detection test (MCSD), installed on an eye tracker and compared to CRS-R. The examinations consisted of performing the MCSD test on patients five times (T1–T5) within 14 days. Collected data were processed based on the FDA and GCP’s regulatory requirements. Depending on the nature of the data, the mean and standard deviation, median and lower and upper quartiles, and maximum and minimum values were calculated. Passing–Bablok regression analysis was used to assess the measurement equiva-lence of the methods used. Results: There was no difference between the MCSD and CRS-R in the raw change between T5 and T1 time points, as well as in the total % of points from all time points. The MCSD results from each time point show that at least the first two measurements serve to famil-iarize and adapt the patient to the measurement process, and the third and next measurement should be considered reliable. Conclusions: The results indicated a significant relationship be-tween the scores obtained with MCSD and CRS-R.

These systems are distinguished by divergent rules for resolving confrontations, which in turn affects the health and safety of competitors. At present, two predominant systems of sport fighting kumite exist: semi contact (as defined by the World Karate Federation (WKF)) and full contact (as defined by Karate Combat (KC)). These systems differ in their impact on the safety, health and injuries of competitors, particularly in the context of sport fighting among male competitors. The objective of this article is the author's classification of karate competitors in relation to the kumite sport fighting systems: semi contact and full contact.\n\nMaterial and Methods: The methodology employed involved the analysis of digital records of league fights in the organizations WKF for semi contact and KC for full contact from the 2024 season. In addition, the method of competent judges was used to determine the types of karate competitors based on the combat tactics analysed. Based on this, three conventional types for semi contact and three conventional types for full contact were derived. When creating this classification, we consciously depart from the strict semantic links with combat sports theory, and even more so agonology (science about struggle)\n\nResults: Semi-contact karate competitors: of the first type (SC1)  fight ‘technically’ (fighting based on innovative, non-standard actions without clear offensive or defensive preferences), of the second type (SC2) fight ‘defensively’ clear defensive preferences), of the third type (SC3) fight in a ‘mixed manner’ – technically and defensively. In the context of karate competitors engaging in full contact, the classification system encompasses three distinct types: FC1, characterized by combative fighting (demonstrating superiority without the need for a knockout); FC2, marked by close combat; and FC3, aimed at achieving knockout (extremely offensive/aggressive type).\n\nConclusions: Since scientific knowledge about struggle is not widespread among combat sports practitioners (not only karate), this classification can be an inspiration for deeper reflection on the sense of improving oneself through hand-to-hand combat training."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) has categorized supplements based on scientific evidence regarding their efficacy and safety. Despite extensive global research on dietary supplement use among athletes, data on Polish athletes remain limited. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate supplement use among Polish athletes, considering their competitive level and gender. Additionally, it assessed whether athletes select supplements in accordance with the AIS classification and examined their awareness of supplement certification programs.\nMethods\n\nThis cross-sectional study included 659 Polish athletes (309 women, 350 men) from various sports, representing both professional (57.7%) and nonprofessional (42.3%) levels. An online questionnaire was used to assess dietary supplement consumption, sources of information regarding supplementation, and knowledge of anti-doping and supplement certification programs. Supplement use was categorized according to the AIS classification (Groups A – D). Statistical analyses, including chi-square tests and Mann – Whitney U tests, were conducted to evaluate differences between professional and nonprofessional athletes, as well as between male and female participants.\nResults\n\nA high prevalence of dietary supplement use (91.1%) was observed among Polish athletes, with no significant differences between professional (95.8%) and nonprofessional (94.3%) athletes or between men (92.0%) and women (90.0%). The most frequently consumed supplements were sports drinks (63.9%), electrolyte supplements (51.6%), and isolated protein supplements (54.6%), vitamin D (71.6%), vitamin C (59.8%), with significantly higher intake among professional athletes. Male athletes were more likely than females to consume caffeine (p < 0.001), creatine (p < 0.001), and β-alanine (p < 0.001). Melatonin use was significantly higher among professionals (p < 0.05). Awareness of WADA regulations was moderate (72.7%), but knowledge of supplement certification programs was low, with only 18.2% of professional athletes familiar with Informed Sport, and 10.7% with the Cologne List. Social media was the most common source of supplement information (41.9%), while only 17.6% of athletes consulted qualified specialists in sports nutrition and supplementation area."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Participants were divided into two groups, undergoing either 8-day or 28-day training. Significant improvements were observed in reaction time (RT) and eye–hand coordination (EHC) for both groups. Notably, cognitive gains in EHC were maintained over time, indicating the durability of training effects. The lack of significant differences between the short-term and long-term training outcomes suggests that even brief, intensive VR training can lead to substantial cognitive improvements, potentially obviating the need for extended training periods. The findings underscore the potential of immersive VR games like Beat Saber as effective tools for cognitive training. This study also highlights the relevance of VR technology beyond entertainment, demonstrating its application in cognitive enhancement. Given the rising popularity of esports and VR, integrating such technologies into cognitive training programs offers a promising avenue for improving cognitive functions in younger populations familiar with virtual environments. The results suggest that VR-based interventions can enhance cognitive functions which are crucial for both competitive esports and general cognitive functioning, making VR a versatile tool in various training contexts. Further research is recommended to explore the generalizability of these findings to other VR games and different populations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Methods: This study comprised 32 athletes training in middle-distance running at a high sports level. The subjects were divided into groups depending on the applied breathing training (IMT): group IMT on the PowerBreath, group IMT on the Threshold, and the control group labeled sham-IMT. The following tests were performed on each athlete: spirometry, maximal inspiratory pressure, expiratory pressure, and physical performance. Results: A significant increase in the levels of the parameters VO2/kg, PEF, PImax, and PEmax, as well as a decrease in lactic acid levels and an increase in lactate threshold in both sexes, were observed as a result of the training on the PowerBreathe device. There were no significant differences in the levels of the parameters VO2/kg, PEF, PImax, lactic acid, and lactate threshold in either sex after Threshold training. A significant increase in PEmax was found in the Threshold device training group. Conclusions: Most of the assessed parameters of physical fitness and lung ventilation function, along with the respiratory muscle strength of women and men running middle distances, increased significantly after the use of IMT on PowerBreathe, and these results were maintained in the third stud, in contrast to the use of IMT on Threshold, with which there was no significant improvement."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The study included eight male advanced-level (polish national team) table tennis players (aged 22.7 ± 2.7 years). All of them were right-handed and presented an offensive style of play. Participants performed one task: performing a series of topspin strokes. Kinematic parameters were measured using the MR3 myoMuscle Master Edition system. The movement of the playing hand was used to assess specific cycle events. Angular values and velocities of the body segments and maximal linear velocities of the playing hand were calculated. The basic statistics were applied. Quartile coefficients of variation were used to assess the interindividual variability. The research made it possible to determine the kinematics of the strokes used in the combination of plays in table tennis. The essential elements of coordination of movements during the combination of three topspin strokes were indicated. Players make strokes during a series of plays at high frequency and velocity (up to several hundred degrees/s at some joints), reducing the ranges of motion in specific body segments, which were observed to be smaller (even up to several dozen degrees) than the analogous ranges reported in the literature for single strokes. This seems to be a significant note to players and coaches in table tennis. In addition, the players execute the stroke slightly differently than in single strokes, which is caused by the need to combine the striking movement with footwork and quickly position themselves for subsequent hits. The players also used different, variable execution patterns (different angles – settings in the joints), although the effect – in the form of the maximum velocity of the playing hand – was very similar. This can be considered a manifestation of a phenomenon called “functional movement variability,” which means that athletes adjust their movements using different movement patterns but achieve similar results regarding maximum linear hand speed. This highlights the importance of the individualisation process in table tennis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Back-carrying of children is common among South Africans and becoming popular among Westerners. Establishing the potential effects of back-carrying on lower-limb development and gait is therefore important.\nResearch question\nDoes BC influence the tri-planar instantaneous lower-limb kinematics and temporospatial parameters of the full gait cycle in children, and is there an association between static tibial torsion and the lower-limb gait kinematics?\nMethods\nTwelve NBC (age = 8.00 ± 0.95 years) and 12 BC (age = 8.08 ± 0.79 years) children were selected. Tri-planar kinematics of the hip, knee, and ankle were captured during gait using an eight-camera motion analysis system and Visual3D software to extract the kinematic data. All static tibial torsion were measured goniometrically. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to compare joint kinematics during the gait cycle and the association of tibial torsion throughout the gait cycle.\nResults\nSPM revealed significant differences between BC and NBC participants in hip kinematics (mean difference = 2.49°, p = 0.016) at 52–66 % of the gait cycle and knee joint kinematics (mean difference = 3.00°, p = 0.026) at 34–41 % of the gait cycle. Temporospatial differences were non-significant for speed, stride length, stance time, and stride width (p = 0.80, gHedges = 0.10). Significant correlations were evident between static tibial torsion and joint kinematics for the knee (r = -0.44 to −0.69, p = 0.041) for BC children and for the ankle (r = 0.74–0.75, p = 0.025) in NBC children. Larger internal tibial torsion is associated with more in-toeing and internal knee rotation during the swing phase in back-carried children."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Heart rate variability after sprint interval training in cyclists and implications for assessing physical fatigue. J Strength Cond Res 36(2): 558–564, 2022—This study evaluated the time- and frequency-domain indexes of heart rate variability (HRV) during sprint interval exercise test (SIXT) and identify the onset of fatigue by HRV concurrent with changes in average (Pavg) and peak (Ppeak) power output, total oxygen uptake (V̇o2tou), and blood hydrogen (H+) and lactate (La−) concentrations. Twenty-seven cyclists performed 4 sets of SIXT in which each set consisted of four 30-second maximal sprints interspersed with 90 seconds of low-intensity cycling. Each set was separated by 25–40 minutes of recovery. Before beginning each set, HRV was analyzed by time (mean normal-to-normal RR intervals [RRNN], SD of normal-to-normal RR intervals [SDNN], and square root of the mean squared difference between successive normal-to-normal RR intervals [RMSSD]) and frequency (total spectral power [T] and very low- [VLF], low- [LF], and high-frequency [HF] spectral power) domain methods. Pavg, Ppeak, and V̇o2tou were recorded in each set, and H+ and La− were measured after each set. RRNN, SDNN, and VLF decreased in the second set, whereas all time and frequency indexes of HRV decreased in the third and fourth set. Pavg and H+ decreased, while V̇o2tou increased in the fourth set. Ppeak decreased in the second, third, and fourth set. Correlations were found between the changes in the time and frequency indexes of HRV with H+, La−, and V̇o2tou. The results indicate that HRV does not reflect the onset of physical fatigue in SIXT as was observed in Pavg and no correlation was found between the changes in HRV with Pavg and Ppeak."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The group consisted of people who trained calisthenics in Fitness Academy, Pasaż Grunwaldzki, in Wroclaw. A goniometer was used to measure the range of motion in the shoulder joint in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes. Furthermore, in the study group a visual analogue scale (VAS) were used for the assessment of the level of pain in shoulder joints.\nRESULTS: After the calisthenics training, an increase in the mean values of shoulder complex mobility ranges was observed in all evaluated ranges in both groups. Statistically significant differences were observed in the group of women in extension, flexion, horizontal extension, and external rotation, whereas in men, in all evaluated ranges except internal rotation of the shoulder joints.

Numerous studies confirmed the effectiveness of the HIIT for cardiorespiratory fitness development. Fewer studies examined the relationship between these factors in one dependencies model in overweight and obese adolescents. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to examine whether cardiorespiratory fitness mediated the relationship between HIIT and body fat% and whether sex moderated this relation.\nMETHODS: Thirty-six students (15 boys and 21 girls) aged 16.02±0.39 years were examined. Participants were assigned to the HIIT intervention or control group. The intervention lasted 14 minutes during one physical education lesson per week for ten weeks. Harvard step-test results which reflected cardiorespiratory fitness and body fat% received via bioimpedance, were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Mediation analysis was conducted in the whole group because sex was not a moderator in any associations (P>0.05). HIIT intervention was associated with reducing body fat% (B=-3.63, P=0.029) and improvement of cardiorespiratory fitness (B=4.487, P<0.001). Simultaneously, body fat% was significantly mediated by changes in cardiorespiratory fitness (B=-2.21, P<0.049). Significant effect of HIIT on body fat% decreased (Bdirecttotal) and was no longer significant after including cardiorespiratory fitness (B=-1.42, P=0.431).\nCONCLUSIONS: HIIT training is an effective method of reducing body fat% and improving cardiorespiratory fitness. A higher cardiorespiratory fitness level may be conducive to increase the effectiveness of HIIT training, which translates into a more effective reduction of body fat. Due to the lack of sex moderation in the observed relationships, this effect occurs in both sexes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Methods: The study subject, a long-time Nordic walking instructor, was assigned to walk 12 m/trial (14 trials with 5 sampled gait cycles) at a velocity preferred for Nordic walking. The trials were simultaneously recorded by both systems. The instantaneous lower (ankle, knee, hip) and upper (shoulder, elbow, wrist) limb joint angles were recorded. Results: The joint angles from MyoMotion were significantly larger or smaller (depending on the joint and plane) than those from BTS.

Univariate differences in RP were analyzed using ANOVA and the t-test for dependent samples and multivariate differences were identified using canonical discriminant analysis.\nRESULTS: The main findings were that all positions achieved significantly higher average speeds and walking distances in the first half of the match than in the second half. Furthermore, analysis of positions showed that CM covered more distance than CD in all 5-minute intervals. In addition, WM performed more high-intensity running than CD in all 5-minute intervals and FW performed more high-intensity running than all other playing positions.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings from the present study should help coaches design training exercises that are specific to parts of a match. Moreover, the findings can help provide better understanding of match demands and individualization of training. Analysis of 5-minute intervals may also help coaches understand the stages of a match where player substitutions will be most effective."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Sport, properly conducted in the educational process, can positively influence the moral and biological/physical development of human beings, mobilizing them to physical activity appropriate to the discipline. This important element is basically missing in e-sports. Moreover, in the process of sports training, the athlete is supported by a coach who can explain both positive and negative phenomena occurring during this process.

However, the meaning of spine curvatures in physical performance remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of spine curvatures in the sagittal plane in physical performance regarding team sports training.\nMETHODS: The study sample included 21±2.1 years old males: 19 team sport players (TSP) and 17 average physically active men (comparison group, CG). The spine curvatures in the sagittal plane were assessed using the photogrammetric method (Moire), and physical performance tests were conducted.\nRESULTS: The sacrolumbar spine position was positively related to speed abilities only in TSP. The sacrolumbar spine inclination angle (α) increase by one unit was associated with improving the time in the 20 m linear speed and agility t-test measured change of direction speed (CODs) by 0.02 s and 0.07 s, respectively. The downsized lumbar lordosis angle by a one-unit caused improvement by 0.01s in 20 m linear speed. In CG, it was revealed that a higher thoracolumbar spine inclination angle (β) was associated with a worse ability to maintain static balance. In TSP, sacrolumbar spine position is associated with speed abilities.\nCONCLUSIONS: The flattened spine curves are not conducive to linear speed and CODs. There is a need to keep proper spine curvatures to develop and maintain high physical performance. Indicated sagittal plane spine curvatures could predispose to better speed performance. Measurement of these parameters could be valuable in prediction speed and CODs abilities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Although several studies have shown the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) in the motor treatment of poststroke patients, there is a lack of studies that would also evaluate the impact of VR on psychological aspects. Thus, we investigated the effectiveness of immersive VR therapy on both functional activity and depressive symptoms in stroke survivors.\nPatients and Methods: We conducted a single blind, randomized controlled trial comparing VR therapy with Schultz’s Autogenic Training (SAT). Patients randomized to the VR group received treatment in an immersive VR therapeutic garden with elements of psychotherapy and physical activity of the upper extremities, whereas patients in the control group received SAT. Additionally, patients in both groups received standard neurological rehabilitation. The full research cycle lasted six weeks. We used Geriatric Depression Scale, Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale, Acceptance of Illness Scale, Visual Analogue Scale of pain, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Barthel Index, Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale and Rivermead Motor Assessment for outcome assessment. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03830372).\nResults: We assessed 60 patients and randomly assigned to the VR or control group. The VR group showed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (ηp2 = 0.13, p < 0.01) compared to SAT. The applied VR therapy significantly increased the sense of self-efficacy and the level of acceptance of the illness; however, this effect was similar to that obtained with the standard intervention. We did not observe statistically significant changes in the functional parameters of post-stroke patients.\nConclusion: The use of VR therapy combined with neurological rehabilitation had a positive effect on improving mood and reducing depressive symptoms in post-stroke patients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Predicting changes in maximal oxygen uptake in response to polarized training (sprint interval training, high-intensity interval training, and endurance training) in mountain bike cyclists. J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1726–1730, 2022—The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of change in maximal oxygen uptake (ΔV̇o2max) in response to a polarized training program. Twenty well-trained mountain bike cyclists completed an 8-week intervention of sprint interval training (SIT) (8–16 30-second maximal sprints), high-intensity interval training (4–6 bouts at 85–95% maximal aerobic power), and endurance training (2–3 hours cycling at 70–80% power at the ventilatory threshold). An incremental exercise test was performed to determine preintervention and postintervention maximal oxygen uptake (V̇o2max) and maximal pulmonary ventilation (VEmax) normalized to lean body mass (LBM). The frequency and time domain of heart rate variability (HRV) was also determined during recovery after moderate warm-up in the first and last SIT. Training status was quantified as the total distance cycled in the previous year. V̇o2max, VEmax, and the root mean square of the successive differences of normal-to-normal time interval between heartbeats (RMSSD), which is the time domain of HRV all increased significantly. Multiple significant correlations were observed between ΔV̇o2max and training status and baseline measures of VEmax·LBM−1, RMSSD, and V̇o2max·LBM−1 and a regression equation was developed (r = 0.87, r2 = 0.76; p = 0.0001). The change in V̇o2max in response to polarized training can be predicted with high accuracy based on several measurable variables."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Using microtechnology and the Fourier Transform for the analysis of effective activity time in professional soccer. J Strength Cond Res 37(12): 2491–2495, 2023—This study aimed to investigate the use of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) for the analysis of effective activity time in professional soccer by (a) exploring the relationship between this variable and standard external load parameters and (b) analyzing the effective activity time during official professional soccer matches. Twenty-six male players participated in the study. Each player was categorized as midfielder, central defender, full-back, wide-midfielder, or forward. Tracking systems based on inertial sensors (4 3D accelerometers, 3 3D gyroscopes, and 1 magnetometer), and global positioning systems technology were used to collect external load measures for 35 matches. Each match was analyzed considering 15-minute periods to explore the evolution of effective activity time during the matches. The extra time from each match was also included. Fast Fourier transform duration may be a representative variable of effective activity time, given the strong positive correlation with the external load variables (p < 0.001). The linear regression analysis showed that the variables that significantly contributed to the model (R2 = 0.97) were the total of steps and the distance covered. The mean effective activity time in soccer match play was ∼48.69 minutes. This time significantly changed depending on factors such as the period of the match (F = 239.05; p < 0.001; ηp2 = 0.60) or playing position (F = 16.99; p < 0.001; ηp2 = 0.06). The greatest effective activity time was observed for all playing positions in the 0′–15′ period. However, the 60′–75′ period showed the lowest effective activity times compared with the rest of the 15-minute periods for all positions except for forwards (75′–90′). From a practical standpoint, sports performance practitioners may consider these results to improve the individualization of training and match demands. Also, a more accurate indicator of exercise intensity may be obtained (e.g., multiplying the rating of perceived exertion by the effective activity time)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Hyperlordosis or hypolordosis of the lumbar spine may be one of the causes of LBP. Various exercise programs are used in the prevention of LBP, but they do not consider individualization for diagnosed hyperlordosis or hypolordosis of the lumbar spine. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the authors’ original exercise program aimed at reducing hyperlordosis or increasing hypolordosis. METHODS: Sixty women aged 26 to 40 working in a sedentary position participated in the study. The sagittal curvature and the range of motion of the lumbar spine flexion were measured with the Saunders inclinometer, and the level of LBP was evaluated using the VAS scale. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups that participated in a 3-month exercise program developed by the authors. The first group performed exercises adjusted to the diagnosed hyperlordosis or hypolordosis, and the second group performed the same exercises regardless of the lumbar lordosis angle. The study was conducted again after completing the exercises. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the groups (p< 0.0001) in the level of pain, with better results in the group where individualized exercise was used – 60% of the participants reported complete absence of LBP. The lumbar lordosis angle was within normal limits in 97% of the subjects in the first group, and in 47% of the subjects in the second group. CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirm the validity of using individualized exercises with regard to diagnosed hyperlordosis or hypolordosis of the lumbar spine in order to achieve better analgesic and postural correction effects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Adolescents aged 16 (N.=73, 42.5% of males) were identified as RsBFP (N.=45) or NRsBFP (N.=28). MF was assessed based on hand strength (HS), abdominal muscle strength (ABS), and leg power (VJ).\nMETHODS: Profile analysis showed distinct patterns of MF changes in both response categories. Despite the presence of parallelism (Wilks’ Λ=0.979, Pillai’s V=0.212, P=0.473), a gradient of increasing changes (HS-ABS-VJ) was found in the RsBFP, while a gradient of decreasing changes was shown in the NRsBFP, and a significant level of inequality (F(1,71)=7.823, P=0.047, partial eta-squared [η2p] 0.041).\nRESULTS: One-way analysis showed a significant and moderate effect on VJ (F(1,71)=7.080, P=0.010, η2P=0.091), a close to significant effect on ABS (F(1,71)=3.300, P=0.074, η2P=0.044) and lack of an effect on HS (F(1,71)=0.699, P=0.406, η2P=0.010). The test of equal means across the condition categories (separately for RsBFP and NRsBFP) indicated that there was no multivariate statistically significant within-group effect (F(2, 70)=0.517, P=0.599).\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings may help teachers assess the potential and indirect changes in muscle performance after employing a body weight intervention (based on the HIIT program).

The aim of the study was to assess the effects of smoking traditional cigarettes and alternative forms of nicotine intake on the functional state of the respiratory system of smokers and non-smokers.\nMaterial/Methods: Study participants (n=60) were divided into 3 groups: non-smokers (control group), cigarette smokers, and nicotine alternative users. Respiratory function testing (spirometry), forced oscillation technique, and measurement of respiratory muscle strength (PImax, PEmax) were performed. All of the above respiratory function tests were performed in accordance with European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society recommendations.\nResults: Smokers and those using alternative forms of nicotine intake had significantly higher values, including resistance at 5 Hz% and 11 Hz%, among others.\nConclusions: Smokers and users of alternative forms of nicotine are characterized by reduced flow through the small bronchioles, as evidenced by a reduction in maximal expiratory flow at 25% of vital capacity. Smokers and users of alternative forms of nicotine have higher resistance values at the height of small and medium bronchioles.

We used the projection moiré method to examine spinal curvatures in both positions and the MyotonPRO device to measure the tone and stiffness of muscles in 3 regions. We evaluated the effects of positions (standing vs sitting), regions (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar), and side factor (right vs left) using multivariate analysis.\n\nRESULTS: The sitting position significantly decreased the lumbosacral and thoracolumbar angles (P<0.001), but had no effect on the superior thoracic angle. Muscle tension and stiffness were the highest (P<0.001) in the cervical region and did not differ between positions (P>0.05) in this region. We found significantly higher muscle tone and stiffness in the thoracic and lumbar regions during sitting than during standing (P<0.001). There was symmetry in the muscle tone and the stiffness between the right and left sides of the spine.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The sitting posture decreased lumbosacral and thoracolumbar angles but increased muscle tension and stiffness in the lumbar and thoracic regions only.

To evaluate body posture, we assessed differences in the height of the acromion process (SSA) and differences in the height of the shoulder blades (LSAS), differences in the distance of the lower angles of the shoulder blades and spine (LSPD), differences in the height of the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS), and the maximum deflection of spinous process line from the line C7-S1 (PTA). The Injury History Questionnaire was used for injury data collection from the previous 12 months. The parameters were assessed for their ability to distinguish between injured and non-injured individuals using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method.\nRESULTS: The results suggest that LSPD is a significantly (P=0.028) better predictor of injury than other body posture parameters. The cut-off points for risk of injury based on the assessed body posture parameters demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy higher than chance, except for LSAS and PTA (AUC >0.5). In addition, there were no sex differences in the predictive potential of detecting injuries between males and females.\nCONCLUSIONS: The LSPD has the greatest predictive value for musculoskeletal injuries.

However, these positions can lead to joint stress and an increased risk of injury, as well as work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs). These disorders can significantly impact the performance of their duties, which can negatively affect patient recovery. OBJECTIVE:This study assessed and compared health behaviour and work-related musculoskeletal pain among Polish physiotherapists and nurses. METHODS:The study encompassed a group of 304 participants. The methodology consisted of a survey addressing pain-related questions and the Health Behaviour Inventory (HBI). The HBI evaluates health behaviour in four categories. RESULTS:The average HBI score was 5.05 (±1.96) points for physiotherapists and 4.50 (±1.86) points for nurses (P = .01). When analysing the HBI components, a statistically significant difference was observed in positive mental attitude and health practices (P <  .05). Regarding work-related musculoskeletal pain, 92% of nurses and 79% of physiotherapists reported experiencing pain while working (P <  .01). Pain intensity, measured with the VAS, was 3.77 (±2.37) for physiotherapists and 4.73 (SD 2.04) for nurses (P <  .01). Physiotherapists more often suffered from upper limb pain (57% vs 49%), while nurses experienced middle/lower back pain (82% vs 63%) and lower extremity pain (38% vs 23%) more frequently. CONCLUSIONS:Both professional groups experience WRMSDs, with nurses suffering more regularly and severely.

Five CMJs were performed in the following 9 minutes. Statistical significance was set at α = 0.05. A 2-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) (group-time), with baseline CMJ as a covariable, revealed statistically significant differences between groups ( p < 0.0001). The Bonferroni post hoc tests revealed higher results in the EG at the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth minutes ( p < 0.05).

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of specific plyometric exercises engaging the ankle joint, called stiff-legged hops as a con-ditioning activity (CA) on countermovement jump (CMJ) and sprinting performance evaluated over a distance of 50m in elite female and male sprinters that differ in athletics level. Material and meth-ods: Thirty-two sprinters of the Polish National Team were assigned into experimental and control (CTRL) groups, while the experimental group was further equally divided by the 50m sprint time (ELITE; S-ELITE). All participants performed pre-CA (5 min before) and post-CA (5 and 10 min after CA) CMJ and 50m sprints. The CA consists of 3 sets of 10 repetitions of stiff-legged hops, while the CTRL group did not perform any activity. Results: The stiff-legged hops had no significant effect on either CMJ or the 50 m sprint performance in both the ELITE and S-ELITE athletes. However, there was a significant increase in 20 m (p = 0.025; η2 = 0.162) and 30 m sprint time (p = 0.02; η2 = 0.172), with an increase in ground reaction time (p = 0.009; η2 = 0.211) in post-CA from pre-CA with no dif-ference between the groups. The use of stiff-legged hops as a pre-sprint CA did not provide notice-able benefits or drawbacks in CMJ and 50 m sprinting among elite sprinters. However, it may even deteriorate 20 and 30 m performed due to increased ground reaction time. Conclusion: The results of this research do not provide evidence that supports the use of such CA in training or pre-compe-tition contexts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Height, weight, and segmental body composition were determined using the Tanita MC-780 body composition analyzer. The foot structure was assessed using the Kasperczyk method, supplemented with digital analysis using the Podoscan 2D camera. The Weisflog index and gamma angle for feet were calculated. Children were divided into 2 groups: children in Group I did not have foot deformities and those in Group II had foot deformities.\n\nRESULTS: No correlation was observed between body mass and the occurrence of anomalies in foot structure. A correlation was noted between the Weisflog index for the right foot and height in both groups. The Weisflog index for both feet was correlated with BMI, with higher values obtained for the left foot in both groups.

Early, comprehensive, and continuous physiotherapy after spinal cord injury, starting from the preoperative stage, through several years improves the patient’s functional status and independence. Material and methods: The patient is a 51‑year‑old miner hospitalized in the Neurosurgical Department of 4WSKzP in Wrocław. He suffered a cervical spine injury in a mining accident. Moreover, he was found to have a type III odontoid fracture with intramedullary displacement (1.2 cm) and an atlas arch fracture without displacement. The patient’s functional status was assessed using: SCIM III, ASIA, and FIM scales.The aim of the study: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of 4 years of physiotherapy based on neurophysiological methods and its benefits for a patient after spinal cord injury at the C1 and C2 levels. Results: During the first 36 months of therapy, a marked improvement in sensation was observed, with a slight dominance on the left side until the 24th month, followed by stabilization of the values. In the third month, a consistent increase in the muscle strength of both upper extremities was noted, showing a steady linear progression. Independence in daily activities, scored according to the FIM scale, also showed improvement in parameters until the 48th month of therapy. Independence in self-care, scored according to the SCIM III scale, was at 14 points until the first year of treatment, and reached 20 points by the end of the therapy. Assessment of respiratory function and sphincter control, allows us to conclude that the greatest improvement was achieved in the first 3 months of continuous treatment, i.e. from 0 to 17 points, after 12 months; 23, after 48 months the patient scored a total of 40 points. In terms of transfers in the home environment, improvements were observed up to the 12th month of therapy. The greatest rate of change in mobility was observed during the first 2 years of treatment. At 36 and 48 months of therapy, the improvement in mobility maintained a modest increasing trend. Conclusions: A beneficial effect of 4 years of physiotherapy was observed in the functional status and independence of the patient after severe SCI. As a result, he was able to drive a passenger car independently."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Swimming is an athletic discipline that largely involves the upper limbs. Due to the driving and propulsive function, there is a heavy involvement of almost all muscles of the arm. Painful shoulder syndrome (PSS) is considered to be one of the main causes of interference with an effective and correct movement of the underwater stroke, which is a fundamental element of functionality in this discipline. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether PSS affects upper limb function in competitive swimmers. Material and methods. Thirty-two swimmers aged 17–24 years with at least 2nd sport class participated in the study. The swimmers were divided into two groups: group I – the experimental group, with subjects reporting pain in the shoulder area, and group II – the control group (sub-jects without pain in the shoulder area). Isokinetic tests at 60°/s, 180°/s, and 300°/s, hand grip strength tests, and upper limb power measurements on a swim ergometer were performed. The standard visual analogue pain scale (VAS) was used to assess the severity of pain. Results. There were significant relationships between hand grip and pulling force. Hand grip also strongly correlated with peak torque in all considered limb movements. The other examined parameters did not show statistical significance. Conclusions. Despite the significant results of the study component, there was no significant influence of painful shoulder syndrome on performance levels."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

No difference were observed in the goal scoring time in two World Cups in terms of the different intervals, results, areas, and ways (P>0.05), but more open play goals were scored in the 2022 event (χ2=10.200, P<0.05) and substitutes scored more goals in the 2022 World Cup group stage as compared to those in the 2018 event (χ2=5.161, P<0.05). Despite more stoppage time in the 2022 event than in the 2018 event (11.6 vs. 7.3 min), no differences were observed in the number of goals scored in stoppage time (χ2=0.953, P>0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of the insight of goal scoring pattern. Practitioners need to allocate physical fitness to tactical arrangements in a reasonable manner according to the time of the game, improve open play scoring ability and increase substitution awareness."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The present paper thus aims to address this knowledge gap by presenting a concise overview of the lifestyles of Polish students of the Alpha generation. The paper addresses the main factors shaping health in this age group by referring to diet and eating habits, mental health, physical activity, and sleeping, with particular attention given to problems resulting from excessive use of digital media and minimising physical activity.

Conditioning activity (CA) involved three sets of four seconds of full-back squats at 70% 1RM for the experimental group. Jump heights for CMJ and SJ were measured, and absolute (baseline-best) and relative (%) changes were analyzed. For statistical analysis were made with Three-Way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer post-hoc tests to evaluate jump performance differences.\nRESULTS: EXP achieved more gains than control in SQ for both sexes, and both measurement approaches (P<0.05), yet no sex differences in gains were found (P>0.05).

The numerical rating scale (NRS) was used to assess pain intensity at rest, the Oswestry Disability Index was used to estimate the level of disability, and the MyotonPRO© device was used to measure tension, stiffness, and relaxation in the erector spinae on both sides of the lumbar spine. The examinations were performed before the intervention, after interventions, and at 7-day follow-up (RCT Id: ACTRN12624000121561).\nRESULTS: Pain and level of disability were reduced for all groups (P<0.01). In addition, post hoc analysis of the KT group showed significant increases in tension and stiffness of the erector spinae and significantly decreased relaxation between the pre-intervention and follow-up measurements, but only on the contralateral side (P<0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: KT with or without tape tension and PIR had similar effects in decreasing the level of resting pain and disability. Pain reduction was not related to changes in the mechanical properties of the soft tissue. It can be concluded that the KT with or without tape tension or PIR were mainly analgesic effects, and should be used as a combined therapy in LBP patients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Two of the largest social media, which bring together communities with similar interests and needs, are listed.\n\nWhat marketing tools should be used to precisely define the \"target\" of the personal trainer. The processes of planning and implementing sales ideas.\n\nIdentifying the characteristics of social-media.\n\nAssessment of the usefulness of social media in the promotion of personal trainers.\n\nConclusions\nBased on the research, the following conclusions could be drawn.\n1. Social media is a powerful marketing tool nowadays and should be an integral part of the trainers' marketing strategy.\n2. Women use social media more often and are more willing to participate in research and discussions on a healthy lifestyle, they are more open than men. There are more of them in fitness groups, so when planning their activities on the Internet, trainers should take into account women's preferences and try to run their fun pages in such a way that they are interesting for them.\n3. The younger generation is better acquainted with social media and uses it more willingly. People over 30 years of age, that is generations X and Y, were brought up in a time when access to the Internet and social media was impossible or severely limited, therefore it is not a standard for them and they do not use them on a daily basis. [Fries, Kimberly 2017, 5 Reasons Why Millennial Leaders Need Performance Feedback, Forbes]\n4. The vast majority of respondents (98%) admitted that they use social media. This shows the universality of this method of interpersonal communication.\n5. The most used social media are Instagram and Facebook. There are certain trends on the Internet, and Internet users communicate with each other and set up accounts on portals that are currently popular among other users.\n6. More than half of the respondents admitted that they use the help of personal trainers. This shows how much personal trainers have a huge impact on physically active people.\n7. Social media is an effective means of gaining popularity, so personal trainers should use them for that purpose. Nowadays, almost everyone uses the Internet and communicates via various social media, so keeping profiles on them is a very good way to reach a large number of users.\n8. Particularly desired by people interested in the subject of fitness and following the actions of their chosen personal trainers are the effects of work with the mentees, which the trainers publish on their profiles. Their physical characteristics are almost as important.\n9. A large part of personal trainers use social media for marketing purposes.\n10. The most frequently chosen portal by personal trainers is Instagram, its use is extremely simple, and the greatest emphasis is placed on publishing photos, which allows sharing various values ​​in a quick and easy way. Facebook, which has been one of the main networking platforms among Internet users for years, came in second.\n11. The main feature of social media that coaches pay the most attention to when planning their marketing strategy is popularity. They gather the largest number of users at any given time, which may translate into gaining more new recipients. Simplicity and functionality also turned out to be important.\n12. Most of the trainers say that they think social media is very useful for image building and facilitates the customer acquisition process.\n13. Contact between people and enabling them to freely discuss on the Internet is one of the functions that personal trainers consider the most important in social media.\n14. For the optimal use of the power of social media, more than one distribution channel should be used simultaneously.\n15.80% of trainers follow other trainers on social media.\n16. Few of the coaches copy the content of their colleagues, slightly more than 7% of the coaches admitted it.

The study had cross-sectional nature and it used a diagnostic survey method in the form of a direct interview. The following criteria were adopted for the participants’ inclusion in the study: address of residence – one of the selected streets; working age – 18-64 years old; and no chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis and osteoporosis. Two research tools were applied: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire – Short Version (IPAQ-SF) and the Socio-Economic Status Questionnaire (S-ESQ). The total study material was provided by 4332 respondents and 872 individuals were selected (403 unemployed and 469 employed). The analysis of the research results showed that the unemployed Wrocław residents presented a lower level of physical activity than the employed ones. Gender and income significantly determined the level of physical activity, regardless of the respondents’ occupational status. However, among the unemployed their marital status and financial liabilities, and among the employed their level of education and savings were significantly correlated with the level of physical activity. Among the unemployed women from Wrocław, significantly lower levels of physical activity variables were noted, compared to their employed counterparts. The study results allowed concluding that the analysis of the level and conditions of physical activity of the unemployed and the employed should be continued and extended to other subpopulations. This can allow undertaking effective prophylactic and therapeutic actions in relation to social groups most threatened by hypokinesia, including the unemployed. Programs aimed at improving physical activity seem to be particularly important, and should be addressed both to the unemployed and their families."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de49","uid":"bLWzmffcpX6RSmOhITf-UUA","uuid":"51310d3f-60fd-43e1-a210-07d090082219","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Although cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for ECV assessment, computed tomography (CT) offers a viable alternative, particularly in patients with contraindications to MRI. This study aimed to assess whether CT-derived ECV is systematically elevated in cardiac diseases associated with myocardial fibrosis. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science up to January 2023 identified 364 studies, including 16 from registers and 4 from manual searches. After exclusions, 73 studies were included in the systematic review. Of these, 15 provided quantitative data on group sizes, mean ECV values, standard deviations, and imaging modalities (CTA, DECT, LIE-DECT) and were analyzed in the meta-analysis. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated using Cochrane Handbook formulas. Statistical analyses employed random-effects models (R version 4.4.2). Results: The pooled analysis showed that ECV was significantly higher in pathological groups compared to controls (SMD 1.60; 95% CI: 1.23–1.96; I2 = 84.6%). Elevated ECV correlated with worse clinical outcomes, including higher mortality in heart failure and advanced myocardial fibrosis in amyloidosis and cardiomyopathies. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that advanced CT techniques (DECT, LIE-DECT) and CTA provided comparable diagnostic accuracy.

Pathological deposits of neurotoxin proteins within the brain, such as amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles, are prominent features in AD. The prion protein (PrP) is involved in neurodegeneration via its conversion from the normal cellular form (PrPC) to the infection prion protein scrapie (PrPSc) form. Some studies indicated that post-translationally modified PrPC isoforms play a fundamental role in AD pathological progression. Several studies have shown that the interaction of Aβ oligomers (Aβos) with the N-terminal residues of the PrPC protein region appears critical for neuronal toxicity. PrPC-Aβ binding always occurs in AD brains and is never detected in non-demented controls, and the binding of Aβ aggregates to PrPC is restricted to the N-terminus of PrPC. In this study, we aimed to gather all of the recent information about the connections between PrPC and AD, with potential clinical implications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

However, there is a new biomarker, namely, galectin-3 (gal-3), that offers additional predictive value. This cross-sectional study assessed the relationship between serum gal-3 concentrations and CVD risk based on the SCORE scale in a Polish cohort from the PURE study. A total of 259 participants with complete cholesterol, blood pressure (BP), and smoking data were included. Individuals with myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes, or renal failure were excluded. Gal-3 concentrations were measured using ELISA, and statistical analyses examined associations with SCORE categories. The median gal-3 concentration was 221.32(161.64–360.00) ng/mL. Higher gal-3 concentrations were found in older individuals, smokers, and those with elevated BP(p < 0.05). Positive correlations were observed with SCORE values (r = 0.39) and systolic BP (r = 0.64). Participants with SCORE ≥5% had significantly higher gal-3 concentrations. ROC analysis showed moderate diagnostic value for SCORE ≥ 10% (sensitivity 0.618 and specificity 0.810). Higher SCORE and diastolic BP are independent risk factors for increased galectin-3 concentrations, explaining 79.5% of the variance in the studied group.

Autorzy monografii ukazują, jak w sposób holistyczny można realizować ideę zielonego hotelu. Przedstawiają praktyczne możliwości wykorzystania systemów zarządzania środowiskowego. Omawiają sposoby kształtowania zachowań prośrodowiskowych i korzyści, jakie można uzyskać dzięki zielonej infrastrukturze. Książka jest skierowana do szerokiej grupy odbiorców – studentów zarządzania, turystyki, ekonomii, inżynierii produkcji, ochrony środowiska, inżynierii środowiska, a także doktorantów i naukowców. Będzie też przydatna dla przedsiębiorców, menedżerów, osób administrujących organizacjami społecznymi, ekologów oraz decydentów politycznych i samorządowych w kreowaniu polityki ochrony środowiska."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709224878c28a04739083c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

One such emerging biomarker is the left atrioventricular coupling index (LACI). The study aims to evaluate the relationship between the SCORE (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation) and LACI derived from cardiac computed tomography (CCT). Methods: This study included 137 participants (56.09 ± 7.64 years). Cardiovascular risk was assessed using the SCORE system. CCT was performed using the standard coronary computed tomography angiography protocol. LACI was calculated as the ratio of left atrial end-diastolic volume (LA EDV) to left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LV EDV), expressed as a percentage. Results: The subgroup with SCORE ≥5% had higher LACI than the subgroup with SCORE < 5%. Similarly, the subgroup with SCORE ≥10% had higher LACI than the subgroup with SCORE < 10%. LACI demonstrated a significant positive correlation with the SCORE (r = 0.29, p = 0.01). Prediction analysis showed that LACI ≥ 53.34% as a predictor of SCORE ≥ 10% had the highest accuracy of 78.1%, with a high sensitivity of 79.8% and a moderate specificity of 61.5%. High specificity (80.6%) is characterized by LACI ≥ 29.52% as a predictor of SCORE ≥ 5. Conclusions: LACI is a novel and significant biomarker associated with cardiovascular risk, as reflected by its relationship with the SCORE system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

They underwent intense physical exercise, before (7 days) and after which they were measured for HGS and 2D:4D. Height and weight were also measured. Analyses of Covariance were employed to delineate associations.\nResults: 2D:4D had significant predictive effects on the differences in HGS (DHGS) measured in two occasions, without and after, physical exercises.

One hundred and eleven male professional motorcycle speedway riders in the top Polish motorcycle speedway league participated in this study (age: 25.04 ± 6.03 years, height: 172.28 ± 4.76 cm, weight: 65.60 ± 4.66 kg). The riders were divided by the k-means clustering method into three groups of sport level: high (n1 = 31), medium (n2 = 30), low (n3 = 50). To define sport level, several parameters were normalized and aggregated into a new conceptual metric of sport level called ‘Indicator of Sport Level’ (ISL). Body composition assessment, Wingate Anaerobic Test on a cycloergometer, and analysis of acute cardiorespiratory and biochemical responses were performed. One-way ANOVA tests were performed for independent samples, and Pearson’s r linear correlation was calculated between clusters of riders. Multiple linear regression (MLR) was performed to predict the ISL. The elite male motorcycle speedway athletes were characterized by average age (25.10 ± 5.80 years) and years of experience (9.16 ± 5.62 years), which made them different from other clusters (p < 0.05). Also, they were 1.99% taller (173.02 ± 4.91 cm) than low sport level riders (p = 0.003). The strongest predictive variable of sport level in the regression model (R2 = 0.28) was body height (p = 0.043) and sport experience (p < 0.001). The results of this study present the optimal range of physical attributes, body height, sports experience, age, and body surface area of the best motorcycle speedway riders and indicate that body height and experience are the most predictive parameters in the model to estimate the sport level of riders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

It is a non-invasive, widely available and relatively cheap method used mainly in the diagnostics of arrhythmias and a variety of other pathologies, including conduction disturbances and ischemia. ECG is also used to evaluate the activity of a pacemaker or other implantable devices. Medical personnel worldwide routinely use the automatic analysis and interpretation of ECGs to support their medical evaluation of patients’ electrocardiograms.\nMethods: In the current study, we performed a precise analysis of electrocardiograms from 526 different patients and compared it to the automatic interpretations to determine the frequency of false-positive (overinterpretation) and false-negative (underinterpretation) incorrect interpretations.\nResults: It was found that about 39% of ECGs were interpreted incorrectly and amongst the misinterpreted 193 ECG cases, 58% were false-negative, while 57% were false-positive. Additionally, it was revealed that incorrect diagnosis of ischemia (false-positive) was correlated with the body mass index (BMI) of the subjects as well as with the undiagnosed chamber enlargements/hypertrophies. Moreover, we found that in elderly people (>60 years old) a larger number of incorrect diagnoses occurred. The diagnosis of ischemia, which is clinically the most important role of ECG, in our study occurred in 16.1% as a false-positive diagnosis, while in 22.3% ischemia remained unrecognized. Conduction abnormalities were overdiagnosed in 21.8% of cases, while underdiagnosis occurred in 14.5%. Arrhythmias were overdiagnosed in 28% of cases and 17.1% of cases were underdiagnosed.\nDiscussion: In conclusion, we support the statement that relying on the automatic ECG analysis may lead to misinterpretations, which may mislead the medical staff. Automatic analysis of ECG may contain valuable data, although it requires verification and additional knowledge of electrocardiography in every case to achieve a correct and complete interpretation. Results of our studies should increase the caution among clinicians not to rely fully on the automated analysis. Future perspectives should include the application of AI in algorithms used in ECG analysis by manufacturers and paying more attention to accessing proper feedback from clinicians to device manufacturers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

By thematically organizing our review across modifiable domains of cardiovascular health, including glucose regulation, lipid metabolism, physical activity, blood pressure, diet, sleep, tobacco use, and body weight (BMI, body mass index), we highlight the role of gal-3 in linking environmental, behavioral and molecular risk factors to cardiometabolic outcomes. Particular attention is given to the oxidative stress, inflammatory–fibrotic axis, and immune activation as mechanistic pathways underlying gal-3-associated cardiovascular damage. We also discuss its relevance to public health and prevention, considering gal-3’s potential for early risk stratification, monitoring lifestyle interventions and personalized prevention strategies.

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000–000, 2024—The study compared the effects of combining small-sided soccer games (SSGs) with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and repeated sprint training (RST) on aerobic and anaerobic fitness, technical skills, and psychophysiological responses in young soccer players. Thirty-two male, adolescent, soccer players (aged 13.5 ± 0.3 years) were randomly divided into either the SSGs + HIIT group (n = 16) or the SSGs + RST group (n = 16) for combined training 3 times per week for 6 weeks. The players in the SSGs + HIIT group performed 12–18 minutes of runs at intensities (90–95%), whereas the players in the SSGs + RST group consisted of 3–4 sets of 5–7 times 15-m shuttle sprints (all-out efforts). Both training groups played 4 bouts of 2-a-side or 4-a-side SSGs with various game formats at 2-day intervals. Psychophysiological responses were determined during and after all training sessions. Before and after training interventions, the following physical performance tests were used: 5- to 30-m sprint time, countermovement jump, triple-hop distance, zigzag agility with the ball and without the ball, repeated sprint ability (RSA), 30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test, 3 corner run test, speed dribbling ability (SDA), Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 1, and Y-balance test. Our main findings were that the SSGs + RST group demonstrated greater improvement in 5-m sprint time, SDA time, and RSA in the meantime compared with the SSGs + HIIT (p ≤ 0.05, d values ranging from 1.50 to 2.25). Moreover, the SSGs + RST group showed greater improvement in agility test responses (p ≤ 0.05, d values ranging from 2.13 to 2.34) than the SSGs + HIIT group. However, the SSGs + HIIT induced higher perceived exertion, mental effort, and lower greater physical enjoyment meaningfully compared with the SSGs + RST (p ≤ 0.05, d values ranging from 6.04 to 6.67).

Changes in the extracellular volume (ECV) and fibrosis volume (FV) of the myocardium are sensitive and early pathogenetic markers and have prognostic significance. The aim of the study was to assess ECV and FV of left ventricular myocardium in T1 mapping sequence in patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, considering vaccination status against COVID-19. The study group consisted of 97 patients (52.54 ± 8.31 years, 53% women and 47% men). The participants were divided into three subgroups: A) patients with a history of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, unvaccinated against COVID-19 (n = 39), B) patients with a history of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a full vaccination schedule against COVID-19 (n = 22), and C) persons without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection constituting the control subgroup (C, n = 36). All patients underwent 1.5 T cardiac magnetic resonance. In subgroup A compared to subgroups B and C, both the ECV whole myocardium and ECV segments 2, 5–6, 8, and 10–11 were statistically significantly higher. In addition, the ECV segment 16 was statistically significantly higher in subgroup A than in subgroup C. Also, the FV whole myocardium was statistically significantly higher in subgroup A in comparison to subgroups B and C. There were no significant differences in ECV and FV between subgroups B and C. In summary, unvaccinated against COVID-19 patients with a history of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have higher myocardial ECV and FV values in the T1 mapping sequence, compared to those without COVID-19 and those suffering from COVID-19, previously vaccinated with the full vaccination schedule."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

However, there is no comprehensive overview of investigations of dry needling in sports and sport recovery. Objectives The objectives were to perform a systematic review of dry needling in sports athletes with an evidence gap map, to identify current gaps in the literature, and to provide stakeholders with direction for future research. Methods Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines were followed. Studies on healthy and injured athletes receiving dry needling were included. Three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched, data were synthesized narratively, key data were summarized quantitatively, and an evidence gap map was created. Results The authors incorporated 24 studies into the current study, encompassing 580 athletes, predominantly involving talent/developmental and highly trained/national-level athletes across 13 sports. Most studies used passive or placebo controls, with 37.5% incorporating active controls. Interventions focused mainly on the lower limbs (58.3%). Around 69% of studies reported pain perception outcomes, while six examined muscular strength, activity, and range of motion. While results varied, dry needling generally showed a more positive efect on pain than on athletic performance. Conclusions Dry needling studies seem to describe general efectiveness and safety for reducing pain and muscle stifness in a wide variety of body regions. However, further research is needed on underrepresented populations such as elite, world-class, and Paralympic athletes, as well as expanding investigations into long-term efects and a broader range of muscle groups, particularly the hamstrings. The results may be valuable for medical professionals, sports medicine specialists, and researchers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

A polymorphism present in the gene encoding for alpha-actinin-3 (ACTN3) potentially influences sports performance, since this protein is a structural component of skeletal muscle contributing to muscle contraction effectiveness. Aim: To investigate whether the presence of the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism is associated with decathlon athletes’ performance in the different modalities of decathlon. Methods: Thirty-one male athletes from the Brazilian national federation of decathlon aged between 18 and 50 years were genotyped for the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The athletes’ latest decathlon performances were recorded over ten competitions. The Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was verified. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was utilized to assess the relationship between the obtained sports performance (score) by event and sets of events (speed events, jumps, and throws) with significance considered at p < 0.05. Results: Strong and significant correlations were identified between the speed events, the jumping, and the launching performances. Among the athletes, the distribution of ACTN3 genotypes was as follows: R577R—51.6%, R577X—48.4%, and X577X—0%, indicating a complete absence of homozygosity for the non-functional X allele in this cohort. No significant differences in sports performance (score) could be observed based on the genotype. Conclusions: Our results may support the importance of the ACTN3 genotype, specifically, the presence of the 577R allele, as one of the contributive factors for athletes’ performance in modalities that involve muscle strength, power, and speed. However, given the small sample size and the retrospective nature of this study, further research is warranted."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.
