In addition, they will be minimal in number andof reduced dimension; more precisely,uwill be of dimension(d−1), to include necessarily itsd-th compo-nent, andvwill be of dimension1. The resulting space of well-posedness and stabilization is a suitable, tightBesov space for the fluid velocity component (close toL3(Ω)ford=3) and a corresponding Besov space forthe thermal component,q>d.

The impact of hyperautomation and the increasing pace of change require the integration of maturity assessment with the BPM implementation methodology, including the repetition of maturity assessment for selected groups of processes. This causes an urgent need to adapt both process maturity assessment methods and BPM MMs to changing working conditions and business requirements. This conceptual paper is based on a model approach. The framework presented in the article continues and at the same time clearly deviates from the tradition of building BPM MMs on the basis of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). It proposes a two-stage comprehensive process of organizational process maturity assessment, fully integrated into the process of BPM implementation and further business process management. The presented framework makes it possible to assess the process maturity of Industry 4.0 organizations in which dynamic knowledge-intensive business processes (kiBPs) play a key role in creating value."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","5e709479878c28a0473bde28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"171–198","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d8","mniswId":"8331","title":"Information Systems and E-Business Management","issn":"1617-9846","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"739b7989-71dd-46b1-89f4-d97f3cd3f9bd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"624ac0492467f01ec7fcc221","year":"2022","volume":"20","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"5a6ece26-9ce9-40aa-9972-c09a6c0f0813"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Business process management (BPM)","BPM maturity models (BPM MM)","Process nature","Industry 4.0","Digital transformation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747057644488"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709460878c28a0473bbbb2","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wasielewska-Michniewska","uuid":"7AC38E766400919F5105968D58CBEACEC4CA05765138568D6854E0AC9D6E612DBC361D82892AC468833F6AAC7F34A0FA87AFF8EBFC6DC459D2C51E5CE37E9333","documentHash":"650618eb-edb9-4d99-bd37-453b9670bf3f"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394e98","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Paprzycki","uuid":"5B7C90E72D40497375F5BA78D1C4DB9BB79A6D4D7BB177AD034994CA885AAF6ED7617D5EF01EEBCCF0178890D10A52D5AC35FE1F7603165AE8C861AE672BCCD5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8069-2152","documentHash":"3f20fd48-b1cd-4c97-952f-84211d07be00"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a04739297b","name":"Maria","lastName":"Ganzha","uuid":"FE26E0DC9CD7FD1F79C4A997D7DC8891B9C0EE91BFE7ED751B9AB870736888AA93D8E9937A2CD6224547116A9D8C7FEB856D1DF950682C0D3DEC77E6B271B193","orcidId":"0000-0001-7714-4844","documentHash":"e6181dd5-2e2f-4441-b7d3-6ba79a91c547"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fcec","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Denisiuk","uuid":"27192462C883979219F3990A98436A5DF24BA932A77932407003904E2D235E6270520E1B7E499BC7424DF607A229DE16E2CFDF573253AB8AF7BB2337CBB69FCC","orcidId":"0000-0002-7501-7048","documentHash":"01fe1ea3-4566-4271-889a-ab530202edb0"}],"objectId":"61d8232d2467f030c1a42f21","publicUri":"https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/79494","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Feature Extraction for Polish Language Named Entities Recognition in Intelligent Office Assistant","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The purpose of this contribution is to present a feature extractor that was designed as a part of a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system, which is to be used in a Robotic Process Automation application with a self-learning ability.

Experiments show that the entities are recognized with a rate that is satisfactory from the business perspective."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709264878c28a047394e98","5e709460878c28a0473bbbb2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fcec"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1320-1329","conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574175e","mniswId":"575","fullName":"Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","shortName":"HICSS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"8a3c2154-085c-427a-b55a-ed004b652c68"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"61d81f912467f030c1a2fdf3","startDate":"2022-01-03","endDate":"2022-01-07","fullName":"55th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","shortName":"HICSS 55","city":"Virtual, Online","country":"US","website":"https://hicss.hawaii.edu/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"bcadf3ab-5fd0-43cb-aab4-14b17b7f5b98"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709217878c28a04738fcec","5e709241878c28a04739297b","5e709460878c28a0473bbbb2","5e709264878c28a047394e98"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"61d81e762467f030c1a2a73e","title":"Proceedings of the 55th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","year":2022,"isbn":"978-0-9981331-5-7","issn":"2572-6862","url":"https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/79307","translation":false,"documentHash":"f7d0fd94-b8d2-4bc6-b8b9-a6d533642939"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Data, Text, and Web Mining for Business Analytics","decision trees","named entity recognition","robot process automation","semantic context"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747057854918"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61dc097a2467f07650bb2907","name":"Franco","lastName":"Ruzzenenti","orcidId":"0000-0001-7903-0920","documentHash":"70c76c0f-b1f2-4836-9eb7-a2bcc6fd47e2"},{"objectId":"61dc097a2467f07650bb2905","name":"Brian","lastName":"Fath","orcidId":"0000-0001-9440-6842","documentHash":"ad57a879-9928-44ab-962f-1e1a20d38e0c"},{"objectId":"61dc097a2467f07650bb2904","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Picciolo","orcidId":"0000-0002-5595-1140","documentHash":"dd47a5a2-70cf-4e9a-b99b-ad1e9ac13a44"},{"objectId":"61dc097a2467f07650bb2902","name":"Freek","lastName":"Janssen","documentHash":"3c4866e3-eb99-4e1c-aca7-1400d74075d6"},{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473baf87","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Iskrzyński","uuid":"8A278E086B4D76E9C1A1DE6BAA7CD90BE56DAE038928FEEFF943EFDA6FB403A2FA621E71D0BF21874F8C7B174114331F0D5AB34E074A046A812DC3424ECF956B","documentHash":"5e87f4cd-9ccc-4be3-869a-3f8b69e15e35"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"61dc09792467f07650bb28fd","doi":"10.1111/jiec.13217","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13217","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Cycling and reciprocity in weighted food webs and economic networks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Artykuł ma charakter wybitnie interdyscyplinarny. Porównuje się w nim krążenie materii w ekosystemach naturalnych i globalnej ekonomii. Pierwszy autor (dr Mateusz Iskrzyński, IBS PAN) wykorzystał stworzoną przez siebie bazę danych o 169 ważonych sieciach troficznych opisujących kto, kogo i ile zjada w, głównie, wodnych ekosystemach naturalnych. Pochodzą one z opublikowanych modeli matematycznych stworzonych przez biologów (http://ecobase.ecopath.org/). Dokonał ich reinterpretacji w języku grafów (sieci) ważonych. Dokonał obliczeń, jaka część przepływającej w każdej sieci materii może zostać przypisana krążeniu (cyklom), wykorzystując tzw. indeks krążenia Finna (Finn Cycling Index, FCI). Zgodnie z pomysłem ekonomisty Franco Ruzzenentiego zbadano zależność krążenia (FCI) od tego, jaki procent wymienianej pomiędzy dwoma wierzchołkami materii płynie w obu kierunkach (reciprocity).\n\nSedno badań polegało na opracowaniu algorytmu obliczeń dla wszystkich sieci, dokonującego analizy statystycznej otrzymanych parametrów. Zależność krążenia od wzajemności (reciprocity) okazała się na tyle silna w przypadku sieci troficznych, że dobrze tłumaczy ją wskazane w pracy prawo potęgowe.\n\nWkład dr. Iskrzyńskiego należy zaliczyć do dyscypliny informatyki technicznej i telekomunikacji, między innymi przez wzgląd na wykorzystanie modeli komputerowych do wypracowania określonych wniosków istotnych w dziedzinie w jakiej zostały zastosowane - w tym wypadku w ekologii systemowej oraz ekonomii. Zakład Modelowania Komputerowego Instytutu Badań Systemowych PAN, w którym zatrudniony jest dr Iskrzyński,  specjalizuje się m.in. w \"Modelowaniu matematycznym systemów statycznych i dynamicznych z zastosowaniami w technice, ochronie środowiska, ekonomii i medycynie.\" Modelowanie to lokuje się pomiędzy informatyką techniczną i telekomunikacją , matematyką stosowaną, fizyką układów złożonych, i daną dziedziną, w której te modele są stosowane."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Networks of mass flows describe the basic structure of ecosystems as food webs, and of economy as input–output tables. Matter leaving a node in these networks can return to it immediately as part of a reciprocal flow, or completing a longer, multi-node cycle. Previous research comparing cycling of matter in ecosystems and economy was limited by relying on unweighted or few networks. Overcoming this limitation, we study mass cycling in large datasets of weighted real-world networks: 169 mostly aquatic food webs and 155 economic networks. We quantify cycling as the portion of all flows that is due to cycles, known as the Finn Cycling Index (FCI). We find no correlation between FCI and the largest eigenvalues of unweighted adjacency matrices used as a cycling proxy in the past. Unweighted networks ignore the actual flow values that in reality can differ by even 10 orders of magnitude. FCI can be decomposed into a sum of contributions of individual nodes. This enables us to quantify how organisms recycling dead organic matter dominate mass cycling in weighted food webs. FCI of food webs has a geometric mean of 5%. We observe lower average mass cycling in the economic networks. The global production network had an FCI of 3.7% in 2011. Cycling in economic networks (input–output tables and trade relationships) and food webs strongly correlates with reciprocity. Encouraging reciprocity could enhance cycling in the economy by acting locally, without the need to perfectly know its global structure."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709459878c28a0473baf87"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"838-849","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709459878c28a0473baf87","61dc097a2467f07650bb2902","61dc097a2467f07650bb2904","61dc097a2467f07650bb2905","61dc097a2467f07650bb2907"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547879f","mniswId":"11421","title":"Journal of Industrial Ecology","issn":"1088-1980","eissn":"1530-9290","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"20e7aefb-430d-4181-a4a4-cb371a418d04"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a17d414097073ee82e256e","year":"2022","volume":"26","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"3a5c6428-af1a-42c6-ba48-41d593a323a0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cycling","economic networks","food webs","industrial ecology","network analysis","reciprocity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747057955276"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"627513eb4097075854f88656","name":"Manuel","lastName":"Esteve","documentHash":"d5577a6f-ca63-4ce7-b22e-42dc95f2e56b"},{"objectId":"627513eb4097075854f88655","name":"Carlos E.","lastName":"Palau","documentHash":"db5ab9c9-7611-462a-9a04-b77905649914"},{"objectId":"627513eb4097075854f88654","name":"Rafael","lastName":"Vaño","documentHash":"8823e32a-063c-4fb4-9f61-59175608efe7"},{"objectId":"627513eb4097075854f88653","name":"César","lastName":"López","documentHash":"6d9484e5-2f18-4304-b2b2-de9d12fa76d5"},{"objectId":"627513eb4097075854f88652","name":"Ignacio","lastName":"Lacalle","documentHash":"affdca97-3d0c-4614-b07c-9a2d75f5bb6e"},{"objectId":"5e709461878c28a0473bbde2","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Szmeja","uuid":"7CCB16B6E7E3B7851245DCD0C8DE2B86D2C529EFDB5B046FDD7D0854477A5B2F76DCE28990A01F0D1D36D257FA492BAAC4D5A2FF30A98547B07B90E40D448B42","orcidId":"0000-0003-0869-3836","documentHash":"aa3d82e8-bd2e-4f7b-b3c8-d7851a0d8c0e"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394e98","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Paprzycki","uuid":"5B7C90E72D40497375F5BA78D1C4DB9BB79A6D4D7BB177AD034994CA885AAF6ED7617D5EF01EEBCCF0178890D10A52D5AC35FE1F7603165AE8C861AE672BCCD5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8069-2152","documentHash":"3f20fd48-b1cd-4c97-952f-84211d07be00"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a04739297b","name":"Maria","lastName":"Ganzha","uuid":"FE26E0DC9CD7FD1F79C4A997D7DC8891B9C0EE91BFE7ED751B9AB870736888AA93D8E9937A2CD6224547116A9D8C7FEB856D1DF950682C0D3DEC77E6B271B193","orcidId":"0000-0001-7714-4844","documentHash":"e6181dd5-2e2f-4441-b7d3-6ba79a91c547"}],"objectId":"627513eb4097075854f88650","doi":"10.1007/978-981-19-1677-9_69","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-1677-9_69","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Tactile Internet in Internet of Things Ecosystems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this contribution is twofold.

The network architecture of the proposed EFRBFNN classifier is considered three types of clustering techniques and four forms of regression polynomials. The proposed classifier can not only fully capture the local distribution (feature) information contained in the data, but also choose effective network architecture for improving classification performance and compactness. Three classes of clustering techniques (such as iterative self-organizing data analysis techniques algorithm (ISODATA), affinity propagation (AP), and extended K-means) are considered to effectively produce membership degrees based on feature information extraction suitable to fit data characteristics. Least Square Error Estimation (LSE) and Weighted Least Square Error Estimation (WLSE)-based learning with four types of regression polynomials are considered to estimate to coefficients of polynomials. MOPSO is exploited for choosing the effective architecture among different clustering techniques, polynomials, and polynomial-based learning with multi-objective parametric optimization. MOPSO helps achieve a sound compromise between the preferred classification performance and the compactness realized with the aid of four objective functions such as a) classification accuracy (CA), b) complexity of clustering, c) complexity of polynomial and d) sum of squared coefficients (SSC). The improvement and effectiveness of the proposed network architecture are quantified on a basis of the comprehensive experimental results and also a comparative analysis is offered to demonstrate the

be society’s predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also hotspots of pollution and disease partly due to current urban and transport practices. The aim of the European Urban Burden of Disease project is to evaluate the health burden and its determinants related to current and future potential urban and transport planning practices and related exposures in European cities and make this evidence available for policy and decision making for healthy and sustainable futures.\n\nMethods and analysis Drawing on an established comparative risk assessment methodology (ie, Urban and Transport Planning Health Impact Assessment) tool), in nearly 1000 European cities we will (1) quantify the health impacts of current urban and transport planning related exposures (eg, air pollution, noise, excess heat, lack of green space) (2) and evaluate the relationship between current levels of exposure, health impacts and city characteristics (eg, size, density, design, mobility) (3) rank and compare the cities based on exposure levels and the health impacts, (4) in a number of selected cities assess in-depth the linkages between urban and transport planning, environment, physical activity and health, and model the health impacts of alternative and realistic urban and transport planning scenarios, and, finally, (5) construct a healthy city index and set up an effective knowledge translation hub to generate impact in society and policy.\n\nEthics and dissemination All data to be used in the project are publicly available data and do not need ethics approval. We will request consent for personal data on opinions and views and create data agreements for those providing information on current and future urban and transport planning scenarios.\n\nFor dissemination and to generate impact, we will create a knowledge translation hub with information tailored to various stakeholders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709287878c28a04739745b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62da5a6b40970752a1f03d14","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d15","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d16","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d17","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d18","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d19","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d1a","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d1b","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d1c","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d1d","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d1e","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d1f","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d20","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d21","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d22","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d23","5e709287878c28a04739745b","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d25","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d26","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d27","62da5a6b40970752a1f03d28"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773f2","mniswId":"2658","title":"BMJ Open","issn":"2044-6055","eissn":"2044-6055","documentHash":"b29ca3f3-84d4-4e41-ab80-14d2c9c20f27"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62da5a6b40970752a1f03d2a","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"1","documentHash":"b41f9313-e738-46c6-a5d1-04b7dfc9579c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["burden of deseases","health impacts","cities"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159651"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f257","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Juszczuk","uuid":"032433C246406D352927925C3AA56EE66136A44F21B3330F100FCD55822D851AF8349FC1098A4A203795CFD0ED50C638AEE457DF19B1150D142D1A2888256D77","orcidId":"0000-0001-7893-5410","documentHash":"c35baa05-cf4b-41ae-baae-d69b09906b43"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391008","name":"Lech","lastName":"Kruś","uuid":"6E05C1C089B70D1267D9C5C4C9068BE162D6F265FCEA88D6BDCE28A32E3D6D58F2F57EB7210D3309A80F8EF27203E4744C833B3F69085522DD470EE08F012588","orcidId":"0000-0002-5946-9757","documentHash":"a7ef6154-8502-4338-9523-369edc71f38f"}],"objectId":"62da808440970752a1f19acf","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-95929-6_15","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95929-6_15","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Investigating the Efficiency of Market Indicators in Trading Systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we evaluate the usability of different market indicators.

As a negative emission technology, the product of PTL could be used in the internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) and thus cause limited shifts in current energy infrastructure and automobile industry compared with the electrification paths. However, it is still unknown whether the PTL technology could be adopted and contributed to reaching carbon neutrality in China's transportation sector. Against this, a novel model of the liquid fuel supply system considering multiple low-emission technologies, including PTL, is constructed to evaluate PTL's potential contribution and cost to the carbon-neutral target of China's transportation sector. Results show the following: First, PTL can achieve a maximum 93% carbon emission reduction compared with oil to liquid (OTL). Second, the most cost-effective deployment strategy for PTL is to increase the total cost by 5–10%. Third, international oil prices and technology-learning effects have significant impacts on the diffusion of PTL. Fourth, PTL can be a supplementary solution to achieve net-zero emissions in the transportation sector."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c5878c28a0473b0946","5e70922b878c28a04739100e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"261","pagesFromTo":"125058","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["630c78954097075e8cd064cd","630c78954097075e8cd064ce","630c78954097075e8cd064cf","5e7093c5878c28a0473b0946","5e70930f878c28a0473a2218","5e70922b878c28a04739100e","630c78954097075e8cd064d2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aaa","mniswId":"5674","title":"Energy","issn":"0360-5442","eissn":"1873-6785","documentHash":"978bb110-bd49-46de-bf9c-ebfebe5d7bb6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6311adbf409707352b688a9a","year":"2022","volume":"261","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"7fdd9bbf-e2ee-468d-8c8d-e99b7c9c07f0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Power to liquid (PTL)","System optimisation","Carbon neutral","Technology learning"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058196380"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"630c72344097075e8cd0274c","name":"Bao Quoc","lastName":"Vo","documentHash":"f6785ad3-a9d5-4a25-a9ff-341d2c05e017"},{"objectId":"630c72344097075e8cd0274b","name":"Minyi","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"37b372fd-cf93-47e0-b86d-1edc8b918ea8"},{"objectId":"630c72344097075e8cd0274a","name":"Qinyuan","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"8d7d7528-024e-4f9b-8f9b-7af1c7233aff"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b824f","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"C34B5BD166A72CFDCC0BB81F0FDB001A2EDE06564A6A420DB551E449F90B32FE4A6FB188EDBECD9DF6A835B4137D2D211C3B8ED329F77D14EF31C15B1A21C073","documentHash":"08e43a2c-24f1-478e-8cb2-5570dec5908f"}],"objectId":"630c72344097075e8cd02748","doi":"10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118279","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118279","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"An efficient algorithm for task allocation with the budget constraint","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper studies a heterogeneous task allocation problem with the budget constraint. Existing works on task allocation mainly tackle this well-known NP-hard problem from an optimisation perspective. They have not been able to cater to the extra needs of scalability and robustness in large-scale systems. Furthermore, some general allocation mechanisms do not consider system budget and agent cost. Thus, they cannot guarantee to obtain valid solutions when the budget is constrained. This paper models the task allocation problem as a game whose players are the agents to be assigned to the teams working on the tasks, and align the task allocation objective (i.e., system optimality) with the game-theoretic solution concept of Nash equilibrium. Based on this formulation, a novel algorithm, called CF, is proposed in this paper. CF searches for a valid Nash equilibrium solution using a greedy strategy that aims to improve system utility while takes into consideration of the overall system budget constraint. CF is a scalable, anytime, and monotonic algorithm, which in turn, makes it robust for the deployment in large-scale systems. CF can also be used as a local search algorithm for improving the quality of any existing valid allocation solution. Comprehensive empirical studies have been carried out in this paper to demonstrate that CF is effective in all budget states and achieves a solution quality better than the state-of-the-art algorithms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709434878c28a0473b824f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"210","pagesFromTo":"1-13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["630c72344097075e8cd0274a","630c72344097075e8cd0274b","630c72344097075e8cd0274c","5e709434878c28a0473b824f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c8b","mniswId":"6463","title":"Expert Systems With Applications","issn":"0957-4174","documentHash":"86318bff-5ce7-4ae2-9671-96ea6abd2d57"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"630c72344097075e8cd02749","year":"2022","volume":"210","documentHash":"61e39c03-fa5e-4478-b483-9e6cc4cfbeff"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Heterogeneous task allocation","Budget constraint","Large-scale","Nash equilibrium","Anytime monotonic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058196614"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62da76b540970752a1f15e90","name":"Tieju","lastName":"Ma","documentHash":"3cdb0f6f-4751-425d-a777-0c536d6b966e"},{"objectId":"62da76b540970752a1f15e8f","name":"Yadong","lastName":"Yu","documentHash":"616a7188-336a-4e71-98cc-049e4a771ec5"},{"objectId":"62da76b540970752a1f15e8e","name":"Shaohui","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"95a95fdb-84de-4472-99b6-f02a17097648"},{"objectId":"62da76b540970752a1f15e8c","name":"Wenji","lastName":"Zhou","orcidId":"0000-0001-8355-8357","documentHash":"20823b67-3ab1-4d5a-9257-82d56762fb09"},{"objectId":"62da76b540970752a1f15e8b","name":"Hongtao","lastName":"Ren","documentHash":"a1e042c8-0e27-4dd9-b587-d61226d72fe3"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0946","name":"Marek","lastName":"Makowski","uuid":"6124BA71FD42D934638D3F4F7E43E06A3398CF92609518BA61E13F66AE11E14560CCB1D905E9B1D012BF8087F12100D351B69EDE50936109281940E9C457403D","documentHash":"cb49a74b-5f3c-49d7-abb4-ea1cbae7895c"}],"objectId":"62da76b540970752a1f15e89","doi":"10.1007/s10479-022-04548-z","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-022-04548-z","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A multi-criteria decision support model for adopting energy efficiency technologies in the iron and steel industry","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Promoting energy efficiency in iron and steel production provides opportunities for mitigating environmental impacts from this energy-intensive industry. Energy efficiency technologies differ in investment costs, fuel-saving potentials, and environmental performance. Hence the decision-making of the adoption strategy needs to prioritize technological combinations concerning these multi-dimensional objectives. To address this problem, this study proposes a hybrid multi-criteria decision-support model for adopting energy efficiency technologies in the iron and steel industry. The modeling framework integrates a linear programming model that determines the optimal technology adoption rates based on the techno-economic, energy, and environmental performance details and an interactive multi-criteria model analysis tool for diverse modeling environments. A real case study was performed in which a total number of 56 energy efficiency technologies were investigated against various criteria concerning economics, energy, and environmental performances. The results examine the tradeoffs and synergies were examined with regard to seven criteria. A balanced solution shows that a total investment of 13.4 billion USD could save 2.51 Exajoule fuel consumption, cut 67.4 million tons (Mton) CO2 emissions, and reduce air pollution of 1.5 Mton SO2, 1.41 Mton NOx, and 0.86 Mton PM, respectively.

To show how the test operates, it is finally applied to two fractional–order transfer functions whose coefficients belong to given intervals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62da604940970752a1f06b2b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"359","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"5559-5574","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62da604940970752a1f06b2a","62da604940970752a1f06b2b","62da604940970752a1f06b2c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478b2f","mniswId":"12902","title":"Journal of the Franklin Institute","issn":"0016-0032","websiteLink":"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-the-franklin-institute","documentHash":"40283ae1-2484-4ddd-b734-2e3cfc42600f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62da604940970752a1f06b2e","year":"2022","volume":"359","number":"11","documentHash":"03224a5b-7286-4256-876e-c1751e72acc9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fractional–order systems","coefficients with interval uncertainties","stability"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058207063"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aada","name":"James","lastName":"Woodcock","documentHash":"75d9cc68-717d-408c-aea7-6c39192715b8"},{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aad9","name":"Søren","lastName":"Brage","documentHash":"927714a6-bf58-42ae-b136-d632eb6cc063"},{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aad7","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Smith","documentHash":"a75eca00-0a0a-4ccd-b1ae-ac2c7d74d9b2"},{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aad6","name":"Alexander","lastName":"Mok","documentHash":"f8872af6-3287-4bc9-8bcf-3d64291ce298"},{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aad5","name":"Yvonne","lastName":"Laird","documentHash":"3ef0042c-39c3-4bba-a549-1d02b31c531d"},{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aad4","name":"Mrudula","lastName":"Utukuri","documentHash":"c51bc2f2-888e-42f2-9dc8-977e7832c7fc"},{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aad3","name":"Saad","lastName":"Khan","documentHash":"04484209-855c-44ae-a437-79b1d987be2a"},{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aad2","name":"Paul","lastName":"Kelly","documentHash":"8befbfec-fdd6-4e3c-82f6-e5af0397c41b"},{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aad1","name":"Rajna","lastName":"Golubic","documentHash":"90985912-f8a5-42f6-bb22-a8d80246574d"},{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aad0","name":"Felipe Barreto","lastName":"Schuch","documentHash":"4225b136-f732-4a01-93e6-a2d0fa0769be"},{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aacf","name":"Tessa","lastName":"Strain","documentHash":"c0a91836-ffaa-422d-90b4-c6ce76433ef4"},{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aace","name":"Ali","lastName":"Abbas","documentHash":"0929a854-d33d-4938-a20f-fedaed5a60af"},{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aacd","name":"Leandro","lastName":"Garcia","documentHash":"b30c12f2-cc8d-48ff-9d9e-4174dbdec064"},{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aacc","name":"Matthew","lastName":"Pearce","documentHash":"e6ec35b7-c703-4730-bb00-ffc51ec2a0e2"},{"objectId":"5e709287878c28a04739745b","name":"Marko","lastName":"Tainio","uuid":"BFC9AB4AC22507AC78C89C6C8BA2B7C99504181EBAF63A66546128D3157D2FDF4BDF97EEBB392A2E517A546F28F08667BF30054185EFFE864EC77981CCCA4572","documentHash":"7de99cdf-ecb6-40bb-aa10-d3e04202bc4b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aaca","doi":"10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.0609","publicUri":"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2790780","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Association Between Physical Activity and Risk of Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Importance  Depression is the leading cause of mental health–related disease burden and may be reduced by physical activity, but the dose-response relationship between activity and depression is uncertain.\n\nObjective  To systematically review and meta-analyze the dose-response association between physical activity and incident depression from published prospective studies of adults.\n\nData Sources  PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and the reference lists of systematic reviews retrieved by a systematic search up to December 11, 2020, with no language limits. The date of the search was November 12, 2020.\n\nStudy Selection  We included prospective cohort studies reporting physical activity at 3 or more exposure levels and risk estimates for depression with 3000 or more adults and 3 years or longer of follow-up.\n\nData Extraction and Synthesis  Data extraction was completed independently by 2 extractors and cross-checked for errors. A 2-stage random-effects dose-response meta-analysis was used to synthesize data. Study-specific associations were estimated using generalized least-squares regression and the pooled association was estimated by combining the study-specific coefficients using restricted maximum likelihood.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures  The outcome of interest was depression, including (1) presence of major depressive disorder indicated by self-report of physician diagnosis, registry data, or diagnostic interviews and (2) elevated depressive symptoms established using validated cutoffs for a depressive screening instrument.\n\nResults  Fifteen studies comprising 191 130 participants and 2 110 588 person-years were included. An inverse curvilinear dose-response association between physical activity and depression was observed, with steeper association gradients at lower activity volumes; heterogeneity was large and significant (I2 = 74%; P < .001). Relative to adults not reporting any activity, those accumulating half the recommended volume of physical activity (4.4 marginal metabolic equivalent task hours per week [mMET-h/wk]) had 18% (95% CI, 13%-23%) lower risk of depression. Adults accumulating the recommended volume of 8.8 mMET hours per week had 25% (95% CI, 18%-32%) lower risk with diminishing potential benefits and higher uncertainty observed beyond that exposure level. There were diminishing additional potential benefits and greater uncertainty at higher volumes of physical activity. Based on an estimate of exposure prevalences among included cohorts, if less active adults had achieved the current physical activity recommendations, 11.5% (95% CI, 7.7%-15.4%) of depression cases could have been prevented.\n\nConclusions and Relevance  This systematic review and meta-analysis of associations between physical activity and depression suggests significant mental health benefits from being physically active, even at levels below the public health recommendations. Health practitioners should therefore encourage any increase in physical activity to improve mental health."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709287878c28a04739745b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"79","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"550-559","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62d7d356409707188ca9aacc","62d7d356409707188ca9aacd","62d7d356409707188ca9aace","62d7d356409707188ca9aacf","62d7d356409707188ca9aad0","62d7d356409707188ca9aad1","62d7d356409707188ca9aad2","62d7d356409707188ca9aad3","62d7d356409707188ca9aad4","62d7d356409707188ca9aad5","62d7d356409707188ca9aad6","62d7d356409707188ca9aad7","5e709287878c28a04739745b","62d7d356409707188ca9aad9","62d7d356409707188ca9aada"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454783c3","mniswId":"9821","title":"JAMA Psychiatry","issn":"2168-622X","eissn":"2168-6238","websiteLink":"http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/issues.aspx","documentHash":"243c641e-aa3b-4053-bdc7-d7d9bd224ede"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d7d356409707188ca9aadc","year":"2022","volume":"79","number":"6","documentHash":"8e3d7af0-feb4-422c-8208-67cc5c5b41e2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["physical activity","risk of depression","inverse curvilinear dose-response"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058207116"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62e1199340970720e7191e26","name":"Olga","lastName":"Karelkina","orcidId":"0000-0003-3851-8481","documentHash":"ff7e3cff-bcca-4dc8-a97d-9050e60bdc9a"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390c8b","name":"Ignacy","lastName":"Kaliszewski","uuid":"B66E410FFACCA1D9B9282EDA404C53E1889A303DFE1E9617748980481E664A567F5C57A9D49B0D7FC7C3672E28C739D611363631C48033CAC9B387E0442E6318","orcidId":"0000-0001-5404-7400","documentHash":"e3471f0e-855e-4027-bf46-d5f4c94494d1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-06-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62e1199340970720e7191e23","doi":"10.1016/j.softx.2022.101109","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2022.101109","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"IDOL: A web application for mixed integer linear multiobjective optimization","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Practical decision-making very often results in complex multiobjective optimization problems that can be solved only by advanced software. At present, it is available for singleobjective optimization and much less for multiobjective optimization. Therefore, the most common approach to multiobjective optimization is to reduce (scalarize) to its singleobjective optimization equivalent. To this aim, the objectives are aggregated into a weighted (parametrized) sum of objectives. However, this form of scalarization does not guarantee that each Pareto optimal solution can be derived. We present a free web-based application to automate scalarizing multiobjective mixed integer optimization problems by a specific form of scalarization, the process which can be tedious for large-scale instances.

The study is based on the existing research literature relating to BPM and knowledge management (KM), and thus investigating how the evolving KE affects the nature of business processes and thus the whole BPM ecosystem. The empirical section of the paper employs action research methodology. The data was collected through internal documentation analysis, interviews, workshops (focus groups), process modelling and, observation during workshops. This part of the study confirmed that the use of the proposed method allows for the diagnosis of the nature of business processes in the organisation, including the identification of the nature of the key processes and their characteristics, which allows selection of the optimal BPM implementation methodology. At the same time, the use of action research allows for efficient communication between management and the team implementing BPM, which has been shown to be a necessary condition for the successful implementation of BPM."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"162-175","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cb31","mniswId":"13325","title":"Knowledge and Process Management","issn":"1092-4604","eissn":"1099-1441","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e7652fd5-be7e-4e1e-98e0-38f510a62fee"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632d691f4097073ab8802faa","year":"2022","volume":"29","number":"2","documentHash":"1feaf1dc-1eaa-4401-bd64-4f3059e86b6a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["business process nature","knowledge economy","action research"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058257966"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633419a34097070fbdd59ded","name":"Audrone","lastName":"Lupeikiene","documentHash":"467c5a09-e32e-4d8a-8d39-bb1d3a92ee40"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde28","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Szelągowski","uuid":"27F74A4788BFD3CE18AFEB15DDFD6AF68BFD26DF42B08C891FC5799E5B821C30B1F9540493266D7BECFDE07FFF614A4D3046CB12C2036C95DBF88BD8E077B779","orcidId":"0000-0002-5114-6793","documentHash":"e3659fe9-4b80-4538-b542-c25ae66f4639"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Berniak-Woźny","uuid":"6138BF6B0A41DA74BFC258AA49BE7E5394626426404BA3AC8D242813245830AFA5AACE0908A279A3C7F928737C7621C8210C452F3DFC7AD46842090E2364BA3B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3156-5755","documentHash":"95feafe5-9ec4-4ca4-8cd3-ceb6bdadc6bf"}],"objectId":"633419a34097070fbdd59dec","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-09850-5_8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-09850-5_8","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"The Direction of the Future Development of ERP and BPMS: Towards a Single Unified Class?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and Business Process Management Suites (BPMS) are implemented in the organization to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and increase profits.

Many results presented in earlier publications indicated local heating installations and car traffic as the main emission categories responsible for this adverse population exposure, where the dominant polluting compounds are NOx, PM10, PM2.5, and BaP. The last two mainly originate from individual household heating installations, both in the city of Warsaw and in its vicinity. To reduce the health risk of air pollution, the city authorities have recently made fundamental decisions, related to the individual housing sector, aimed at the radical decarbonization of all heating installations in Warsaw and its surroundings. On the other hand, the ongoing modernization of the city’s car fleet (including individual and public transport), taking into account the restrictive EU emission standards, as well as the quickly growing share of electric and hybrid cars (BEVs and PHEVs), gives a good prospect of a fundamental improvement in air quality in Warsaw conurbation. The main subject of the paper is a quantitative assessment of the air quality improvement in the current decade (by 2030), resulting from the above modernization activities. The final results are expressed as the attributed reduction in population exposure, which was found to be 28–30% with respect to NOx and PM, and the associated health risk, i.e., 204 fewer avoidable deaths with respect to NOx and 607 fewer with respect to PM2.5."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709232878c28a0473918f1","5e70922b878c28a04739100e","5e709232878c28a0473918ee"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-14","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709232878c28a0473918ee","5e709232878c28a0473918f1","5e70922b878c28a04739100e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724b","mniswId":"2021","title":"Atmosphere","issn":"2073-4433","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"00275c51-5236-4dd8-bc8c-39af87e7bbb0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6339aa264097072262495861","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"10","documentHash":"3e101cce-8397-476c-96b4-45db18323c16"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["urban air quality","emission abatement","emission Euro norms","BEV/PHEV cars","population exposure"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264971"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739100c","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":"1CF7E7126E77D10B28C94B1E5481F8C55BD4C2F14986D43F46FEEA67F45E681C5FC6DA57EA865A94DF0A21ECA5B4FD8980C09D5B520689EDB30B966581B98FC0","orcidId":"0000-0002-4413-1868","documentHash":"33c3049c-1764-44ae-b468-bc9666bb8f86"}],"objectId":"6374eb034097073f40590543","doi":"10.1515/9783110725599-007","publicUri":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110725599-007/xml","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"A fast universal algorithm for finding minimal cut-sets in networks with arbitrary structure","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This contribution presents a newly developed fast algorithm enumerating all minimal cut-sets that separate two distinguished nodes in a graph-modeled network in which both links and nodes are failure-prone. Prior to running the algorithm, the tree of acyclic paths connecting the given pair of nodes has to be constructed (this is not a drawback because many existing algorithms for cut-sets enumeration use this tree in order to eliminate “stub” edges or subgraphs through which no acyclic path passes). Subsequently, the algorithm scans the acyclic paths tree in a bottom-up manner generating successive cut-sets and verifying if they are non-redundant, that is, do not include previously generated cut-sets. Owing to the original verification method, redundant cut-sets are eliminated without being compared to previously found nonredundant ones. Another strong point of the algorithm is that it only operates on the tree of acyclic paths, that is, no other analysis of a network’s topology is performed. It can be applied to networks with both directed and undirected links, and the cut-sets can be composed of both links and nodes. Many algorithms for finding minimal cut-sets assume that all the links are either directed or undirected and/or the nodes are perfectly reliable, which is quite restricting from the practical point of view. The presented algorithm is free from these limitations. Also, the unique cut-sets generation technique makes it significantly faster than many known methods, as confirmed by theoretical analysis and experiments carried out on example networks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a04739100c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"119-130","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a04739100c"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6374ea184097073f4058fef1","doi":"10.1515/9783110725599","title":"Mathematics for Reliability Engineering: Modern Concepts and Applications","year":2022,"isbn":"9783110725599","issn":"2626-5427","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110725599","translation":false,"documentHash":"7033bf6c-f9d4-40ca-9f31-a92c711f5f9c","publisher":{"objectId":"5d4d136d878c286b5030d57f","mniswId":"20400","name":"De Gruyter","documentHash":"4ffcadef-9b27-4236-810c-d9ea54f47e76"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["minimal cut-set","enumeration algorithm","minimal path-set","acyclic paths tree"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058297936"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60e421e29543c723365446a1","name":"Soma","lastName":"Dutta","uuid":"C169C2D7639E668C67A7DFCE84FD01D7BC516584769EAD9E89D75A8A6AEAF026F1B8DFA2F4B00A0B3D04A09C14B4E44F4A2CC22EF60CC5310C21813D3B1B08B3","documentHash":"40fd3907-c136-4246-8fc3-c7d05e4b83b4"},{"objectId":"5e709352878c28a0473a7475","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Skowron","uuid":"5F1926B596FC713500F3E6B7D9075D38399B5A8382DDA7CD65F7F176BEE2523B3D39BADA38F6A62E5C00027AFA887B23F2F8DC823D59FC8F6BD0A565B1833A9C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5271-6559","documentHash":"feedcacc-b75a-4e42-9ceb-fc9cef69a6f5"}],"objectId":"63737d2c4097070c79cdb110","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-21244-4_2","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-21244-4_2","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Rough Sets and Fuzzy Sets in Interactive Granular Computing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper is an attempt to present some grounds that a change is needed in the way of viewing mathematical tools, such as fuzzy sets, rough sets, in the context of classifying and approximating concepts pertaining to the real physical complex phenomenon.

In this regard, a primary proposal has been put forward to model fuzzy sets and rough sets in the framework of Interactive Granular Computing (IGrC)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60e421e29543c723365446a1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709352878c28a0473a7475"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"19-29","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157419a1","mniswId":"1195","fullName":"International Joint Conference on Rough Sets","shortName":"IJCRS (was RSCTC)","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"1e63c7bf-07da-48e8-913a-36fc8833fa14"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"63737d2c4097070c79cdb111","startDate":"2022-11-11","endDate":"2022-11-14","fullName":"International Joint Conference on Rough Sets 2022","shortName":"IJCRS 2022","city":"Suzhou","country":"CN","website":"https://www.ijcrs2022.cn/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"f6668150-c524-47c3-b8c9-7a6f46ad2f9f"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709352878c28a0473a7475","60e421e29543c723365446a1"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Interactions","(Interactive) Granular computing","Perception","Complex granule (c-granule)","Informational granule (ic-granule)","Grounding problem"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058298165"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b45","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Miroforidis","uuid":"829C65C42D934B7829E19305CA23CB7DB1C3F059A8031B7AE72ED4E6EEACC3752D47193388E412A0BA6231C88B92D2C4B4E8B75B962426B4E2BE0AC578931D39","documentHash":"e7f740ac-f37c-4ab8-8121-7f623133c0db"},{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f257","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Juszczuk","uuid":"032433C246406D352927925C3AA56EE66136A44F21B3330F100FCD55822D851AF8349FC1098A4A203795CFD0ED50C638AEE457DF19B1150D142D1A2888256D77","orcidId":"0000-0001-7893-5410","documentHash":"c35baa05-cf4b-41ae-baae-d69b09906b43"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396d54","name":"Dzmitry","lastName":"Padkapayeu","uuid":"D735DED4B2C12072BB2D02487275402DCC6AC903C900581E0261372798C8BDD3B5FA75B4A366B56A18FC5AE0D109755A5F755882A8BE9867A8CF51BF52B250A0","documentHash":"67c18a2b-e5be-4816-a5ad-eb395c471eff"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390c8b","name":"Ignacy","lastName":"Kaliszewski","uuid":"B66E410FFACCA1D9B9282EDA404C53E1889A303DFE1E9617748980481E664A567F5C57A9D49B0D7FC7C3672E28C739D611363631C48033CAC9B387E0442E6318","orcidId":"0000-0001-5404-7400","documentHash":"e3471f0e-855e-4027-bf46-d5f4c94494d1"}],"objectId":"637b600c40970701eefd38eb","doi":"10.1111/itor.13121","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1111/itor.13121","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Expected mean return—standard deviation efficient frontier approximation with low‐cardinality portfolios in the presence of the risk‐free asset","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the expected mean return, standard deviation portfolio selection problem, the first step is usually to derive the set of efficient portfolios, which in the space of objective function values is represented by the efficient frontier. With modern methods and software, it is an easy task even for thousands of assets provided that the problem is continuous. However, investors often introduce the requirement to limit the number of assets in portfolios (portfolio cardinality). The resulting mixed-integer quadratic formulations are computationally much more complex. In this work, we assume that besides risky assets, the risk-free asset is available to the investor, and short selling is not allowed. Since in this case the efficient frontier cannot be directly derived by a quadratic solver, we propose a naive but intuitive heuristic to approximate the efficient frontier in the presence of the risk-free asset. In contrast to the general-purpose evolutionary heuristics, we exploit the underlying mechanism of portfolio composition. We show by numerical experiments that in large-scale instances it works well, even compared to a state-of-the-art evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm. Moreover, the heuristic produces portfolios of remarkably limited cardinalities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ea878c28a04739f257"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7b45","5e709281878c28a047396d54","5e709227878c28a047390c8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"2395-2414","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ea878c28a04739f257","5e709227878c28a047390c8b","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b45","5e709281878c28a047396d54"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547833e","mniswId":"9578","title":"International Transactions in Operational Research","issn":"0969-6016","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"eabb32cd-77b5-4ab4-8136-8f432d1bd05f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6461f9e440970734435a1d3c","year":"2023","volume":"30","number":"5","doi":"","documentHash":"0432d982-f05a-4385-a845-b679619e2d67"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["risk-free asset","mean-variance investing","efficient frontier approximation","portfolio cardinality"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058321187"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709277878c28a0473963a3","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Romaniuk","uuid":"767BDD68EFA5D617757CE0EB29C53999238CB52E0AA86CE917F73BDFD3EF8E4EA86EAA08C5037B3EBED275679E39957688738506AED0E758BC9CD3BCF22336E6","orcidId":"0000-0001-9649-396X","documentHash":"0eb500bd-574a-4ea9-ace1-915ebc0afe47"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047396088","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Grzegorzewski","uuid":"70163A7BEBF26F557A456DE03C92DEA803E3FEC27F715A2E22316A17E482670B010A039C28E033A185AF22C3FFADDE9B51328338A97A6F7787680202C2687835","orcidId":"0000-0002-5191-4123","documentHash":"09d2d281-7359-4f65-8732-4897e7428856"}],"objectId":"62de419c40970762378bdaa2","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-08974-9_39","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-08974-9_39","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Bootstrapped Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test for Epistemic Fuzzy Data","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A typical two-sample problem we deal with in statistical reasoning is to conclude whether the distributions of these samples differ significantly.

The word critical here refers to the usual case where media–damping effects are non–existent or non–measurable and therefore cannot be relied upon for stabilization purposes. Motivated by modeling aspects in high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) technology, the boundary feedback under consideration is supported only on a portion of the boundary. At the same time, the remaining part is undissipated and subject to Neumann/Robin boundary conditions. As such, unlike Dirichlet, it fails to satisfy the Lopatinski condition, a fact which compromises tangential regularity on the boundary [37]. In such a configuration, the analysis of uniform stabilization from the boundary becomes subtle and requires careful geometric considerations and microlocal analysis estimates. The nonlinear effects in the model demand construction of suitably small solutions which are invariant under the dynamics. The assumed smallness of the initial data is required only at the lowest energy level topology, which is sufficient to construct sufficiently smooth solutions to the nonlinear model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927d878c28a0473968d6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1957-1985","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["639732ed40970751e82b435d","5e70927d878c28a0473968d6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477979","mniswId":"5122","title":"Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems - Series S","issn":"1937-1632","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b0a2c762-0de8-4352-9518-b6ad4dd0937c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"639732ed40970751e82b435c","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"8","documentHash":"fcfeb478-4b75-4e7d-bda6-4aad76caaba8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["nonlinear acoustics","second sound","third–order in time","heat-conduction","boundary stabilization","degenerate viscoelasticity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058343101"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63971d1c40970751e82a3ff4","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Triggiani","documentHash":"bb858440-78f9-40ea-a2ea-d6cca1c03478"},{"objectId":"63971d1c40970751e82a3ff3","name":"Marcelo","lastName":"Bongarti","documentHash":"6fc0286b-cebc-4448-9e35-560d2120de21"},{"objectId":"5e70927d878c28a0473968d6","name":"Irena","lastName":"Lasiecka","uuid":"47F509CBE165D4E33E902D196B18DC69D08D7583661F835B89CE9F5D765BB359C047ACF1A2F687E839A4055EDAB4DD4E109FD9ED5CE94984674A4F6D03DAE558","orcidId":"0000-0003-3342-2202","documentHash":"dba59164-8080-4f05-9fb9-fb054956c368"}],"objectId":"63971d1c40970751e82a3ff1","doi":"10.1080/00036811.2021.1999420","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00036811.2021.1999420","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The SMGT equation from the boundary: regularity and stabilization","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We consider the third-order (in time) linear equation known as SMGT-equation, as defined on a multidimensional bounded domain.

This is due to the heat phenomenon known as second sound which leads to hyperbolic heat-wave propagation. In this paper, we consider the problem in the so called \"critical\" case, where free dynamics is unstable. In order to stabilize, we shall use boundary feedback controls supported on a portion of the boundary only. Since the remaining part of the boundary is not \"controlled\", and the imposed boundary conditions of Neumann type fail to saitsfy Lopatinski condition, several mathematical issues typical for mixed problems within the context o boundary stabilizability arise. To resolve these, special geometric constructs along with sharp trace estimates will be developed. The imposed geometric conditions are motivated by the geometry that is suitable for modeling the problem of controlling (from the boundary) the acoustic pressure involved in medical treatments such as lithotripsy, thermotherapy, sonochemistry, or any other procedure involving High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927d878c28a0473968d6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1355-1376","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["639729ec40970751e82ae967","5e70927d878c28a0473968d6","639729ec40970751e82ae968"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477979","mniswId":"5122","title":"Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems - Series S","issn":"1937-1632","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b0a2c762-0de8-4352-9518-b6ad4dd0937c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"639729ec40970751e82ae966","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"6","documentHash":"b6259e68-110a-4355-8a4f-8de910436cb4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["nonlinear acoustics","second sound","third–order in time","heat-conduction","boundary stabilization","degenerate viscoelasticity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058343601"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739100c","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":"1CF7E7126E77D10B28C94B1E5481F8C55BD4C2F14986D43F46FEEA67F45E681C5FC6DA57EA865A94DF0A21ECA5B4FD8980C09D5B520689EDB30B966581B98FC0","orcidId":"0000-0002-4413-1868","documentHash":"33c3049c-1764-44ae-b468-bc9666bb8f86"}],"objectId":"6390700b409707120cc672e8","doi":"10.26408/srsp-2022-11","publicUri":"https://ssars.umg.edu.pl/files/srsp-2022/srsp-2022-11.html","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Estimation of Weibull distribution parameters based on sequences of minimal repairs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A new method of estimating the scale and shape parameters of the Weibull distribution is presented. According to this method, a Weibull distributed time-to-failure (TTF) of a test item is measured m times. It undergoes a minimal repair after each of the first m – 1 failures, and is put out of use after the m-th failure. This procedure is repeated n times. Based on m TTFs of one test item, which are neither independent nor identically distributed (IID), the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) of the scale and shape parameters, called m-sample estimators, are obtained. The accuracy of the m-sample estimators is low, however, it can be improved by using the mean values of their n IID realizations as more precise estimators. The latter are called n.m-sample estimators, have the same biases as the respective m-sample ones, but their variances are n times smaller. Interestingly enough, the n.m-sample estimators of the scale and shape parameters, as well as their biases, are given by relatively simple explicit formulas. This is somewhat unexpected in view of the fact that the standard MLE of the shape parameter, based on IID TTFs of non-repairable test items, is obtained from an equation that cannot be solved analytically."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a04739100c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"163-172","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a04739100c"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"63906e7e409707120cc62e4f","title":"Safety and Reliability of Systems and Processes: Summer Safety and Reliability Seminar 2022","year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-7421-421-6","url":"https://ssars.umg.edu.pl/files/srsp-2022/srsp-2022.html","translation":false,"documentHash":"2ab8fe66-4813-408d-9814-c818c3da9ed3","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8fb","mniswId":"60200","name":"Uniwersytet Morski w Gdyni","documentHash":"c9c116f0-28f2-4783-b1f7-4ba05e2bde16"},"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Weibull distribution","minimal repair","maximum likelihood estimation","gamma function","Euler constant"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058347146"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6398861940970708596d4a32","name":"Audrone","lastName":"Lupeikiene","documentHash":"9a9eaf05-b96f-4653-857c-14f1d90a9367"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde28","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Szelągowski","uuid":"27F74A4788BFD3CE18AFEB15DDFD6AF68BFD26DF42B08C891FC5799E5B821C30B1F9540493266D7BECFDE07FFF614A4D3046CB12C2036C95DBF88BD8E077B779","orcidId":"0000-0002-5114-6793","documentHash":"e3659fe9-4b80-4538-b542-c25ae66f4639"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Berniak-Woźny","uuid":"6138BF6B0A41DA74BFC258AA49BE7E5394626426404BA3AC8D242813245830AFA5AACE0908A279A3C7F928737C7621C8210C452F3DFC7AD46842090E2364BA3B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3156-5755","documentHash":"95feafe5-9ec4-4ca4-8cd3-ceb6bdadc6bf"}],"objectId":"6398861940970708596d4a2f","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-16168-1_21","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16168-1_21","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Future Development of ERP: Towards Process ERP Systems?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Organizations operating in Industry 4.0 and 5.0 use both ERP and BPMS systems. As recently as 10–15 years ago, the reasons behind using these two classes of systems were different. ERPs were used to manage the organization's resources, and BPMS – to support the implementation of business processes, often understood as work or document flows. However, as a result of digital transformation, both business needs as well as ERP and BPMS vendors responding thereto made these two classes of systems overlap to an increasing degree. Thus, the aim of this article is to answer the question: Are we heading towards process-based ERP systems or is the future in the flexible, open integration of postmodernERP and iBPMS? The authors conducted a narrative literature review and content analysis of 88 ERP systems offered on the Polish market. As a result, 11 ERP systems containing functionalities specific to BPMS were identified. Further, to define the essence of the transformation of ERP into process-based ERP systems, 5 expert interviews were conducted, which allowed for the formulation of two approaches to this transformation: the integration of ERP systems with iBPMS as an external subsystem taking over the implementation of selected business processes based on metadata and data of the ERP system; or process management within the ERP system by enabling the configuration of selected processes in ERP subsystems or modules based on a repository of process models, e.g. in BPMN."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","uid":"bLDwoyIU1jG5BHqZ9HzVPQg","uuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Zarządzania z siedzibą w Rzeszowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","parentUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","rootUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"326–341","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741880","mniswId":"878","fullName":"International Conference in Business Process Management","shortName":"BPM","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"456cbf22-8ebe-484e-bee2-a2dcd9558207"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"63c02f9840970702a66f8a90","startDate":"2022-09-11","endDate":"2022-09-16","fullName":"20th International Conference on Business Process Management","shortName":"BPM 2022","city":"Münster","country":"DE","website":"https://bpm2022.uni-muenster.de/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"a2dc5e12-5046-4636-938c-85a5ba719e0b"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","6398861940970708596d4a32"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"63c030a740970702a66f9db1","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-16168-1","title":"Business Process Management: Blockchain, Robotic Process Automation, and Central and Eastern Europe Forum: BPM 2022 Blockchain, RPA, and CEE Forum, Münster, Germany, September 11–16, 2022, Proceedings","year":2022,"isbn":"978-3-031-16167-4","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-16168-1.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"6c5cce39-03f7-49a8-9fc4-bc18f7146adf"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)","postmodern ERP","Business Process Management System (BPMS)","intelligent BPMS (iBPMS)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058350557"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b7889","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Bujnowski","uuid":"BA8978A42FC9B8F884FB0D3427D0920D5FCB19FDFF944F32AC7F4107243DFD1BE96ADADBE3288ED7B2FA06FB4D9C60E15A869A3E336198B558118747F537AFA4","documentHash":"0a2e4275-0045-4b34-ae76-d83f035d307a"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739101c","name":"Eulalia","lastName":"Szmidt","uuid":"ABEBC015C9857F48F7BB0A5F57E80DE8BB665A74A933467463BA3762CD2C1CA967415FAC13F7C606903BE95E8415A9E70EA8925B0EEBD99D1136E79249EAA80A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2192-6905","documentHash":"34baa502-c0bb-49c8-be93-804df5f518fa"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391000","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kacprzyk","uuid":"4A8B2CA444BD6ED60EACF6DE687FF3AF9E95EF07222C91937E5CA1F185E2124FF08DCD7D9A596E8E60911E67B522D3EBFC737B67D6B4294639E916338A719CCB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4187-5877","documentHash":"13701ef2-8325-46ae-a25f-9758ec64477a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-08-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"639998df40970768cd0c564e","doi":"10.2478/candc-2022-0016","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/candc-2022-0016","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Similarity measures for Atanassov’s intuitionistic fuzzy sets: some dilemmas and challenges","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We discuss some aspects of similarity measures in the con-text of Atanassov’s intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs, for short).

This paper addresses the problem of offer formulation during the interaction between buyer and seller software agents for the purpose of reaching an agreement over quantitative and qualitative issues at once. In order to improve the outcome of the negotiation process, a hybrid negotiation method is presented and verified. Offer formulation is based on fuzzy similarity and preference-based methods. The preference-based mechanism is used for quantitative issues, while the fuzzy similarity technique is used for qualitative issues. The preference-based mechanism takes into account the preferences of the opponent when generating offers; the agent makes greater concessions on the issues which the opponent prefers more. The fuzzy-similarity method formulates an offer that considers offering a deal that is more similar to the one received by the opponent during the last round of negotiation. The experiments consists of two parts. The first part compares the hybrid strategy with the basic one. The findings reveal that the hybrid strategy is better in all performance measures, namely, utility rate, agreement rate, and Nash product rate. The second part of the experimental work compares four mechanisms of offer generating mechanisms: basic, preference-based, fuzzy similarity, and hybrid. The results show that the hybrid negotiation strategy performs equal or better that other negotiation strategies. More details can be found in the paper."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709434878c28a0473b824f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-16","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["632d82f24097073ab8830f98","632d82f24097073ab8830f99","632d82f24097073ab8830f9a","5e709434878c28a0473b824f","632d82f24097073ab8830f9b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bfef","mniswId":"5581","title":"Electronics","issn":"2079-9292","eissn":"2079-9292","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"84e7903c-f300-44fa-a9fd-204491284c02"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"630ef00a4097076f717a74ed","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"11","number":"17","documentHash":"b071946f-dcba-417c-888c-f2a3eebb99f4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hybrid strategy","negotiation strategy","automated negotiation","multi-issue negotiation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058371465"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b7889","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Bujnowski","uuid":"BA8978A42FC9B8F884FB0D3427D0920D5FCB19FDFF944F32AC7F4107243DFD1BE96ADADBE3288ED7B2FA06FB4D9C60E15A869A3E336198B558118747F537AFA4","documentHash":"0a2e4275-0045-4b34-ae76-d83f035d307a"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739101c","name":"Eulalia","lastName":"Szmidt","uuid":"ABEBC015C9857F48F7BB0A5F57E80DE8BB665A74A933467463BA3762CD2C1CA967415FAC13F7C606903BE95E8415A9E70EA8925B0EEBD99D1136E79249EAA80A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2192-6905","documentHash":"34baa502-c0bb-49c8-be93-804df5f518fa"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391000","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kacprzyk","uuid":"4A8B2CA444BD6ED60EACF6DE687FF3AF9E95EF07222C91937E5CA1F185E2124FF08DCD7D9A596E8E60911E67B522D3EBFC737B67D6B4294639E916338A719CCB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4187-5877","documentHash":"13701ef2-8325-46ae-a25f-9758ec64477a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63999c5f40970768cd0c8a32","doi":"10.7546/nifs.2022.28.3.193-202","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.7546/nifs.2022.28.3.193-202","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"To what extent can intuitionistic fuzzy options be ranked?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we continue our considerations concerning the ranking of intuitionistic fuzzy alternatives (options, variants, ...).

In this method, the degree of detail in the distribution of data can be easily adjusted using one parameter, and, depending on the value of this parameter, the method produces more detailed or more coarse data clustering, involving more or less of the detected clusters. This key parameter depends on some geometric characteristics of clustered data. It is, of course, possible to generate different divisions using classical k-means, by simply specifying different numbers of clusters to be detected, but in connection with evolutionary method and some information about clustered data it is possible to do it more efficiently and with an additional interpretation for the results.\n\nThe paper presents the evolutionary k-means method, the data considered and the obtained results, compared with the results generated by geographers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391019","5e70922b878c28a047391010"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"436-446","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a047391019","5e70922b878c28a047391010"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"621605da2467f04ac0da6ac1","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-95929-6","title":"Uncertainty and Imprecision in Decision Making and Decision Support: New Advances, Challenges, and Perspectives: Selected papers from BOS-2020, held on December 14-15, 2020, and IWIFSGN-2020, held on December 10-11, 2020 in Warsaw, Poland","year":2022,"isbn":"9783030959289","issn":"2367-3370","url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-95929-6","translation":false,"documentHash":"e8482b47-6830-403b-bc25-71bc77b21086","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Clustering","Adaptive k-means","Evolutionary algorithm","Poland","Municipalities","Typology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058375764"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63a028bb4097072049953ab0","name":"Antonio André","lastName":"Novotny","documentHash":"4011b2ff-3c19-44e2-97b1-4676ec7607a6"},{"objectId":"63a028bb4097072049953aaf","name":"Günter","lastName":"Leugering","documentHash":"64219e99-5289-4256-9f01-f9d6c9837b85"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396dab","name":"Jan","lastName":"Sokołowski","uuid":"D86F76C962EA4F52C42EC0E2867AFE870286266A7B8FACAAA324F869A573E8589798B0DD2700B73686277707B16BBD81D2D84C00FEE9C0AA49AAB989F7376D7A","documentHash":"8831a331-385f-4d75-bf78-45626a80b1b0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-08-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63a028bb4097072049953aae","doi":"10.2478/candc-2022-0015","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/candc-2022-0015","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"On the robustness of the topological derivative for Helmholtz problems and applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We  consider  Helmholtz  problems  in  two  and  threedimensions.

Therefore, the uncertainty of oil prices would greatly impact this country's economic and environmental valuations of alternative liquid fuel technologies. The present study develops an optimization model to analyze the technology portfolio of the liquid fuel industry. Two significant elements constitute this model, namely, the deterministic optimization part and the robust model. They achieve the aims of minimizing the total cost and maximizing the tolerance of data uncertainty under an ellipsoidal uncertainty set. In addition, we also investigate the impact of the increase in carbon prices on the technology portfolio. The results show that alternative technologies will be rapidly developed from 2020 to 2050 under oil price uncertainty, especially coal to liquid fuel (CTL) technology, which can reduce the dependency on crude oil but can generate a large amount of carbon emissions. For reducing the CO2 emissions in the liquid fuel industry, carbon prices have been additionally considered in this research. The results show that the increase in carbon prices could substantially decrease CO2 emissions, but using carbon trading alone cannot achieve the peak of carbon emissions by 2030. Thus, various types of clean technologies, i.e., hydrogen, solar, and wind, should be widely used in energy systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c5878c28a0473b0946","5e70922b878c28a04739100e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"115","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["635b9eda409707035d0e632d","5e7093c5878c28a0473b0946","5e70922b878c28a04739100e","635b9eda409707035d0e632f","635b9eda409707035d0e6330"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ab0","mniswId":"5681","title":"Energy Economics","issn":"0140-9883","documentHash":"b60f1f78-cffb-4b3a-9766-220f6a8985bb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63622aa84097072c44a7c3af","year":"2022","volume":"115","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"78842711-f814-4fa8-81ac-3dc87f27d0f4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Liquid fuel industry","Oil prices","Robust optimization","Carbon prices"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058404338"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63b85eeb4097077b6bf0a593","name":"Pin Pin","lastName":"Oh","documentHash":"adb6ca38-3683-4819-8fe0-6abe076aaad0"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396bdb","name":"Karol","lastName":"Opara","uuid":"87EA036EA878A3AF690AA68ABBFA11F814645A1247FFEE0B145260F08486915D7264FB23206CE77E5E6D69ECB2F29E02A2B4BB26CF4FD8848EF1B2FB50A5D1E1","orcidId":"0000-0002-7149-4031","documentHash":"3748c6a9-f884-4526-9816-34166251ebc1"}],"objectId":"63b85eeb4097077b6bf0a592","doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2021.108286","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.108286","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Regularization and concave loss functions for estimation of chemical kinetic models","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Non-linear regression is the primary tool for estimating kinetic models of chemical reactions. The default approach of minimizing the sum of squared residuals tends to underperform in the presence of systematic errors, non-normal distribution of residuals or identifiability issues such as a high correlation between parameters. Therefore, we argue for a careful choice of the fit criteria and propose new, concave loss functions. Together with regularization, they form a robust objective for the regression procedure. Discussion of the rationale behind the proposed approach and its effects is illustrated by laboratory data on the transesterification of palm oil. A dedicated simulation study complements qualitative examples. All of the top-performing methods use regularization.

The traditional approach to busi-ness processes assumes control of the flow of well-structured activities that the organisation carries out to achieve its goals, and managing them focuses on their improvement through increased efficiency. However, an increasingly important role in the knowledge economy is played by knowledge-intensive business processes, which are highly dependent on hu-man judgment, as well as real knowledge, which requires partially structured and unstruc-tured decision-making. This demands a change in the approach to process management and its improvement, beyond efficiency only. It requires the use of the dynamism of process executors to create value by using and creating knowledge during the execution of pro-cesses. To illustrate this transformation, processes from the healthcare sector were used as a case study, as they encapsulate the limitations of the traditional approach to process man-agement and the need to move to a dynamic one. As a result, two process models were presented, showing the need for a dynamic approach to health process management as a way to create and use rapidly changing knowledge, and to incorporate new technologies that not only increase the efficiency of processes (e.g. automate them), but above all create new knowledge, and use data on patients in real-time."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","uid":"bLDwoyIU1jG5BHqZ9HzVPQg","uuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Zarządzania z siedzibą w Rzeszowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","parentUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","rootUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"48","pagesFromTo":"18-26","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","5e709479878c28a0473bde28"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61d557ec580ac28cb94dcdec","mniswId":"201504","title":"Zeszyty Naukowe Politechniki Częstochowskiej.

Then, model explanations are derived through the popular SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) tool and conveyed in a linguistic form via fuzzy linguistic summaries. The linguistic summarization allows translating the explanations of the model outputs provided by SHAP into statements expressed in natural language. PLENARY accounts for the imprecision related to model outputs by summarizing them into simple linguistic statements and for the imprecision related to the data labeling process by including additional domain knowledge in the form of middle-layer labels. PLENARY is validated on preprocessed speech signals collected from smartphones from patients with bipolar disorder and on publicly available mental health survey data. The experiments confirm that fuzzy linguistic summarization is an effective technique to support meta-analyses of the outputs of AI models. Also, PLENARY improves explainability by aggregating low-level attributes into high-level information granules, and by incorporating vague domain knowledge into a multi-task sequential and compositional multilayer perceptron.

It may be beneficial for them to focus on a limited number of assets filtered out by some meaningful procedure. This, however, can result in selecting portfolios which, in terms of reward and risk, are not efficient in the original set of assets. A challenge is to have ways for determining subsets of assets in which the effect of lost efficiency would be minimal. To meet this challenge, we propose a method for asset reduction, based on the notion of layers of maxima and the concept of nondominated sorting. We conduct experiments on large problems derived from the USA stock market data. Our approach resulted in a much smaller loss of efficiency compared to two representative asset reduction methods known from the literature. We test the approach viability via computational experiments on the mean–variance problem of portfolio selection, with and without the cardinality constraints, and real-life data consisting of up to 1000 assets."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ea878c28a04739f257"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7b45","5e709281878c28a047396d54","5e709227878c28a047390c8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"86","pagesFromTo":"263-272","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ea878c28a04739f257","5e709227878c28a047390c8b","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b45","5e709281878c28a047396d54"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d01c","mniswId":"16941","title":"QUARTERLY REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE","issn":"1062-9769","eissn":"1878-4259","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"5782b257-428e-4ce2-8e34-6c1aac1450da"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"636b8b3a409707100108e35d","year":"2022","volume":"86","documentHash":"df2a33d2-312b-4a20-997a-0865fd41f07d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Portfolio selection","Mean–variance model","Large-scale problems","Asset reduction"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058421600"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bd2aff40970735969c2e81","name":"Kaisa","lastName":"Miettinen","documentHash":"da062174-96f9-48d8-ae5c-59be4868f093"},{"objectId":"63bd2aff40970735969c2e80","name":"Babooshka","lastName":"Shavazipour","documentHash":"33320887-fd01-4eee-b1e9-9fe7e193ea93"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396d54","name":"Dzmitry","lastName":"Padkapayeu","uuid":"D735DED4B2C12072BB2D02487275402DCC6AC903C900581E0261372798C8BDD3B5FA75B4A366B56A18FC5AE0D109755A5F755882A8BE9867A8CF51BF52B250A0","documentHash":"67c18a2b-e5be-4816-a5ad-eb395c471eff"}],"objectId":"63bd2aff40970735969c2e7e","doi":"10.1139/cjfr-2022-0084","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2022-0084","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Interactive decision support and trade-off analysis for sustainable forest landscape planning under deep uncertainty","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Sustainable environmental management often involves long-term time horizons and multiple conflicting objectives and, by nature, is affected by different sources of uncertainty. Many sources of uncertainty, such as climate change or government policies, cannot be addressed using probabilistic models, and, therefore, they can be seen to contain deep uncertainty. In this setting, the variety of possible future states is represented as a set of scenarios lacking any information about the likelihood of occurring. Integrating deep uncertainty into multiobjective decision support increases complexity, calling for the elaboration of appropriate methods and tools. This paper proposes a novel interactive multi-scenario multiobjective approach to support decision-making and trade-off analysis in sustainable forest landscape planning under multiple sources of uncertainty. It includes new preference simulation models aimed at reducing the decision-maker’s cognitive load and supporting the preference elicitation process. The proposed approach is applied in a case study of long-term forest landscape planning with four sustainability objectives in 12 scenarios and a forestry expert as the decision-maker. The approach is demonstrated to be efficient in exploring trade-offs in different scenarios, helping the expert gain deep insights into the problem, understand the consequences of alternative strategies, and find the most preferred robust strategy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396d54"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"52","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1423-1438","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bd2aff40970735969c2e80","5e709281878c28a047396d54","63bd2aff40970735969c2e81"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454774f8","mniswId":"3130","title":"Canadian Journal of Forest Research","issn":"0045-5067","eissn":"1208-6037","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"16d17688-2cb7-4947-8b76-c2c219630f0c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bd2aff40970735969c2e7f","year":"2022","volume":"52","number":"11","documentHash":"f6fd69be-702c-484d-8436-606c43c35cc5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["forest management","climate change","multiobjective optimization","scenario planning","partially known preferences"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058421850"},{"authors":[],"objectId":"63b56a784097076e47984901","doi":"10.1007/978-981-16-6332-1","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-6332-1","type":"EDITED_BOOK","typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","year":2022,"title":"Proceedings of 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Advances and Applications: ICAIAA 2021","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This book gathers outstanding research papers presented in the 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Advances and Application (ICAIAA 2021), held in Poornima College of Engineering, Jaipur, India during 27-28 March 2021.

The structural optimization problem consists in finding such material distribution of the body in contact in terms of phase field function to minimize maximal contact stress and to ensure the uniform distribution of this stress. The Lagrange multiplier technique is used to formulate the set of necessary optimality conditions.

The two-dimensional wheel-rail contact problem between a rigid wheel and an elasto-plastic rail lying on a rigid foundation is considered. The contact phenomenon includes Coulomb friction, frictional heat generation as well as the wear of the contacting surfaces. The displacement and stress of the rail in contact are governed by the coupled elasto-plastic and heat conductive equations. The wear depth function appears as an internal variable in the non-penetration condition updating the gap between the worn surfaces of the bodies. Moreover the dissipated energy due to friction is calculated to evaluate the loss of rail material and to determine the shape of the contacting surfaces during the wear evolution process. This contact problem is solved numerically using the finite element method as well as the operator splitting approach. The plastic flow and friction inequality conditions are reformulated as equality conditions using the nonlinear complementarity functions. The distribution of surface temperatures and stresses as well as the evolution of the shape of the contact surfaces and the wear depth are reported and discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927e878c28a047396b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"63beba1a409707205873e626","fullName":"European Congress on Computational Methods in Applied Sciences and Engineering","shortName":"ECCOMAS Congress","website":"https://www.eccomas.org/conferences/eccomas-congresses/","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"6c1a16e1-aeb0-43be-a06f-5608c0f81edc"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"63bebb9340970720587414c4","startDate":"2022-06-05","endDate":"2022-06-09","fullName":"8th European Congress on Computational Methods in Applied Sciences and Engineering","shortName":"ECCOMAS Congress 2022","city":"Oslo","country":"NO","website":"https://www.eccomas.org/2021/01/22/3542/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"2c607980-a395-4a98-b342-9b2fa9c7ea3f"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927e878c28a047396b56","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ca"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Elasto-plastic contact","wear","energy dissipation","semi-smooth Newton method"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058425371"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63be9f6e40970720587116ad","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Wróblewski","documentHash":"69fa4b78-c681-4e26-8f68-aa27c1a58971"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b56","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Myśliński","uuid":"9C83A6F063FE2F720C598B9D6282690E1CA207C9AB0E4641DA3BDE6AFF4B49ABECFA96140FFED392345738558E0A1A081106E89DDBCB02EEC141F95294EAA7A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0909-3114","documentHash":"267fab46-c039-4419-9a82-95284b2ada39"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63be9f6e40970720587116ac","doi":"10.5220/0011066000003197","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0011066000003197","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Non-linear Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model based on Quantum Dynamics","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper is concerned with the option pricing based on an extended non-linear Black-Scholes model. In literature, non-linear Black-Scholes models are formulated assuming the stochastic asset price volatility, volatile risk-free interest rate or the occurrence of the transaction costs. Since these assumptions are matching better the real market conditions, these models are regarded to be more accurate in option pricing than linear Black- Scholes model. In this paper the option pricing model is derived from non-linear Schrödinger equation. This equation governs the movement of quantum particles which is similar to the volatility of stock prices. The nonlinear Schrödinger equation with external potential terms is formulated. The non-linear Black-Scholes option pricing model is formulated using the transformation of the non-linear Schrödinger equation from complex Hilbert to real Euclidean space. The developed model has been used to predict European call options price based on WIG20 st ock prices. The model parameters have been estimated based on real market data. The method of lines has been used to solve numerically the non-linear option pricing model. The model parameters have been estimated based on real market data. Numerical results are provided and discussed. The obtained results confirm high accuracy of the proposed non-linear model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63be9f6e40970720587116ad","5e70927e878c28a047396b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"26-35","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"61b9ae66ad204581b62ebbe8","mniswId":"2238","fullName":"International Conference on Complexity, Future Information Systems and Risk","shortName":"COMPLEXIS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"dc5cb5a9-e849-43a4-9c6c-69cb40b057e5"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"63be9d09409707205870c5fe","startDate":"2022-04-23","endDate":"2022-04-24","fullName":"7th International Conference on Complexity, Future Information Systems and Risk","shortName":"COMPLEXIS 2022","city":"online streaming","country":"ZZ","website":"https://complexis.scitevents.org/?y=2022","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"a5691a24-a04b-48e1-be70-911ec66d7ae0"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63be9f6e40970720587116ad","5e70927e878c28a047396b56"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"63be9de5409707205870dbd9","doi":"10.5220/0000159400003197","title":"Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Complexity, Future Information Systems and Risk - COMPLEXIS","year":2022,"isbn":"978-989-758-565-4","issn":"2184-5034","url":"https://www.scitepress.org/ProceedingsDetails.aspx?ID=Sbiy3rtPkXo=&t=1","translation":false,"documentHash":"dd12b764-b05d-4256-80bd-ce97cb6b9c98"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Non-linear Schrödinger Equation","Non-linear Black-Scholes Model","Option Pricing","Method of Lines","Model Calibration"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058425373"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656cfc8a40970749a85e7ba5","name":"Giovanna","lastName":"Castellano","documentHash":"580d3b33-7d07-42d2-9bd6-41e21fd485ac"},{"objectId":"656cfc8a40970749a85e7ba4","name":"Gabriella","lastName":"Casalino","documentHash":"cfb8dc74-4180-4e28-9743-96d54366482c"},{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7ce8","name":"Monika","lastName":"Dominiak","uuid":"4EEAD3732AC8B2315D41A10B5B742A561B33905679F6E8B76F77589F64024B60FE9054E583FDA77D5D3B241EBE3BD6F02F803BC1E5B17839DF1CF8007C563426","orcidId":"0000-0002-1423-2289","documentHash":"e51fc305-1eee-4c4a-a4a2-8cf8a2785103"},{"objectId":"5e709460878c28a0473bbb37","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kaczmarek-Majer","uuid":"0087CB6164DB0E85F06F1E33A2F188BD3B4D4B8B535FBDFD1B35F1237A1063F10FC364FE3B1DB1E69F4D42AE88BEBAA8DA8D9BFEBE15113835244D62D71574C8","documentHash":"506043a3-b093-402e-b5cf-5d2037ba7f11"},{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a0473918ef","name":"Olgierd","lastName":"Hryniewicz","uuid":"23CA97097CFB2D4AE572AAAD298CF7D5C0E3B9E7F70A97CA42ACBF81FB08322FF66C6A1C4DCA4000A87FF30E939C331D34E304519A57C48CAAE3E4838824ADFC","orcidId":"0000-0001-9877-508X","documentHash":"2c39abe5-e8b1-49fa-8939-1907610180dc"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63bc13774097075486217107","doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2021.12.049","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025521012706","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Explaining Smartphone-based Acoustic Data in Bipolar Disorder: Semi-Supervised Fuzzy Clustering and Relative Linguistic Summaries","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Smartphones enable to collect large data streams about phone calls that, once combined with Computational Intelligence techniques, bring great potential for improving the monitoring of patients with mental illnesses. However, the acoustic data streams recorded in uncontrolled environments are dynamically changing due to various sources of uncertainty. In addition, such acoustic data are usually difficult to interpret by psychiatrists. Within this study, we propose an approach based on Linguistic Summaries with Fuzzy Clustering (LS-FC) aiming at the development of human-consistent and easily interpretable summaries about relations between acoustic data and mental state of a patient affected by Bipolar Disorder, e.g., Most calls in the state of hypomania have low loudness compared to the state of euthymia [T = 1]. To capture the dynamics of acoustic data streams, we apply a dynamic incremental semi-supervised fuzzy clustering that synthesizes data into clusters. These clusters are represented by prototypes which are used for the construction of the membership functions describing linguistic terms e.g., low loudness, and then, linguistic summaries. The main contribution of this paper is the incorporation of information about clusters’ prototypes in the generation of linguistic summaries. The primary goal of this research is explainability. The semi-supervised learning algorithm is used mainly for deriving clusters and building improved linguistic summaries. Numerical results indicate that linguistic summaries provide intuitive and clear information about voice features in a patient’s affective state and they are consistent with clinical observation. In particular, during most calls in hypomania/mania both the quality of the patient’s voice and the dynamics of change in the spectrum signal reflected in spectral flux are low compared to euthymia.

The assessment of attainment of targets included in these SDGs involves human judgments, preferences, intentions, etc. which are human specific and can often be expressed in natural language possibly with a provision for the handling of imprecision. We propose to use fuzzy logic based linguistic data summaries for the assessment and evaluation of both the essence of SDGs and their fulfillment, and such a form is very human consistent because it uses natural language that is the only fully natural means of articulation and communication for the humans. We show the application of linguistic summaries for the analyses of innovation and innovativeness which is explicitly involved in the ninth sustainable development goal (SDG 9).

The IFSs are one of important and widely used extensions of fuzzy sets. They attracted a lot of attention which is confirmed by many citations. However, some problems are not clearly explained by some researchers, and some misunderstanding is caused by citing some conclusions forgetting about assumptions that were done at the beginning of some mathematical considerations. In effect, some researchers treat the IFSs as equivalent (“equipollent” should be used in that context instead) to the interval-valued fuzzy sets. It is correct, and it is not correct. The crux of a problem lies in the assumptions made at the beginning of the considerations leading to the conclusion. Our goal is to show to the reader that mechanical making use of the conclusions without paying attention to assumptions leading to the conclusions is not (and never was) justified. In other words, we stress that different models may lead to different conclusions so using specific conclusions (taking out from a context/assumptions) as the only valid conclusions is not justified. Unfortunately, such a situation occurs in the case of IFSs. The goal of this paper is to clarify it."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391000","5e70922b878c28a04739101c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"517-527","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a04739101c","5e70922b878c28a047391000"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"63c957f44097074220ce9cb9","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-08971-8","title":"Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems: 19th International Conference, IPMU 2022, Milan, Italy, July 11–15, 2022, Proceedings, Part I","year":2022,"isbn":"9783031089701","issn":"1865-0929","url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-08971-8","translation":false,"documentHash":"c2d6dfa6-13de-4a64-a6e7-44ca4ea9ec65","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Atanassov’s intuitionistic fuzzy sets","Interval-valued fuzzy sets","Assumptions and conclusions"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058449366"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c9a8f74097074220d50f33","name":"Xingyu","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"bcddd048-3453-40c1-beb4-bc5bee0f4678"},{"objectId":"63c9a8f74097074220d50f32","name":"Hao","lastName":"Sun","documentHash":"28df528f-e0b4-4726-a99f-4826e1a097a2"},{"objectId":"63c9a8f74097074220d50f31","name":"Ian","lastName":"Daly","documentHash":"02c23c04-40e4-4cd1-834e-5c4e08d82268"},{"objectId":"63c9a8f74097074220d50f30","name":"Jing","lastName":"Jin","documentHash":"796b5b8a-da57-4b32-b568-937820dbec7e"},{"objectId":"63c9a8f74097074220d50f2f","name":"Wei","lastName":"Liang","documentHash":"89664ccb-3726-451c-9ec1-b8763dd386e4"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e6d","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Cichocki","uuid":"A492EA7996E0A2D8AA1438AFDB549E6A5A1627A6E51EF9CB549D43021827C0CE3BEF148F04062455C1FEEF399F0B443F37BE01513DD8B4FBA42D8808390D6CC8","documentHash":"532d2c49-9c8b-47a0-9afc-e7fc7d95fd74"}],"objectId":"63c9a8f74097074220d50f2d","doi":"10.1007/s11571-022-09892-1","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11571-022-09892-1","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Novel channel selection model based on graph convolutional network for motor imagery","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) is used to capture features associated with motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interface (BCI) with a wide spatial coverage across the scalp.

We present a new method for identifying relevant EEG channels. Our method is based on the assumption that useful channels share related information and that this can be measured by inter-channel connectivity. Specifically, we treat all candidate EEG channels as a graph and define channel selection as the problem of node classification on a graph. Then we design a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) model for channels classification. Channels are selected based on the outputs of our GCN model. We evaluate our proposed GCN-based channel selection (GCN-CS) method on three MI datasets. On three datasets, GCN-CS achieves performance improvements by reducing the number of channels.

Different regions of the brain correspond to various mental activities. Therefore, removing weak task-relevant and noisy channels through channel selection is necessary when decoding a specific type of activity from EEG. It can improve the recognition accuracy and reduce the training time of the subsequent models. This study proposes a novel block sparse Bayesian-based channel selection method for the P300 speller. In this method, we introduce block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) into the channel selection of P300 BCI for the first time and propose a regional smoothing BSBL (RSBSBL) by combining the spatial distribution properties of EEG. The RSBSBL can determine the number of channels adaptively. To ensure practicality, we design an automatic selection iteration strategy model to reduce the time cost caused by the inverse operation of the large-size matrix. We verified the proposed method on two public P300 datasets and on our collected datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method can remove the inferior channels and work with the classifier to obtain high-classification accuracy. Hence, RSBSBL has tremendous potential for channel selection in P300 tasks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709273878c28a047395e6d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63cbe7d34097070d6acaf434","63cbe7d34097070d6acaf435","63cbe7d34097070d6acaf436","63cbe7d34097070d6acaf437","63cbe7d34097070d6acaf438","63cbe7d34097070d6acaf439","5e709273878c28a047395e6d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d5c","mniswId":"6842","title":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","issn":"1662-5161","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"a66b2dd2-8a98-4e5c-9165-d41ef42e73a0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"623853ac2467f067af12132d","year":"2022","volume":"16","documentHash":"027d1af7-50fd-4fd3-90bd-6973aa861f2b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["channel selection","sparse bayesian learning","temporal correlation","brain-computer interface","EEG","P300"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058452889"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d2826040970773d5410646","name":"Yuankai","lastName":"Hu","documentHash":"f74c641b-14e3-4769-b78e-6588fe67da47"},{"objectId":"63d2826040970773d5410645","name":"Qirui","lastName":"You","documentHash":"f19dc44b-12d4-46ca-8f7c-3e52f8699c31"},{"objectId":"63d2826040970773d5410644","name":"Fang","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"f9e1186a-4063-44ab-8327-0cd803ae6d76"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"63d2826040970773d5410642","doi":"10.1016/j.inffus.2022.07.012","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2022.07.012","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Two flexibility degrees-driven consensus model in group decision making with intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A group of experts are commonly invited to find an optimal solution to a complex decision making problem. When the bipolarity of decision information should be considered in group decision making (GDM), intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs) have the capability to model such opinions of decision makers (DMs). This paper develops a consensus model in GDM under intuitionistic fuzzy environments with flexibility. First, it is assumed that the initial opinions of DMs are expressed as intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs). A novel additive consistency index is constructed to measure the deviation degree of IFPRs from fuzzy preference relations (FPRs) with additive consistency, where the non-determinacy degree of IFPRs is incorporated. The thresholds of the proposed index corresponding to IFPRs with acceptable additive consistency are discussed and computed. Second, the consensus level of DMs is defined using the similarity degree between two IFVs. An optimization problem is established by maximizing the fitness function, which is constructed by linearly combining the proposed additive consistency index and consensus level. Two flexibility degrees are offered to each DM such that the initial opinions with the bipolarity can be adjusted correspondingly. Third, individual IFPRs in GDM are optimized using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Numerical examples are carried out to illustrate the proposed consensus model by comparing with the existing ones. The obtained results reveal that the proposed additive consistency index can reflect the inherent property of IFPRs. Different with the previous studies, two original flexibility degrees are proposed to characterize the multi-granularity of decision information in GDM."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"88","pagesFromTo":"86-99","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d2826040970773d5410644","63d2826040970773d5410645","63d2826040970773d5410646","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d0","mniswId":"8320","title":"Information Fusion","issn":"1566-2535","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c64b5410-c718-42f9-9f6b-d517eb0fed3e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d2826040970773d5410643","year":"2022","volume":"88","documentHash":"61373c3c-4e6d-46c1-812b-f4a073b2f8bb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Group decision making (GDM)","Intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation (IFPR)","Additive consistency index","Consensus level","Optimization"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058466939"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d2979740970773d54269fd","name":"Byung-Gun","lastName":"Ryu","documentHash":"eaa6ce07-cc7f-4071-b0e6-9b46274477aa"},{"objectId":"63d2979740970773d54269fc","name":"Zunwei","lastName":"Fu","documentHash":"5bb9a4c9-0f44-4f35-bb80-0f75189a9860"},{"objectId":"63d2979740970773d54269fb","name":"Jianlong","lastName":"Qiu","documentHash":"ed6f7d0a-68df-4e40-9d12-81be04285583"},{"objectId":"63d2979740970773d54269fa","name":"Sung-Kwun","lastName":"Oh","documentHash":"923b985d-1bf9-4f1b-9be1-0b96a58d338b"},{"objectId":"63d2979740970773d54269f9","name":"Kun","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"7d8f37f2-51ef-4890-af49-84ddddf3f441"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"63d2979740970773d54269f7","doi":"10.1016/j.aei.2022.101695","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2022.101695","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Design of data feature-driven 1D/2D convolutional neural networks classifier for recycling black plastic wastes through laser spectroscopy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, two types of convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are designed to handle the problem of classifying black plastic wastes.

When it comes the classification problem of black plastic wastes, effective classification techniques by the laser spectroscopy of Fourier Transform-Infrared Radiation (FT-IR) with Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) and Raman to analyze the classification problem of black plastic wastes are introduced. Due to the strong ability of extracting spatial features and remarkable performance in image classification, 1D and 2D CNN through data features are designed as classifiers. The technique of chemical peak points selection is considered to reduce data redundancy. Furthermore, through the selection of data features based on the extracted 1D data with peak points is introduced.

The availability of thermal cameras has provided an essential alternative to explore regions where other optical sensors lack in capturing interpretable signals. A thermal camera captures an image using the heat difference emitted by objects in the infrared spectrum, and object detection in thermal images becomes effective for autonomous driving in challenging conditions. Although object detection in the visible spectrum domain has matured, thermal object detection lacks effectiveness. A significant challenge is the scarcity of labeled data for the thermal domain, which is essential for SOTA artificial intelligence techniques. This work proposes a domain adaptation framework that employs a style transfer technique for transfer learning from visible spectrum images to thermal images. The framework uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to transfer the low-level features from the visible spectrum domain to the thermal domain through style consistency. The efficacy of the proposed object detection method in thermal images is evident from the improved results when using styled images from publicly available thermal image datasets (FLIR ADAS and KAIST Multi-Spectral)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"121","pagesFromTo":"1-13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d29ab340970773d5429958","63d29ab340970773d5429959","63d29ab340970773d542995a","63d29ab340970773d542995b","63d29ab340970773d542995c","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477150","mniswId":"1519","title":"Applied Soft Computing Journal","issn":"1568-4946","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"890e228a-57d2-4fd2-951d-0b511604feff"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d29ab340970773d5429957","year":"2022","volume":"121","documentHash":"9d711d7e-e51c-40ac-85cf-4de7509438ae"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058467540"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d78c8e4097074c74250945","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Gupta","documentHash":"7cfb0d7d-4c63-4280-847a-9f7e7e47e0eb"},{"objectId":"63d78c8e4097074c74250944","name":"Mukesh","lastName":"Kumar Mehlawat","documentHash":"fa7a3640-c9e2-4833-8605-8ac885f29d75"},{"objectId":"63d78c8e4097074c74250943","name":"Anisha","lastName":"Khaitan","documentHash":"f7bd8e88-ed69-4072-ad04-ea4c56d40960"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"63d78c8e4097074c74250941","doi":"10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117655","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117655","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Socially aware fuzzy vehicle routing problem: A topic modeling based approach for driver well-being","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Drivers are essential to any industry offering transportation and logistics services. Ensuring their well-being ensures smooth business and reduces stress factors that cause driver burnout and increase fatigue and stress. Burnout is usually responsible for accidents, absenteeism, and other similar problems, that are best prevented. Therefore, understanding these stress factors and determining ways to overcome them would benefit any related industry. In the proposed approach, we leverage the benefits of natural language processing and the availability of numerous studies on driver burnout, fatigue, and stress to determine the various stress factors and to understand how to address those using a vehicle routing problem. First, topic modeling, a popular natural language processing technique, is used to extract the different topics of discussion around driver burnout, stress, and fatigue. Next, the extracted cases are qualitatively analyzed to ascertain the stress factors that can be controlled through a routing problem and how to do so. Since uncertainty is prevalent in real life, pairwise travel times are assumed to follow different functional forms. Finally, an integrated routing model is developed, and a hybrid genetic algorithm is coded to solve the model. The use of various sources and types of data, viz., structured data for routing and unstructured data for topic modeling, to obtain solutions for routing and driver well-being, simultaneously, is a notable contribution of the proposed approach. Also, the integrated use of qualitative and quantitative research methods and the combination of text analytics and combinatorial optimization to model social problems is a relatively new concept in the vehicle routing literature. Experimental studies on existing datasets provide solutions that illustrate the advantages of the approach. Insights are also provided to assist managers in decision-making under similar scenarios."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"205","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d78c8e4097074c74250943","63d78c8e4097074c74250944","63d78c8e4097074c74250945","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c8b","mniswId":"6463","title":"Expert Systems with Applications","issn":"0957-4174","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f3a6d99e-402b-4782-953d-b20af6cf6650"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d78c8e4097074c74250942","year":"2022","volume":"205","documentHash":"920f5e68-58b0-425a-bab3-4967cf889d31"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fuzzy simulation","Genetic algorithm","Natural language processing","Text analytics","Topic modeling","Vehicle routing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058470348"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d7aed94097074c742a27d2","name":"Lilija","lastName":"Atanassova","documentHash":"9185e43d-7708-459d-9be6-c7f723c04f3a"},{"objectId":"63d7aed94097074c742a27d1","name":"Velin","lastName":"Andonov","documentHash":"98d2c52e-dffa-4d52-a6d8-926f8bca680f"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739101f","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Zadrożny","uuid":"C34AE9CE91E6A1B4C123DDE8FEA58BD66D2144E8AD5551ED1D54D774E4A2E152FA2ADDBF74E3FB1377E7B6BBD67255F2566A7E10A1E4194429AEDCFFD702F891","orcidId":"0000-0002-6642-0927","documentHash":"bb76266c-0da9-4d75-83ef-53badcb12c83"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63d7aed94097074c742a27d0","doi":"10.7546/nifs.2022.28.4.436-441","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.7546/nifs.2022.28.4.436-441","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A new operation over intuitionistic fuzzy pairs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The basic study of fuzzy sets theory was introduced by Lotfi Zadeh in 1965.

The previous approach to the dissimilarities is too restrictive, because the third axiom in the definition of dissimilarity measure assumes the inclusion relation between fuzzy sets. While there exist many pairs of fuzzy sets, which are incomparable to each other with respect to the inclusion relation. Therefore we need some new concept for measuring a difference between fuzzy sets so that it could be applied for arbitrary fuzzy sets. We focus on the special class of so called local divergences. In the next part we discuss the divergences defined on more general objects, namely intuitionistic fuzzy sets. In this case we define the local property modified to this object.

Finally, an application is tested for a volatility exchange rate estimation problem."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391000"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"124","pagesFromTo":"1-11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d7c9e04097074c742dbe79","63d7c9e04097074c742dbe7a","63d7c9e04097074c742dbe7b","5e70922b878c28a047391000"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477150","mniswId":"1519","title":"Applied Soft Computing Journal","issn":"1568-4946","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"890e228a-57d2-4fd2-951d-0b511604feff"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d7caae4097074c742de8e5","year":"2022","volume":"124","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"aaf7ad05-515c-487f-967c-1e90984f4a28"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["OWA operator","Multiple linear regression","GOWA operator","OLS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058470745"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63cff0524097075010fbcc84","name":"Weihua","lastName":"Cao","documentHash":"45e50327-6f83-40fd-a39a-0243f889ba23"},{"objectId":"63cff0524097075010fbcc83","name":"Luefeng","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"99c51515-d7cb-4a41-8a2a-7b90951415a3"},{"objectId":"63cff0524097075010fbcc82","name":"Min","lastName":"Wu","documentHash":"80fb48f8-4ea8-46d0-acb7-50676f0450e7"},{"objectId":"63cff0524097075010fbcc81","name":"Jie","lastName":"Hu","documentHash":"b31173c0-3c4a-4960-8aed-6c69c4d32a5a"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"63cff0524097075010fbcc7f","doi":"10.1016/j.jprocont.2022.02.002","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprocont.2022.02.002","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Real-time dynamic prediction model of carbon efficiency with working condition identification in sintering process","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Accurate prediction of carbon efficiency is a prerequisite for achieving energy saving and consumption reduction in an iron ore sintering process, and is the key to guaranteeing the quality and yield of sintered ore. This paper proposes an original real-time dynamic prediction model for carbon efficiency prediction in the process. A Savitzky–Golay filter is used to eliminate noise of the actual production data collected from a cooperative sintering plant, and the correlation between carbon efficiency and process parameters is determined by mutual information. A modified version of maximum entropy clustering algorithm is presented for identifying working conditions to accurately discriminate between anomalies and normal working conditions. Then, the real-time dynamic prediction model of carbon efficiency based on broad learning is established by taking into account the process characteristics and using the prediction error information under normal working conditions. The proposed model is demonstrated to be valid by carrying out some experiments with actual production data. The experimental comparative analysis show that this model has good generalization capabilities and high real-time prediction accuracy, and is superior to other advanced methods in dynamic prediction of carbon efficiency."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"111","pagesFromTo":"97-105","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63cff0524097075010fbcc81","63cff0524097075010fbcc82","63cff0524097075010fbcc83","63cff0524097075010fbcc84","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789e9","mniswId":"12400","title":"Journal of Process Control","issn":"0959-1524","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4b1b4ec7-20ed-4b28-a6cb-d75ef76f80fa"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63cff0524097075010fbcc80","year":"2022","volume":"111","documentHash":"1abf6974-475b-40d8-8735-da587516646b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Iron ore sintering process","Carbon efficiency prediction","Real-time dynamic prediction model","Working condition identification","Broad learning"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058474795"},{"authors":[],"objectId":"63da7063409707687b08879a","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-96638-6","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-96638-6","type":"EDITED_BOOK","typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","year":2022,"title":"Contemporary Methods in Bioinformatics and Biomedicine and Their Applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This book gathers selected papers from the First International Symposium on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine.

The problem of testing independence becomes much more difficult when the available data are imprecise, incomplete or vague. Although fuzzy modeling provide appropriate tools for dealing with uncertain data, some limitations of fuzzy random variables inhibit the straightforward generalization of the classical tests of independence into fuzzy framework. At the same time, this situation imposes the quest for new solutions that may be applied in fuzzy environment.

However, in such cases, uncertainty arises, and it becomes necessary to build suitable approaches to overcome it. In this direction, this paper discusses a new approach of fuzzy binomial distributions (BDs) and their extensions. Four cases are considered: (1) When the elementary events are fuzzy. Based on this information, the probabilistic distribution of the corresponding fuzzy-random binomial variable is calculated. The conditions of restrictions on this distribution are obtained, and it is shown that these conditions depend on the ratio of success and failure of membership levels. The formulas for the generating function (GF) of the constructed distribution and the first and second order moments are also obtained. The Poisson distribution is calculated as the limit case of a fuzzy-random binomial experiment. (2) When the number of successes is of a fuzzy nature and is represented as a fuzzy subset of the set of possible success numbers. The formula for calculating the probability of convolution of binomial dependent fuzzy events is obtained, and the corresponding GF is built. As a result, the scheme for calculating the mathematical expectation of the number of fuzzy successes is defined. (3) When the spectrum of the extended distribution is fuzzy. The discussion is based on the concepts of a fuzzy-random event and its probability, as well as the notion of fuzzy random events independence. The fuzzy binomial upper distribution is specifically considered. In this case the fuzziness is represented by the membership levels of the binomial and non-binomial events of the complete failure complex. The GF of the constructed distribution and the first-order moment of the distribution are also calculated. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a limit distribution and a Poisson distribution are also obtained. (4) As is known, based on the analysis of lexical material, the linguistic spectrum of the statistical process of word-formation becomes two-component when switching to vocabulary. For this, two variants of the hybrid fuzzy-probabilistic process are constructed, which can be used in the analysis of the linguistic spectrum of the statistical process of word-formation. A fuzzy extension of standard Fuchs distribution is also presented, where the fuzziness is reflected in the growing numbers of failures. For better representation of the results, the examples of fuzzy BD are illustrated in each section."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391000"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1-18","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d8f803409707399490fa91","5e70922b878c28a047391000","63d8f803409707399490fa92","63d8f803409707399490fa93","63d8f803409707399490fa94"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bb1c","mniswId":"2219","title":"Axioms","eissn":"2075-1680","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"3bce6f1b-211d-465d-a718-16902a75882e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d8f803409707399490fa90","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"5","documentHash":"6bba6234-9ecd-4ebc-ac63-cef9206d5454"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fuzzy-sets","fuzzy-random variables","distribution generating function","fuzzy binomial distribution","Fuchs distribution"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058494533"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63985ef1409707085969313f","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Triggiani","documentHash":"f06b34d4-0523-4c8d-bc45-15291b704f8a"},{"objectId":"5e70927d878c28a0473968d6","name":"Irena","lastName":"Lasiecka","uuid":"47F509CBE165D4E33E902D196B18DC69D08D7583661F835B89CE9F5D765BB359C047ACF1A2F687E839A4055EDAB4DD4E109FD9ED5CE94984674A4F6D03DAE558","orcidId":"0000-0003-3342-2202","documentHash":"dba59164-8080-4f05-9fb9-fb054956c368"}],"objectId":"63985ef1409707085969313d","doi":"10.1007/s10957-022-02017-y","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-022-02017-y","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Optimal Feedback Arising in a Third-Order Dynamics with Boundary Controls and Infinite Horizon","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We study the optimal control problem over an infinite time horizon for the third-order JMGT equation, defined on a 3-d bounded domain Ω with L2(0,∞;L2(Γ0))-Robin boundary control on one part Γ0 of the boundary Γ, and damping in the Neumann BC on the complementary part Γ1.

However, despite all these efforts, resource constraints (time, memory) often strike back. The ”curse of dimensionality” haunts primarily combinatorial problems, but not only. The issue is even more acute in multiobjective optimization, where several Pareto optimal solutions have to be derived. In our earlier works, we developed a general methodology for multiobjective optimization that allows representing the outcome of a Pareto optimal solution by a hyperrectangle. The sides of the hyperrectangle are defined by lower and upper bounds on the outcome components, i.e., intervals of possible objective function values. Such a representation makes sense if the Pareto optimal solution cannot be derived with the available computation resources. Beyond the research interest, to be of practical value, methodologies of that kind have to be computationally effective and scalable. In this work, we show that our methodology can be effectively coupled with any MIP optimization solver. With that, as long as an analyst is willing to accept a (sufficiently tight) interval representation of the Pareto optimal solution outcome instead of its exact outcome, our methodology scales multiobjective-based analyses well beyond the reach of the MIP solver itself. We operationalize our methodology in the form of a workflow (we nicknamed it Crescent Workflow). We illustrate the workflow working on several large-scale instances of the multiobjective multidimensional 0–1 knapsack problem with three objectives."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7b45","5e709227878c28a047390c8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"5617-5673","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709227878c28a047390c8b","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b45"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790f6","mniswId":"15452","title":"Operational Research","issn":"1109-2858","eissn":"1866-1505","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"52cd5659-efbf-45a3-88a5-0d8fd79c1457"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"639868f740970708596a18b1","year":"2022","volume":"22","number":"5","documentHash":"5427182f-c119-44e5-857f-382f94f35f09"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Multiobjective optimization","Large-scale optimization","Scalability","Budget constrained computing","Pareto optimality","Chebyshev scalarization","Two-sided Pareto front approximations","Multiobjective multidimensional 0–1 knapsack problem"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058495426"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395fcb","name":"Marek","lastName":"Gągolewski","uuid":"D1F789DA719ACDE4F786BBA60CF8D2DE726661D5A7E254F316F4820329A49BCFEEA3CF3ED30E610FD1925A22E44E517CE8570971F86F2FC086AC8F5C20BEE1C0","orcidId":"0000-0003-0637-6028","documentHash":"0308d267-3047-4e3d-a992-4311b211b0b2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6399b5e840970768cd0f324a","doi":"10.18637/jss.v103.i02","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v103.i02","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"stringi: Fast and Portable Character String Processing in R","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Effective processing of character strings is required at various stages of data analysis pipelines: from data cleansing and preparation, through information extraction, to report generation.

of MANO Towards the Cloud-Native Paradigm for the Edge Computing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Management and Orchestration framework (MANO) is the main element of the Network Function Virtualization paradigm. It is in charge of managing the life cycle of virtualized functions, from instantiation to manageability, live configuration, and termination. This kind of framework was originally designed to orchestrate network functions over virtual machines. However, the Cloud-Native approach, based on containers and microservices, has emerged and needs to be included as a part of MANO, to leverage all the inherent benefits that it brings. This contribution identifies the key enablers that have to be addressed, from the MANO perspective, to fully exploit the capabilities and to obtain real added value from implementing this novel approach, focusing mainly on resource-constrained environments. Besides, an analysis of current status of open-source frameworks aiming at the Cloud-Native adaptation is presented, showing that while Cloud-Native approaches vís-a-vis network functions are widely accepted (at least, by the research community), there is still room for further research and integration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709264878c28a047394e98","5e709241878c28a04739297b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-16","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63b448ec40970722144c6178","63b448ec40970722144c6179","63b448ec40970722144c617a","63b448ec40970722144c617b","63b448ec40970722144c617c","5e709241878c28a04739297b","5e709264878c28a047394e98"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"63b447ac40970722144c530c","doi":"10.1007/978-981-19-2980-9","title":"Advanced Computing and Intelligent Technologies: Proceedings of ICACIT 2022","year":2022,"isbn":"9789811929793","issn":"1876-1100","url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-19-2980-9","translation":false,"documentHash":"35de2706-dc1f-412c-a396-aca0c0be51a4","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["MANO","Cloud-Native","NFV","Edge computing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058569548"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63b85ade4097077b6bf06999","name":"Tieju","lastName":"Ma","documentHash":"33e9aa8b-3223-4350-bfe6-bb1661effad8"},{"objectId":"63b85ade4097077b6bf06998","name":"Behnam","lastName":"Zakeri","documentHash":"ce84a922-ae6a-423d-af80-88c536b8c83f"},{"objectId":"63b85ade4097077b6bf06997","name":"Hongtao","lastName":"Ren","documentHash":"f5ab504d-a404-4970-aaa4-621d5795badf"},{"objectId":"63b85ade4097077b6bf06996","name":"Jinyang","lastName":"Zhao","documentHash":"57447651-fa07-45d2-ada0-85ed218fa5c4"},{"objectId":"63b85ade4097077b6bf06994","name":"Bingqing","lastName":"Ding","documentHash":"0534bc71-c83f-422a-a925-d5e5f1647ef7"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0946","name":"Marek","lastName":"Makowski","uuid":"6124BA71FD42D934638D3F4F7E43E06A3398CF92609518BA61E13F66AE11E14560CCB1D905E9B1D012BF8087F12100D351B69EDE50936109281940E9C457403D","documentHash":"cb49a74b-5f3c-49d7-abb4-ea1cbae7895c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-01-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63b85ade4097077b6bf06992","doi":"10.1016/j.jmse.2022.07.002","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmse.2022.07.002","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Analysis of technology pathway of China's liquid fuel production with consideration of energy supply security and carbon price","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Efforts to provide alternative resources and technologies for producing liquid fuel have recently been intensified. Different levels of dependence on oil imports and carbon prices have a significant impact on the composition of the cost-minimizing portfolio of technologies. Considering such factors, how should China plan its future liquid fuel industry? The model for supporting the technology portfolio and capacity configuration that minimizes the total system cost until 2045 is described in this study. The results obtained for different carbon prices and levels of dependence on oil import indicate that the oil-to-liquid fuel (OTL) will remain dominant in China's liquid fuel industry over the next three decades. If the carbon price is low, the coal-to-liquid fuel (CTL) process is competitive. For a high carbon price, the biomass-to-liquid fuel (BTL) technology expands more rapidly. The results also reveal that developing the BTL and CTL can effectively reduce the oil-import dependency; moreover, a high carbon price can lead to the CTL being replaced with the low-carbon technology (e.g., BTL). Improvement in energy raw material conversion and application of CO2 removal technologies are also effective methods to control carbon emissions for achieving the carbon emission goals and ultimately emission reduction targets."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c5878c28a0473b0946"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-14","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63b85ade4097077b6bf06994","5e7093c5878c28a0473b0946","63b85ade4097077b6bf06996","63b85ade4097077b6bf06997","63b85ade4097077b6bf06998","63b85ade4097077b6bf06999"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850cb27","mniswId":"29364","title":"Journal of Management Science and Engineering","issn":"2096-2320","eissn":"2589-5532","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"fcdaad0c-5849-419c-916a-edce133f1b8c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63b85ade4097077b6bf06993","year":"2023","volume":"8","number":"1","documentHash":"0faa5d45-af29-4ec9-bd9a-9346ff1e2668"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Liquid fuel production","System optimization model","Energy supply security","Carbon prices"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058576184"},{"authors":[],"objectId":"63bd64884097073596a2c27d","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-20977-2","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-20977-2","type":"EDITED_BOOK","typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","year":2022,"title":"Information, Communication and Computing Technology: 7th International Conference, ICICCT 2022, New Delhi, India, July 16, 2022, Revised Selected Papers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This book constitutes proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Information, Communication and Computing Technology, ICICCT 2022, held in New Delhi, India, in July 2022.\n\nThe 11 papers presented in this volume were carefully reviewed and selected from 65 submissions.

The scene registration, tracking of camera movement and the mapping of a real scene to vector landmark is core activity for AR system. The paper is concentrated with the development of tracking and mapping approach where Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm has been improved based on local optical flow method. In standard ICP based registration methods each image frame is converted to a point cloud and then localized using suitable optimization algorithm. In the proposed method the real world environment is captured as a sequence of RGB-D images and, conversely to the standard ICP method, only suitable subset of points from the image is used for matching point clouds. It leads to the significant reduction of the number of the processed image points. Moreover, point matching technique using local optical flow is applied. Thus costly the point matching step can be abandon in each iteration of optimization in ICP. The proposed approach has been validated by the numerical examples and its improved performance compared to standard ICP approach has been observed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii

Podczas gdy pierwsze podejście pomija indywidualne preferencje decydentów, drugie opiera się najczęściej na domniemaniu, że decydenci są wzajemnie niezależni, co prowadzi do utraty dużej ilości informacji dotyczących faktycznych interakcji między nimi. Ponadto liczne badania dotyczące grupowego podejmowania decyzji nie przywiązywały wystarczającej uwagi do indywidualnego uczestnictwa i satysfakcji poszczególnych decydentów w procesie podejmowania decyzji. Aby przezwyciężyć te słabości, w niniejszym artykule konstruujemy nowy rodzaj modeli konsensusu w celu optymalizacji użyteczności grupy. Wykorzystujemy 2-addytywną całkę Choqueta do agregacji użyteczności poszczególnych decydentów występujących w interakcjach parami. Programowanie liniowe jest używane do wyznaczania rozmytych wag przypisywanych decydentom, które są zgodne z ich częściowym porządkiem podanym przez koordynatora. Ponadto wprowadzamy pojęcia preferencji sprawiedliwych i tolerancyjnego zachowania koordynatora, które modelujemy za pomocą współczynnika Giniego i operatora ‘orness’, eksplorując tym samym wpływ psychologicznych zachowań koordynatora i grupy decydentów na osiąganie konsensusu. Operator ‘orness’ całki Choqueta jest uogólniony do szczególnie użytecznej formy 2-addytywnej z reprezentacją Möbiusa. Wreszcie, przeprowadzamy analizę porównawczą i parametryczną, aby zilustrować i zweryfikować proponowane modele na przykładzie negocjacji cen leków z ubezpieczycielem."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Reaching consensus in group decision-making (GDM) is usually achieved by minimizing opinion deviation (distance) or maximizing the utility of the group in traditional mathematical modeling. While the former ignores the preferences (individual values) of decision-makers (DMs), the latter is most often based on the implicit assumption that DMs are mutually independent, which results in the loss of a large amount of decision-making information about the actual interactions between DMs. Moreover, numerous studies on GDM did not pay enough attention to individual participation and satisfaction in the decision-making process. To overcome these defects, in this paper, we construct a new kind of consensus models for group utility optimization. We employ 2- additive Choquet integral to aggregate the utilities of individual DMs interacting pairwise. Linear programming is used to learn fuzzy measures (weights) that are consistent with a partial preorder of DMs. Moreover, we describe the coordinator’s fairness preference and tolerant behavior with the help of Gini coefficient and orness operator, thus exploring the impacts of coordinator’s psychological behaviors on consensus reaching. The orness operator of the Choquet integral is generalized to a particularly useful 2-additive form with Möbius representation. Finally, a comparative and parametric analysis is performed to illustrate and validate the proposed models on a case study concerning the price negotiation of medical insurance drugs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396da0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396da0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"638","pagesFromTo":"1-21","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["645374624097076a7ad237be","645374624097076a7ad237bc","645374624097076a7ad237bd","5e709281878c28a047396da0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d5","mniswId":"8327","title":"Information Sciences","issn":"0020-0255","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4163795f-444a-41b6-b172-a0bdb2570867"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"645374624097076a7ad237bb","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"638","documentHash":"90f6e957-c937-4929-99a5-3643ede42d98"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Utility preference","Orness operator","Choquet integral","Group decision-making","Gini coefficient","Consensus"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058667028"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6454d484409707605d5d0565","name":"Michał","lastName":"Pawłowski","documentHash":"5e8be870-ac90-4a0f-8e8b-38015312e6c7"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396bc2","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"945DA6E16C90D78458D39308A1998768752D49A1805D54917A3EEEB988E8787854B31A358F57E9D28580C67C5564546092D461B7FC627AD2653971B60EAC7769","orcidId":"0000-0002-9325-4493","documentHash":"01e9dce5-3b73-4594-8fdb-d41b3d8cee0d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-08-22","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6454d484409707605d5d0563","doi":"10.1007/s12652-021-03435-y","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12652-021-03435-y","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Stochastic approach to model spot price and value forward contracts on energy markets under uncertainty","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper deals with a model of electricity spot prices.

Such a problem is modeled by a nonlinear plate evolution equation with stretching effects in the span-wise direction and wind-flow in the chord-wise direction. The motivation is to model a cantilever bridge in order to consider the long-time behavior of a nonlinear elastic structure forced by external/internal inputs. The non-conservative force acting upon the system and the resulting loss of dissipativity of the system are the major features. The dependence of the structure of stationary states on the values of the gas velocity will be analyzed. A numerical approximation with a Morley finite element is adapted to the plate with clamped-free edges, and corresponding numerical computations are provided."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709287878c28a04739744e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1456-1472","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709287878c28a04739744e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c41","mniswId":"6376","title":"Evolution Equations and Control Theory","eissn":"2163-2480","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"9ee0310b-28d0-4ede-be88-52a473b2e51d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64c10cdb409707196b363e95","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"6","doi":"","documentHash":"24952908-b9f7-4edf-be37-5dcd21f34635"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Plate equation","clamped-free boundary conditions","biharmonic operator","numerical method","nonconforming finite element"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058685065"},{"authors":[],"objectId":"646b3552409707633df9d494","publicUri":"https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3380/","type":"PROCEEDINGS","typeName":"Tom pokonferencyjny","year":2023,"title":"Proceedings of the First Workshop on Online Learning from Uncertain Data Streams (OLUD 2022) co-located with IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2022): Padova, Italy, July 18, 2022","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709460878c28a0473bbb37"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"EDITOR"}],"conferenceSeries":{"fullName":"Workshop on Online Learning from Uncertain Data Streams","shortName":"OLUD","website":"https://sites.google.com/view/olud/home","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"b1ee417f-f2bd-424c-b88e-14d2e3576ab7"},"conferenceEdition":{"startDate":"2022-07-18","endDate":"2022-07-18","fullName":"First Workshop on Online Learning from Uncertain Data Streams","shortName":"OLUD -

The novelty of the approach is in presenting a new concept of approximation space which is based on advanced reasoning tools. Many generalisations of the rough set approaches developed over the years are mainly concentrated around reasoning concerning (partial) inclusion of sets. However, such approximation spaces are not satisfactory to deal with important aspects of approximate reasoning by IS's aiming to construct of the high quality approximations of compound decision granules. We demonstrate a number of examples supporting this claim. In particular, in solving the considered in the paper problems are involved complex algorithmic optimization processes directed by reasoning tools supporting searching for (semi-)optimal approximations of decision granules in huge spaces. This paper is a step toward developing tools for derivation of granules supporting IS's in perceiving situations to a degree satisfactory for making the right decisions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709352878c28a0473a7475"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"155","pagesFromTo":"1-16","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a0473937c2","5e709352878c28a0473a7475"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478178","mniswId":"8631","title":"International Journal of Approximate Reasoning","issn":"0888-613X","eissn":"1873-4731","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"096dd274-ace4-40b8-bd44-3195b82bcc3c"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["artificial intelligence","granular computing","rough sets"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058708089"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60e421e29543c723365446a1","name":"Soma","lastName":"Dutta","uuid":"C169C2D7639E668C67A7DFCE84FD01D7BC516584769EAD9E89D75A8A6AEAF026F1B8DFA2F4B00A0B3D04A09C14B4E44F4A2CC22EF60CC5310C21813D3B1B08B3","documentHash":"40fd3907-c136-4246-8fc3-c7d05e4b83b4"},{"objectId":"5e709460878c28a0473bbbab","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Sosnowski","uuid":"EC217826C3BD9E800AC770AAF7ADE389221E20F2AC1F8E13957820A7E9CD930FD81658784A88CEF6276D490CED4BF0FF798350782DBC0179F66E26BB90CBDDBE","documentHash":"95a6e722-9d76-4c3a-905b-ada8f6acfd96"},{"objectId":"5e70933f878c28a0473a5944","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Szymusik","uuid":"263F2AA4940A32163F3998B508E428674FD18EE45588B82195DE70A53A95FB87E6D2078F9B31C260A99E1EA8D2800A000446046406FB1981A99B4FC324DBA7CA","orcidId":"0000-0001-8106-5428","documentHash":"462f35d4-2df9-4827-aaca-4b6a65131654"}],"objectId":"643922e14097077a0cc95642","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-29570-6_4","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-29570-6_4","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Analysis for Women’s’ Menstrual Health Disorders Using Artificial Intelligence","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents some developments related to a project aiming to develop an AI-based model which can determine the possible ovulation dates as well as possibility of some health risks based on the input of a woman for a finite number of menstrual cycles. In some earlier papers, the AI schemes for some health risks, such as PMS, LPD, are already discussed. In this paper, additionally the schemes for hypothyroidism and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are presented. The model is based on a ontology of medical concepts, mathematical formulations of which are designed based on the data obtained from different users over a finite number of menstrual cycles and usual relationships among different parameters determining such concepts. The mathematical formulations of the concerned medical concepts are developed by using some notions of fuzzy linguistic labels and comparators."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709460878c28a0473bbbab"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"71-90","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709460878c28a0473bbbab","60e421e29543c723365446a1","5e70933f878c28a0473a5944"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"64243ec240970754eaf6870f","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-29570-6","title":"Information Technology for Management: Approaches to Improving Business and Society: AIST 2022 Track and 17th Conference, ISM 2022, Held as Part of FedCSIS 2022, Sofia, Bulgaria, September 4–7, 2022, Extended and Revised Selected Papers","year":2023,"isbn":"9783031295690","issn":"1865-1348","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-29570-6.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"087ea45d-5d5f-4a90-ab21-fdb750ab872f","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Menstrual disorders","Menstrual cycles anomaly recognition","AI algorithms","Fuzzy linguistic summaries","Fuzzy comparators"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058735785"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64c23eba4097071bd6b41bbb","name":"Gabriele","lastName":"Scrivanti","documentHash":"14c62566-00bc-48b4-961d-ffec01b71720"},{"objectId":"5ffec3e3085dcb0e357dcd94","name":"The","lastName":"Tran","uuid":"57812B7FEA5328FD1C257E216133A89536B2D9AD99B2AFE092B29B03CFA67093DC30D4D227ADFAFDA02803AF1F93888B4B0F047DB8AF555E3EE85187DF582288","documentHash":"2ab9ba5e-82f0-45ff-9196-7e31c7472846"},{"objectId":"5ffeb1e8085dcb0e357dcc91","name":"Giovanni","lastName":"Bruccola","uuid":"9BDED028381CB41D49D36C92017A270A6C638E69163E6467A34EBD3EDA013A112657205A5EB4FC7A65091AA6C1D441951EAEF9C214CD7EE52EA13F99ABB6757C","documentHash":"59f51ea2-66fd-4550-9b86-20df3d9cb773"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e33","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Bednarczuk","uuid":"00786C1F92B6DFB8848FC968580ADB8E87F33061E6BA27CCB126B4A05E8AC8FCD040C47FF15EDE841732A3185FB08DA6AEE575CC8B0810BB728662D620709E0F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3683-6881","documentHash":"16707363-dc12-421d-8649-363d89cdb85a"}],"objectId":"64c23eba4097071bd6b41bba","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10178118","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Calculus rules for proximal ε-subdifferentials and inexact proximity operators for weakly convex functions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We investigate proximal ε-subdifferentials and derive sum rules that hold for weakly convex function, by incorporating the corresponding moduli of weak convexity into the respective formulas.

Numerical tests demonstrate that the “poor man’s” model is in fact sufficient to price Bermudan interest rate swaptions.

The personalized design of radiotherapy plans has been a relevant challenge since the beginning of these therapies. A wide set of models have been defined to translate complex clinical prescriptions into optimization problems. The model based on the generalized equivalent uniform dose, gEUD, is very relevant for IMRT radiotherapy planning in clinical practice. This way, the expert physicists can tune plans near the prescriptions, solving the optimization problem based on gEUD in a trial-and-error process. The gradient descent methods can be applied for solving these models personalized for every patient. However, their computational requirements are huge. So, to facilitate their use in clinical practice it is necessary to apply HPC techniques to implement such models. In this work, we have developed two parallel implementations of an gEUD model for IMRT planning on multi-core and GPU architectures, as they are increasingly available in clinical settings. Both implementations are evaluated with two Head &Neck clinical tumor cases on modern GPU and multi-core CPU platforms. Our implementations are very useful since they help expert physicists obtain fast plans that can satisfy all the prescriptions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7b45","5e709227878c28a047390c8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"139–150","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741987","mniswId":"1168","fullName":"International Conference on Parallel Processing and Applied Mathematics","shortName":"PPAM","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"b161d35a-1f22-404a-bd7c-2e6669c843eb"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"646899f64097075795a0a496","startDate":"2022-09-11","endDate":"2022-09-14","fullName":"14th International Conference on Parallel Processing and Applied Mathematics","shortName":"PPAM 2022","city":"Gdańsk","country":"PL","website":"https://ppam.edu.pl/prev/ppam2022/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"b6364611-d1b5-42d2-82fb-fe9785e10d78"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64d49be5409707756bdc1e11","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b45","5e709227878c28a047390c8b","64d49be5409707756bdc1e12"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"646899f64097075795a0a495","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-30445-3","title":"Parallel Processing and Applied Mathematics 2022: 14th International Conference, PPAM 2022, Gdansk, Poland, September 11–14, 2022, Revised Selected Papers, Part II","year":2023,"isbn":"978-3-031-30444-6","url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-30445-3","translation":false,"documentHash":"7c20cf3b-3f06-46c1-a017-98f42fe47102"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Radiotherapy Planning","Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)","gEUD models","Gradient Descent","GPU computing","multi-core CPU"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058798089"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64ec8d7540970704b08e7532","name":"Yu.

First, we assume that any reasonable and relatively simple models, reflecting some trading hypotheses, can be profitable for a certain period.

The second proposal is to use a fuzzy multiple-criteria approach at the training optimization stage using historical data in order to overcome or reduce the negative effect of overfitting. Here for the first time, the problem of fuzzy multiple-criteria optimization of trading was formulated and solved based on the output parameters of the developed simple single-criteria crisp models. This provides significantly greater profit than that obtained using single-criteria crisp models. The third proposal is to use the hierarchical structure of fuzzy local criteria to solve the multiple-criteria problem. It is shown that this additionally provides a significant increase in profit.

Specialized smartphone apps can gather such acoustic data without disrupting the daily activities of patients. Nonetheless, the psychiatric assessment of the patient’s mental state is typically a sporadic occurrence that takes place every few months. Consequently, only a slight fraction of the acoustic data is labeled and applicable for supervised learning. The majority of the related work on mental health monitoring limits the considerations only to labeled data using a predefined ground-truth period. On the other hand, semi-supervised methods make it possible to utilize the entire dataset, exploiting the regularities in the unlabeled portion of the data to improve the predictive power of a model. To assess the applicability of semi-supervised learning approaches, we discuss selected state-of-the-art semi-supervised classifiers, namely, label spreading, label propagation, a semi-supervised support vector machine, and the self training classifier. We use real-world data obtained from a bipolar disorder patient to compare the performance of the different methods with that of baseline supervised learning methods. The experiment shows that semi-supervised learning algorithms can outperform supervised algorithms in predicting bipolar disorder episodes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396d6a","5e709232878c28a0473918ef","5e70927e878c28a047396bdb","5e709460878c28a0473bbb37"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"419–428","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6516a90f4097072090ceaa67","6516a90f4097072090ceaa68","5e709232878c28a0473918ef","6516a90f4097072090ceaa69","5e70927e878c28a047396bdb","5e709281878c28a047396d6a","5e709460878c28a0473bbb37"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478175","mniswId":"8624","title":"International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science","issn":"1641-876X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"dfc095e3-860a-4798-924f-bd64ed62bed8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6516a90f4097072090ceaa66","year":"2023","volume":"33","number":"3","documentHash":"1a05d5de-f814-4fa2-9cd1-edaad7067b0f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["semi-supervised learning","mental health monitoring","acoustic features","pattern recognition","AI in medicine"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058881280"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a0473918f1","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kałuszko","uuid":"A71DBE509CCF6C41F8366AF005687C8405FCA8BCBB766F3259D99D9FD281389EDC81BDCA1A919EEB5D82536660F7A05F3FFB481E8046DA31D27ECCF4A3D104A0","documentHash":"27e0e238-1963-4788-828b-7bc00d339195"},{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a0473918ee","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Holnicki-Szulc","uuid":"20DA228C8C4BF24ABF9489B76A3DB8063DB1999BA8D93A652BD28C7F81A3C0D7D51002D55A025F7F559C39B59CE0F9707E5D08E81C35D41D5EC6DAC4B19F0D51","orcidId":"0000-0002-4226-6611","documentHash":"4abb4f2c-5da4-4a51-bc89-1018849c5d77"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739100e","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Nahorski","uuid":"1EF2B08D468D1EF6CA5ABE8126DCD17798EB839E7274A8A4BC24B463FB0BE117628EDF6056801D65239486B31E9BDA80234841E215F38754E9F3EB67B689D6C0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2340-8020","documentHash":"9de9252a-2092-4211-92b7-73f2c543d376"}],"objectId":"65115d7a409707211635a551","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Prognoza jakości powietrza w Warszawie na koniec bieżącej dekady","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"A forecast of air quality in Warsaw by the end of the current decade"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Poziom zanieczyszczenia powietrza w większości dużych miastach europejskich,  stanowi poważne zagrożenie dla zdrowia mieszkańców, będąc źródłem chorób układu oddechowego i przedwczesnej umieralności. O ile w miastach zachodnio-europejskich dominują źródła komunikacyjne, to w Warszawie największe zagrożenie stwarzają zanieczyszczenia pyłowe, emitowane głównie przez źródła powierzchniowe sektora komunalno-bytowego. Ponadto, rosnący ruch samochodowy jest drugim istotnym źródłem emisji zanieczyszczeń, dodatkowo pogarszających jakość powietrza w mieście. Powyższe kategorie emisyjne odpowiadają głównie za zanieczyszczenia pyłem zawieszonym (PM2.5) oraz tlenkami azotu (NOX), które mają udokumentowany i zdecydowanie negatywny wpływ na jakość środowiska oraz zdrowie mieszkańców. \nWładze Warszawy oraz Sejmiku Województwa Mazowieckiego podjęły w roku 2020 zdecydowane działania w celu ograniczenia emisji z sektora komunalnego, wprowadzając restrykcyjne przepisy dotyczące instalacji grzewczych w sektorze komunalnym. Z drugiej strony, naturalna modernizacja floty samochodowej w mieście, przy równocześnie rosnącym udziale samochodów elektrycznych i hybrydowych, umożliwią zmniejszanie stężenia tlenków azotu. Nie bez znaczenia jest realizowana modernizacja transportu publicznego, który do roku 2030 ma być w całości obsługiwany przez autobusy nisko-emisyjne. W omawianej pracy dodatkowo uwzględniono wpływ rządowego programu dekarbonizacji gospodarki z 2021 r. \nPraca prezentuje wyniki symulacji komputerowej, której celem było oszacowanie wpływu powyższych zmian na przewidywaną jakość powietrza w Warszawie na koniec bieżącej dekady. Obliczenia przeprowadzono za pomocą regionalnego modelu dyspersji zanieczyszczeń CALMET/CALPUFF, przy wykorzystaniu danych emisyjnych za rok 2018 jako danych bazowych.

While the urban transportation sources dominate in Western European cities, in Warsaw the greatest impact is due to particulate matter pollution, emitted mainly by the area sources of the municipal sector. In addition, increasing car traffic is the second major source of pollutant emissions, further worsening the air quality in the city. These emission categories are mainly responsible for participium matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) pollution, which have a documented and strongly negative impact on the quality of the environment and the health of the inhabitants.\nIn 2020, the authorities of Warsaw and the Mazovian Voivodeship Parliament took decisive measures to reduce emissions from the municipal sector, introducing restrictive regulations on heating installations in the municipal sector. On the other hand, the natural modernization of the city’s car fleet, with the increasing share of electric and hybrid cars, will enable the concentration of nitrogen oxides to be reduced. It is not without significance that the modernization of public transport, which is to be fully served by low-emission buses by 2030, is being implemented. This analysis also takes into account the impact of the government’s 2021 economic decarbonization program.\nThe study presents the results of a computer simulation aimed at estimating the impact of the above changes on the expected air quality in Warsaw at the end of the current decade. The calculations were carried out using the regional scale dispersion model CALMET/CALPUFF, using the 2018 emission data as the baseline dataset. Based on the results obtained, at the end of the decade, an estimated 30% reduction in residents’ exposure to PM2.5 or PM10 pollution and, respectively, 27% in the case of  NOX pollution can be expected."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709232878c28a0473918f1","5e70922b878c28a04739100e","5e709232878c28a0473918ee"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"211-222","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709232878c28a0473918ee","5e709232878c28a0473918f1","5e70922b878c28a04739100e"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"65115c314097072116359901","title":"Nowoczesne rozwiązania w ochronie środowiska.

With smart meters, more data about how businesses use energy are becoming available to both energy providers and customers. This enables innovation in the structure and type of tariffs on offer in the energy market. Customers can explore their usage patterns to choose the most suitable tariff to benefit from lower prices and thus generate savings. In this paper, we analyzed whether customers’ electricity usage matched their optimal tariff and further investigated which of them could benefit or lose from switching the tariff based on the real dataset with the hourly energy readings of 1212 commercial entities in Poland recorded between 2016 and 2019. Three modelling approaches, i.e., the k-nearest neighbors, classification tree and random forest, were tested for optimal tariff classification, while for the benchmark, we used a simple approach, in which the tariff was proposed based on the customers’ previous electricity usage. The main findings from the research are threefold: (1) out of all the analyzed entities, on average, 76% of them could have benefited from the tariff switching, which suggests that customers may not be aware of the tariff change benefits, or they had chosen a tariff plan that was not tailored to them; (2) a random forest model offers a viable approach to accurate tariff classification; (3) the policy implication from the research is the need to increase the customers’ awareness about the tariffs and propose reliable tools for selecting the optimal tariff.</jats:p>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396e01","5e709210878c28a04738f6d5","5e709274878c28a047396044","5e709281878c28a047396d6a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-17","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709259878c28a047394204","5e709386878c28a0473abf45","65a8f0f84097071977e126d6","65a8f0f84097071977e126d7","65a8f0f84097071977e126d8","5e709274878c28a047396044","5e709210878c28a04738f6d5","5e709281878c28a047396e01","5e709281878c28a047396d6a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["energy consumption","energy efficiency","commercial customers","changing electricity tariff","k-nearest neighbors","classification tree","random forest"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058921854"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"652669a04097070ba4a129e1","name":"Maryna","lastName":"Kabanets","documentHash":"5ced8ae1-b07f-4c65-b110-88ebfc5fa3da"},{"objectId":"652669a04097070ba4a129e0","name":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Vovna","documentHash":"cce6327c-2850-4e2e-a010-9b1a638d4434"},{"objectId":"652669a04097070ba4a129df","name":"Ivan","lastName":"Laktionov","documentHash":"233ee750-2daf-45d7-a07b-c32d59596704"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a0473910f1","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Byrski","uuid":"94F2CA753EDD0D80A3F2DDEF45D4A4A9F1231BA596A92F02DB6424384E6EA4EF895A96B937D816065FCF16EFA1B3952851D66DA03244DF2E788765B966CCD602","orcidId":"0000-0001-6317-7012","documentHash":"3433fd74-9040-4cec-b59a-fafc478ebc14"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e75e","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"A56F3A8C2F6246587B88982FE48FEA2855A7B5222539A126265F1D882510368FD87B8932975E7451D01686982B7D3158DA885EF3F5FFA39E4B9D9EE6FD22470F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6960-9525","documentHash":"715a0529-c457-4823-a66d-ee6bebb7dd83"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"65265cbd4097070ba49b0c86","doi":"10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106938","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197623011223","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A novel approach to intelligent monitoring of gas composition and light mode of greenhouse crop growing zone on the basis of fuzzy modelling and human-in-the-loop techniques","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Gas composition and light mode of industrial greenhouses are some of the most determining factors in the process of growing vegetable crops in greenhouse conditions. The intelligentisation of information technologies for monitoring and control based on artificial intelligence methods can increase the efficiency of agrotechnical procedures for greenhouse cultivation. One of the efficient approaches in today's world practice is the development and implementation of trustworthy hybrid decision-support systems based on the techniques of Fuzzy logic and Human-in-the-Loop. The research object is non-stationary processes of complex intelligent transformation of measurement data on the concentration of carbon dioxide and effective energy illumination in the growing zone of industrial greenhouses. The scientific novelty and practical value of the obtained research results consist in creating a computer model for aggregation and intelligent processing of agricultural monitoring data for greenhouses. The developed computer model is fully transformed into peripheral-level software of Internet of Things systems for agricultural purposes. This makes it possible to implement the for-computing architecture of monitoring systems in greenhouses. The obtained research results make it possible to optimise the resources used in growing crops in greenhouse conditions through the implementation of hardware and software intelligent monitoring tools that are adaptive to the types and periods of crop vegetation. The scientific and applied effect of the research is creating the novel approach of development and practical use of intelligent technologies for agrotechnical monitoring by substantiating the methodological provisions for synthesis of structural and algorithmic organisation of the corresponding software and hardware solutions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"126, Part B","pagesFromTo":"1-21","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["652669a04097070ba4a129df","5e709200878c28a04738e75e","652669a04097070ba4a129e0","5e70922b878c28a0473910f1","652669a04097070ba4a129e1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477abd","mniswId":"5708","title":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","issn":"0952-1976","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"19ed2b1b-ccc4-460e-b276-71b61c0ab49b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ac2cb5409707191d2cbf11","year":"2023","volume":"126, Part B","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"1a081034-9517-40cd-abe4-84e87d12fa0d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Industrial greenhouse","Human-in-the-Loop","Fuzzy logic","Information technology","Carbon dioxide","Lighting intensity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058932421"},{"authors":[],"objectId":"652e50ea40970777572f5026","doi":"10.15439/978-83-969601-3-9","publicUri":"https://annals-csis.org/proceedings/2023/pliks/communication.pdf","type":"PROCEEDINGS","typeName":"Tom pokonferencyjny","year":2023,"title":"Communication Papers of the 18th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709264878c28a047394e98","5e709241878c28a04739297b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"EDITOR"}],"volume":"37","conferenceSeries":{"fullName":"CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS","shortName":"FedCSIS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"8eb81c65-25da-4c93-b8c5-29c2918b99a5"},"conferenceEdition":{"startDate":"2023-09-17","endDate":"2023-09-20","fullName":"18th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems","shortName":"FedCSIS 2023","city":"Warsaw","country":"PL","website":"https://2023.fedcsis.org/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"9e6f935e-55b8-44f8-866c-29f7064cf73f"},"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e709241878c28a04739297b","5e709282878c28a047396f9a","5e709264878c28a047394e98","5e70933c878c28a0473a56d0"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"978-83-969601-3-9","series":"Annals of Computer Science and Information Systems","numberInSeries":"37","translation":false,"editors":[{"objectId":"5e70933c878c28a0473a56d0","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Ślęzak","uuid":"ED8F8DEE018777326FDC3F06A6560F1BB2BB42570E2190FB890DBE888CA741EE8009F4EEA588A53902F3D5DA39664A0403E3495FFDF4D3F75B792A0ECA857304","orcidId":"0000-0003-2453-4974","documentHash":"d705d0b9-b647-47cb-bfba-295564b891da"},{"objectId":"5e709282878c28a047396f9a","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Maciaszek","uuid":"C43EEF32458D57DC76E12925C187E8687079A8E45B12882D47676BF757A01AF7A616E4CEEB7AF5293E2AE5242426F883B5B5ECC5C1DCAB9A3A4B27EF843DF861","orcidId":"0000-0001-6561-0545","documentHash":"09703216-5c4d-460d-b02c-ff320df5cb27"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394e98","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Paprzycki","uuid":"5B7C90E72D40497375F5BA78D1C4DB9BB79A6D4D7BB177AD034994CA885AAF6ED7617D5EF01EEBCCF0178890D10A52D5AC35FE1F7603165AE8C861AE672BCCD5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8069-2152","documentHash":"3f20fd48-b1cd-4c97-952f-84211d07be00"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a04739297b","name":"Maria","lastName":"Ganzha","uuid":"FE26E0DC9CD7FD1F79C4A997D7DC8891B9C0EE91BFE7ED751B9AB870736888AA93D8E9937A2CD6224547116A9D8C7FEB856D1DF950682C0D3DEC77E6B271B193","orcidId":"0000-0001-7714-4844","documentHash":"e6181dd5-2e2f-4441-b7d3-6ba79a91c547"}],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058943980"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6551e9ab40970757f3cbdc3c","name":"V.

Such solutions increasing the sustainability of the urban environment are gaining popularity, especially in Western European agglomerations, where there are currently more than 300 zones, mainly in Italy and Germany. Thus far, there are no LEZs in Eastern and Central European countries, but Warsaw authorities plan to launch an LEZ in 2024. According to the ongoing project, the zone is to be implemented gradually, in five stages between 2024 and 2032, and the emission criteria will be tightened accordingly. The gradually reduced emissions of NOX and PM were utilized as the input dataset in the regional CALPUFF model predictions to calculate the concentrations of these main traffic-induced pollutants within the zone. The direct effect is a reduction in air pollution in the urban center, which is the area most exposed to pollution risk due to heavy traffic. Computer simulations reveal that implementation of the zone in Warsaw will result in a significant reduction in NOX concentrations within the LEZ, such that its mean concentration in the zone becomes comparable to the rest of the conurbation. However, it will bring only a slight reduction in PM2.5 concentrations. This results from the long-standing dominance of coal combustion in the Polish economy. This also applies to the urban municipal sector, being clearly predominant over the road traffic contribution. Balance can be achieved once the de-carbonization process has been completed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709232878c28a0473918f1","5e70922b878c28a04739100e","5e709232878c28a0473918ee"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"1-16","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709232878c28a0473918ee","5e709232878c28a0473918f1","5e70922b878c28a04739100e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65644c2e40970749a8dbe971","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"15","number":"23","documentHash":"26c8396a-cc96-4e5a-915a-20eee2ecb607"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["urban air pollution","road traffic emission","RDE emission test","low emission zone","environmental impact"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059038201"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6569c9d54097077c04786433","name":"Gleb","lastName":"Beliakov","documentHash":"d9403dd1-c047-4caf-88fc-b3c33bf1d477"},{"objectId":"6569c9d54097077c04786432","name":"Simon","lastName":"James","documentHash":"6f2da5c6-710c-4204-9aab-26c6a0570b22"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f55","name":"Anna","lastName":"Cena","uuid":"E471B047EF6E34A5C8BDF0F979AB4BF1946A5EA8D960BFAB25895F722733C05ECA4C6BF33B11556BC110BB40A3E73DDDF0B2ABE6430A68039067E926C818A198","orcidId":"0000-0001-8697-5383","documentHash":"d7083ad9-6ac6-4806-90a9-add254e0e023"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395fcb","name":"Marek","lastName":"Gągolewski","uuid":"D1F789DA719ACDE4F786BBA60CF8D2DE726661D5A7E254F316F4820329A49BCFEEA3CF3ED30E610FD1925A22E44E517CE8570971F86F2FC086AC8F5C20BEE1C0","orcidId":"0000-0003-0637-6028","documentHash":"0308d267-3047-4e3d-a992-4311b211b0b2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"6569c9d54097077c04786430","doi":"10.1016/j.fss.2023.108740","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fss.2023.108740","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Hierarchical clustering with OWA-based linkages, the Lance–Williams formula, and dendrogram inversions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Agglomerative hierarchical clustering based on Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operators not only generalises the single, complete, and average linkages, but also includes intercluster distances based on a few nearest or farthest neighbours, trimmed and winsorised means of pairwise point similarities, amongst many others.

However, the typical problems with minimizing the training error, test error, and avoiding the phenomenon of overfitting must be carefully considered with respect to the characteristics of the SSFCMeans model. In this work, we fill the identified research gap and analyze the way of handling partial supervision in Semi-Supervised Fuzzy C-Means and its impact on the aforementioned issues. We investigate this relationship experimentally using artificially simulated data. We show that the training error for the training phase is directly related to the scaling factor and is deterministically assured to be equal to 0 in some cases.

This is important at a time when city life requires frequent trips to work, school, for shopping, recreation and rest. Unfortunately, you cannot rely on individual transport here, as this, although very convenient, quickly leads to city congestion. A good solution here is properly designed, efficient public transport. However, public transport by itself does not even guarantee good communication, it is important to have adequate changeover options and fast transport to convenient transfer points. It seems that one of the ideas that would be particularly suitable for designing public transport connections is the idea of hub and spoke, developed since the 1970s, then especially in air transport [4].\n\nIt seems that this idea, at least in general terms, will be relatively easy to apply here. In general terms, all fast means of urban transport (metro, fast urban rail, suburban rail, high-speed trams) should be used as a kind of backbone, a structure of connections of high-speed and capacity communication hubs to which commuters are brought, and slower means of transport (buses, ordinary trams) should be used to a large extent to transport people to these communication hubs from other system components.\n\nIn this work we propose the location of such main changeover stations using some aspects of the hub and spoke method by applying a specialized evolutionary algorithm to analyze the actual city transportation system on the basis of publicly available timetable of Warsaw Public Transport vehicles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709273878c28a047395e32","5e70922b878c28a047391019","5e70922b878c28a047391015","5e70922b878c28a047391010"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"296-310","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70920f878c28a04738f539","5e70922b878c28a047391010","5e70922b878c28a047391019","5e709273878c28a047395e32","5e70922b878c28a047391015"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6554a12c4097076913e31d71","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-45069-3","title":"Uncertainty and Imprecision in Decision Making and Decision Support - New Advances, Challenges, and Perspectives: Selected Papers from BOS/SOR-2022, Held on October 13-15, 2022, and IWIFSGN-2022, Held on October 13-14, 2022, in Warsaw, Poland","year":2023,"isbn":"978-3-031-45068-6","issn":"2367-3370","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-45069-3.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"e3d28e45-1617-4a2e-a686-a07f1f41254c","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hub and spoke","evolutionary algorithm","transport system"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059160168"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f257","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Juszczuk","uuid":"032433C246406D352927925C3AA56EE66136A44F21B3330F100FCD55822D851AF8349FC1098A4A203795CFD0ED50C638AEE457DF19B1150D142D1A2888256D77","orcidId":"0000-0001-7893-5410","documentHash":"c35baa05-cf4b-41ae-baae-d69b09906b43"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391008","name":"Lech","lastName":"Kruś","uuid":"6E05C1C089B70D1267D9C5C4C9068BE162D6F265FCEA88D6BDCE28A32E3D6D58F2F57EB7210D3309A80F8EF27203E4744C833B3F69085522DD470EE08F012588","orcidId":"0000-0002-5946-9757","documentHash":"a7ef6154-8502-4338-9523-369edc71f38f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"658eb1d84097071c6f991980","doi":"10.2478/candc-2022-0025","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.2478/candc-2022-0025","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Fuzzy trading system on the forex market for deriving the portfolio of instruments","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Decision support and trading systems for the forex market mostly derive a single signal for the decision-maker. This is so, because instruments are evaluated based on a single criterion, which creates a ranking of instruments, from which the best one is selected. At the same time, one can observe a lack of tools al- lowing one to derive the set of non-dominated trading opportunities considered in the multicriteria space. This article focuses on multicriteria analysis, in which several different market indicators describe a single instrument on the forex market (currency pair), leading to definite criteria. Thus, for a given time horizon, we consider a set of currency pairs described by a group of technical market indicators in every trading session. However, instead of deriving crisp information, based on the buy-no buy binary logic, we use concepts from the fuzzy sets theory, in which each criterion for a single variant takes a value from the h0, 1i interval. We select only the non-dominated variants from such a set, which will be used as elements of the portfolio of currency pairs on the forex market. We test our idea on the real-world data covering more than ten years, several technical market indicators, and over twenty different currency pairs. The preliminary results show that the proposed idea can be treated as a promising concept for deriving a portfolio of currency pairs instead of focusing on only a single currency pair."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391008","5e7092ea878c28a04739f257"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"51","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"467--486","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ea878c28a04739f257","5e70922b878c28a047391008"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479d53","mniswId":"21798","title":"Control and Cybernetics","issn":"0324-8569","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"84bac055-72be-463a-8133-8c8273894d85"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"639c4c7f409707327116b38c","year":"2022","volume":"51","number":"4","documentHash":"eaa77d6c-97d0-46d9-b835-d7f94f041a47"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["trading systems","forex market","fuzzy sets","multicriteria optimization"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059200571"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60e421e29543c723365446a1","name":"Soma","lastName":"Dutta","uuid":"C169C2D7639E668C67A7DFCE84FD01D7BC516584769EAD9E89D75A8A6AEAF026F1B8DFA2F4B00A0B3D04A09C14B4E44F4A2CC22EF60CC5310C21813D3B1B08B3","documentHash":"40fd3907-c136-4246-8fc3-c7d05e4b83b4"},{"objectId":"5e709460878c28a0473bbbab","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Sosnowski","uuid":"EC217826C3BD9E800AC770AAF7ADE389221E20F2AC1F8E13957820A7E9CD930FD81658784A88CEF6276D490CED4BF0FF798350782DBC0179F66E26BB90CBDDBE","documentHash":"95a6e722-9d76-4c3a-905b-ada8f6acfd96"},{"objectId":"5e709352878c28a0473a7475","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Skowron","uuid":"5F1926B596FC713500F3E6B7D9075D38399B5A8382DDA7CD65F7F176BEE2523B3D39BADA38F6A62E5C00027AFA887B23F2F8DC823D59FC8F6BD0A565B1833A9C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5271-6559","documentHash":"feedcacc-b75a-4e42-9ceb-fc9cef69a6f5"}],"objectId":"6594087440970739462ea130","doi":"10.1016/j.ijar.2023.109103","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijar.2023.109103","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Medical decision support in the light of interactive granular computing: Lessons from the Ovufriend project","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The main aim of the paper is to discuss the architecture for the future Intelligent Systems (IS's) and Decision Support Systems (DS's) dealing with complex phenomena such as supporting medical decisions (diagnosis and therapy) and to emphasize challenges in designing such systems. More precisely, the paper presents arguments for developing a specialized computing model based on the interactive granular computing paradigm which can help to design IS's and DS's more close to the prototypes of real life decision making. In this regard, the paper brings to the fore different experiences faced during designing other medical IS's or DS's.As a starting step, the paper considers the experience of developing the OvuFriend platform and outlines some possible extension of it in the framework of the proposed architecture on the basis of Interactive Granular Computing (IGrC) model. Specifically, our attempt is to analyze a scheme, which is being used in the platform of OvuFriend for determining health risks and possibilities of a woman to conceive a child, from the perspective of IGrC. The target of the paper is two fold. Firstly, to show how the underlying AI algorithm of this scheme can be related with the notion of computing in the context of IGrC. Secondly, to identify possible extensions of the existing scheme so that it becomes more dynamic, interactive, and close to personalized medicine."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60e421e29543c723365446a1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709352878c28a0473a7475","5e709460878c28a0473bbbab"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"165","pagesFromTo":"1-13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60e421e29543c723365446a1","5e709352878c28a0473a7475","5e709460878c28a0473bbbab"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478178","mniswId":"8631","title":"International Journal of Approximate Reasoning","issn":"0888-613X","eissn":"1873-4731","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"096dd274-ace4-40b8-bd44-3195b82bcc3c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6594087440970739462ea131","year":"2024","volume":"165","documentHash":"658a2a50-8533-4216-8edd-71d0a131cece"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Interactions","Intelligent system","Medical decision system","(Interactive) granular computing","Complex granule","Informational granule"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059207790"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f54","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Żogała-Siudem","uuid":"190A151D6B37BF612B7F8538114FD1AB6DE75474A52126D5A164E7527A6A7F438D3F56315BB75732F81AF655DE6F3739A62F007A3D9D1854533780A3EB73E29D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2869-7300","documentHash":"5facc6c1-e26c-4637-b563-4069dffcdb46"},{"objectId":"5e709331878c28a0473a4a72","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Jaroszewicz","uuid":"0E4126AE75A4234227C3974394FF9819702DB1FDC2C716B0AB7DAAA1356F9D708C9ADC66B9A5AE41CE377EBCBD664E2ABC4FF55870CF4E53E9741D58B60279BE","orcidId":"0000-0001-9327-5019","documentHash":"777a3f24-80cd-423f-a29b-27c7a7b9271b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"659bba394097076e59fc6ab5","doi":"10.1007/s10618-023-00950-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-023-00950-8","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Variable screening for Lasso based on multidimensional indexing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper we present a correlation based safe screening technique for building the complete Lasso path. Unlike many other Lasso screening approaches we do not consider prespecified values of the regularization parameter, but, instead, prune variables which cannot be the next best feature to be added to the model. Based on those results we present a modified homotopy algorithm for computing the regularization path. We demonstrate that, even though our algorithm provides the complete Lasso path, its performance is competitive with state of the art algorithms which, however, only provide solutions at a prespecified sample of regularization parameters. We also address problems of extremely high dimensionality, where the variables may not fit into main memory and are assumed to be stored on disk. A multidimensional index is used to quickly retrieve potentially relevant variables. We apply the approach to the important case when multiple models are built against a fixed set of variables, frequently encountered in statistical databases. We perform experiments using the complete Eurostat database as predictors and demonstrate that our approach allows for practical and efficient construction of Lasso models, which remain accurate and interpretable even when millions of highly correlated predictors are present."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","uid":"bIPOz_WiDWR0kK88nqXox3A","uuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","name":"Instytut Podstaw Informatyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709331878c28a0473a4a72"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","parentUuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","rootUuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f54"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"38","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"49-78","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f54","5e709331878c28a0473a4a72"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454778fc","mniswId":"4882","title":"Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery","issn":"1384-5810","eissn":"1573-756X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c2b6c711-2d3b-4688-8f12-992c1a50e195"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65cb852c4097072cdd7a2ad2","year":"2023","volume":"38","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"aef7a4ac-dcc8-4b7a-a1b6-4f226e2a2fb7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Variable screening","Lasso","Linear regression","Open data"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059227944"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659bc9584097076e59fdd339","name":"Umberto","lastName":"Viaro","documentHash":"04ebeed0-a477-43f2-914b-bd7c6ed1e082"},{"objectId":"659bc9584097076e59fdd338","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Krajewski","documentHash":"ba5be315-1ce5-49ef-b760-d2351b3fe0f6"},{"objectId":"659bc9584097076e59fdd337","name":"Daniele","lastName":"Casagrande","documentHash":"08aaef86-cdaa-4c1e-9e18-0cdd0c26e0ed"},{"objectId":"659bc9584097076e59fdd336","name":"Hassan Mohamed Abdelalim","lastName":"Abdalla","documentHash":"ce398c32-1cc3-4aa5-a9c4-61f430ea3fe3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-12-21","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"659bc9584097076e59fdd334","doi":"10.1016/j.apnum.2023.12.011","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnum.2023.12.011","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Loewner integer-order approximation of MIMO fractional-order systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A state–space integer–order approximation of commensurate–order systems is obtained using a data–driven interpolation approach based on Loewner matrices. Precisely, given the values of the original fractional–order transfer function at a number of generalised frequencies, a descriptor–form state–space model matching these frequency response values is constructed from a suitable Loewner matrix pencil, as already suggested for the reduction of high–dimensional integer–order systems. Even if the stability of the resulting integer–order system cannot be guaranteed, such an approach is particularly suitable for approximating (infinite–dimensional) fractional–order systems because: (i) the order of the approximation is bounded by half the number of interpolation points, (ii) the procedure is more robust and simple than alternative approximation methods, and (iii) the procedure is fairly flexible and often leads to satisfactory results, as shown by some examples discussed at the end of the article. Clearly, the approximation depends on the location, spacing and number of the generalised interpolation frequencies but there is no particular reason to choose the interpolation frequencies on the imaginary axis, which is a natural choice in integer–order model reduction, since this axis does not correspond to the stability boundary of the original fractional–order system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["659bc9584097076e59fdd338"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"198","pagesFromTo":"112-121","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659bc9584097076e59fdd336","659bc9584097076e59fdd337","659bc9584097076e59fdd338","659bc9584097076e59fdd339"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547713b","mniswId":"1493","title":"Applied Numerical Mathematics","issn":"0168-9274","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"522215a2-2e20-4cb0-be86-8a2fddff9303"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659bc9584097076e59fdd335","year":"2024","volume":"198","documentHash":"1f733819-9876-4daa-9ddf-72bd777c350c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fractional order systems","Loewner matrix","Model approximation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059228207"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739100c","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":"1CF7E7126E77D10B28C94B1E5481F8C55BD4C2F14986D43F46FEEA67F45E681C5FC6DA57EA865A94DF0A21ECA5B4FD8980C09D5B520689EDB30B966581B98FC0","orcidId":"0000-0002-4413-1868","documentHash":"33c3049c-1764-44ae-b468-bc9666bb8f86"}],"objectId":"6597ec0540970755be606a3c","doi":"10.26408/srsp-2023-11","publicUri":"https://ssars.umg.edu.pl/files/srsp-2023/srsp-2023-11.html","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Optimizing repair/replacement policy if cumulative distribution function of time-to-repair is rational function","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A problem of finding the optimal repair/replacement policy of a technical object is under investigation. Depending on the distribution of the time-to-repair and certain cost parameters, a decision is taken whether to repair a failed object or replace it immediately after it fails.

The optimization task consists in formulating the conditions for choosing between immediate replacement and repair, and deriving the analytical equation for the maximum duration of a repair. The objective function is the expected cost of restoring the object to the operating condition. It is assumed that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the time-to-repair is a rational function (a quotient of polynomials).

Based on possible great experience and deep knowledge of the subject, the expert tries to dominate other experts in the decision-making process. Besides, every expert has a possibility of a certain degree to influence on the decision-making process. In such cases experts’ evaluations aggregation into an etalon matrix by the additive or linear aggregation instruments is unacceptable. We present a new two-stage MAGDM approach to solve this task. On the first stage: In the evidence theory environment the connection between experts’ pair interaction indexes and possibility levels of their influence on decision-making process is constructed. For this, a Monte-Carlo simulation algorithm is created, the result of which is the estimated class of associated probabilities of the possibility distribution. Experts’ evaluations in decision-making matrixes are represented by the q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-ROFNs). Before aggregation of experts’ data into an etalon decision-making matrix, evaluations are transformed into discrimination q-rung picture linguistic numbers (q-RPLNs). New definitions are introduced for the Score and Accuracy functions of the q-rung picture linguistic numbers. q-rung picture linguistic numbers contain as well quantitative as qualificative information on experts’ reflections on objects, while discrimination q-rung picture linguistic numbers describe interactive phenomena between arguments. Based on constructed possibility distribution on the experts’ group, the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) and Choquet averaging (CA) aggregation operators under q-rung picture linguistic environment are extended (q-RPLOWA and q-RPLCA, respectively). By the q-RPLOWA and q-RPLCA operators decision-making matrices of experts’ evaluations/ratings are condensed into an etalon decision-making matrix. On the second stage: The concept of Euclidean distance and the entropy of De Luca–Termini are defined for q-rung picture linguistic set. The new relative closeness parameter for the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach under q-rung picture linguistic information is also defined. The technique for the TOPSIS approach for the ranking of possible alternatives in MAGDM by aggregating discrimination q-rung picture linguistic data of etalon matrix is developed. For illustration of the obtained results, Educational Programs Efficiency Evaluation problem is considered. Our constructed MAGDM approach complies with the principle of expertise in educational programs evaluation commission. The numerical results obtained for the q-RPLNs environment and the ranking of alternatives are compared with the numerical results and the ranking of alternatives obtained by the same approach for the initial expert data in q-ROFNs environment. A comparison with the results obtained by other existing methods is given."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391000"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"123","pagesFromTo":"106278","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659d034540970776646acd68","5e70922b878c28a047391000","659d034540970776646acd69","659d034540970776646acd6a","659d034540970776646acd6b","659d034540970776646acd6c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477abd","mniswId":"5708","title":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","issn":"0952-1976","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"19ed2b1b-ccc4-460e-b276-71b61c0ab49b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6531611740970708a2594eca","year":"2023","volume":"123","documentHash":"4862db90-1ac6-45dc-a394-1e2295982422"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059234383"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659c0a9a4097076e59055667","name":"Evgeniya","lastName":"Gerasimenko","documentHash":"a1887e12-bc21-4e43-b5cc-fd39350ef564"},{"objectId":"659c0a9a4097076e59055666","name":"Alexander","lastName":"Bozhenyuk","documentHash":"80a4d48b-5df8-4e04-9c1b-d12a735e2399"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391000","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kacprzyk","uuid":"4A8B2CA444BD6ED60EACF6DE687FF3AF9E95EF07222C91937E5CA1F185E2124FF08DCD7D9A596E8E60911E67B522D3EBFC737B67D6B4294639E916338A719CCB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4187-5877","documentHash":"13701ef2-8325-46ae-a25f-9758ec64477a"}],"objectId":"659c0a9a4097076e59055664","doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2023.110435","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2023.110435","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Lexicographic maximum dynamic evacuation modeling with partial lane reversal based on hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Decision-making under evacuation environment is extremely complex due to the variety of aspects to be considered as well as the necessity of high-speed reaction.

In this regard, the method of finding the priority order of terminals for the evacuation based on the fuzzy hesitant TOPSIS method is proposed. The method handles a modified ranking index to find the priority order based on assigned weights of separations. In this method, experts’ assessments are presented as linguistic terms, which are further converted to fuzzy triangular numbers. This leads to the hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS decision-making with completely unknown attribute weights.\n\nThe existing state of the art of evacuation modeling lacks fuzzy statements of evacuation flow problems. Our work aims to contribute to the design of the algorithm for the lexicographic maximum flow finding in the evacuation dynamic network with fuzzy transit arc capacities and transit traversal time parameters with partial contraflow. The approach reverses only necessary arcs by reversing the traffic in vacant segments, which allows using these segments for movement towards the safe areas as well. In addition, the method based on linear combinations of spreads is proposed to handle fuzzy values, which does not lead to the blurring of a fuzzy number. A case study to find the priority order of four destinations along with the maximum dynamic flow determining is provided to illustrate the proposed method. The hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS evaluated the priority order of destinations for evacuation the maximum number of aggrieved as along with maximum lexicographic flow with partial lane reversal flow units. The method for finding the spreads without blurring a fuzzy number was used to determine the final triangular number (50, 62, 75) units.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis shows that in all ten cases, the alternatives have unique rank:is the best, is the worst. In the pessimistic case, DMs prefers the alternative that is furthest to FNIS. In the optimistic case, DMs prefer the alternative that is closest to FPIS. We proved that the proposed algorithm is reliable because despite the changes in parameters , the same priority order of alternatives is chosen. The obtained results are confirmed by efficiency frontier and coincide with the results of original TOPSIS, Doukas et al.’s, method, Kuo’s method, Yoon and Kim’s behavioral TOPSIS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391000"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"144","pagesFromTo":"1-18","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a047391000","659c0a9a4097076e59055666","659c0a9a4097076e59055667"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477150","mniswId":"1519","title":"Applied Soft Computing Journal","issn":"1568-4946","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"890e228a-57d2-4fd2-951d-0b511604feff"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659c0b354097076e590574df","year":"2023","volume":"144","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"322f56ef-18b7-4811-a4c4-e98a36527178"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Multi-attribute group decision-making","Hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS","Linguistic assessments","Lexicographic maximum dynamic flow","Fuzzy networks","Partial lane reversal"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059234770"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b7889","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Bujnowski","uuid":"BA8978A42FC9B8F884FB0D3427D0920D5FCB19FDFF944F32AC7F4107243DFD1BE96ADADBE3288ED7B2FA06FB4D9C60E15A869A3E336198B558118747F537AFA4","documentHash":"0a2e4275-0045-4b34-ae76-d83f035d307a"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739101c","name":"Eulalia","lastName":"Szmidt","uuid":"ABEBC015C9857F48F7BB0A5F57E80DE8BB665A74A933467463BA3762CD2C1CA967415FAC13F7C606903BE95E8415A9E70EA8925B0EEBD99D1136E79249EAA80A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2192-6905","documentHash":"34baa502-c0bb-49c8-be93-804df5f518fa"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391000","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kacprzyk","uuid":"4A8B2CA444BD6ED60EACF6DE687FF3AF9E95EF07222C91937E5CA1F185E2124FF08DCD7D9A596E8E60911E67B522D3EBFC737B67D6B4294639E916338A719CCB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4187-5877","documentHash":"13701ef2-8325-46ae-a25f-9758ec64477a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2023-06-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"659d96ff40970776647a49f1","doi":"10.7546/nifs.2023.29.2.144-156","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.7546/nifs.2023.29.2.144-156","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Identification of a sufficient number of the best attributes in the intuitionistic fuzzy models","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Dimension reduction of the models, i.e., pointing out only the necessary number of input variables (attributes, features) is an important task enabling the efficient performance of different algorithms.

This paper is a step toward developing the foundations of such IS’s. The decisions of IS’s are constructed along the reasoning performed by complex granules (c-granules) which are responsible for creating interfaces between informational layers and physical layers of IS’s, often synchronized or learnt from the reasoning performed by humans. Depending on applications, the decisions may take different forms, e.g.: compound decisions represented by the collections of decisions made in a given period of time, specifications of compound structural physical objects satisfying the wanted properties, (parameterized) learning algorithms generating high quality classifiers from samples of objects, pipelines of computations preserving some given constraints, etc. Both the construction of compound decisions and reasoning are performed over information perceived by means of c-granules used by IS’s as interfaces for interactions with the physical world. Such interactions of c-granules are realized by the control layer (control, in short) of these granules.

We extend first this formulation by context exemplified by “find houses which are inexpensive and – if possible, with respect to other houses in town – are possibly close to public transportation”. We use a logical representation of the “and, if possible...” operator but also mention some other ones, notably based on the winnow operator. Moreover, we present a new formulation of a contextual bipolar query, “find a house which is inexpensive or - if impossible, with respect to other houses in own – is new”.

In this context, employees with process thinking competency are particularly valuable for each organization, as it facilitates understanding the ecosystem in which the organization operates. , eliminates the silos of the organization, identifies bottlenecks,  increases the efficiency of processes, as well as improves communication thanks to understanding the interdependence of commonly performed processes. Preparing new generations of employees equipped with process thinking competency is the task of the education system, in particular higher education institutions. However, while project thinking is already well integrated into study curricula, process thinking rarely appears as one of the key skills and intended learning outcomes. The aim of the article is to present a possible approach to developing students' process thinking, which is a prerequisite for further education in the field of business process management. The article presents a case study on the use of Living Labs as extracurricular activities aimed at immersing students in the process of mapping, design, analyzing, and improving the processes that concern them, which translates into increasing their engagement and sharing their ideas, experiences, and knowledge of the used products, services, or applications. The Living Lab is defined as a user-centric innovation environment built on daily practice and research, with an approach to facilitating user influence in open and distributed innovation processes, involving all relevant partners in real-world contexts, aimed at creating sustainable value. This approach is widely used in industry, sustainable development, designing services for local communities etc. This method, with a great potential to introduce students to the subject of process management and development of competences set in this area, is, however, used to a small extent in higher education. Therefore, based on the case study, the authors make recommendations for instructional strategies using living labs in business process management education."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","5e709479878c28a0473bde28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574186e","mniswId":"862","fullName":"International Business Information Management","shortName":"IBIMA","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"6029aca7-ff4d-42fd-9ba3-6932a546725d"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"65a5144b4097071df01f934a","startDate":"2023-11-29","endDate":"2023-11-30","fullName":"42nd International Business Information Management Conference","shortName":"42nd IBIMA Conference","city":"Seville","country":"ES","website":"https://ibima.org/current-conferences/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"c560a6fc-5f99-4621-863a-5a5331eed8bd"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"65a5144b4097071df01f9349","title":"Proceedings of the 42nd International Business Information Management Conference (IBIMA)","year":2023,"translation":false,"documentHash":"9c1475a4-bd86-4d51-8884-3132f849be1d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["process thinking","business process management","living labs","instructional strategies","case study"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059262321"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65a66609409707136ff9f19b","name":"Pavel I.","lastName":"Plotnikov","documentHash":"0d736a0e-9f94-45d5-b1cc-3ff677a78861"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396dab","name":"Jan","lastName":"Sokołowski","uuid":"D86F76C962EA4F52C42EC0E2867AFE870286266A7B8FACAAA324F869A573E8589798B0DD2700B73686277707B16BBD81D2D84C00FEE9C0AA49AAB989F7376D7A","documentHash":"8831a331-385f-4d75-bf78-45626a80b1b0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"65a66609409707136ff9f199","doi":"10.1007/s12220-023-01252-7","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12220-023-01252-7","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Geometric Aspects of Shape Optimization","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present a review of known results in shape optimization from the point of view of Geometric Analysis. This paper is devoted to the mathematical aspects of the shape optimization theory. We focus on the theory of gradient flows of objective functions and their regularizations. Shape optimization is a part of calculus of variations which uses the geometry. Shape optimization is also related to the free boundary problems in the theory of Partial Differential Equations. We consider smooth perturbations of geometrical domains in order to develop the shape calculus for the analysis of shape optimization problems. There are many applications of such a framework, in solid and fluid mechanics as well as in the solution of inverse problems. For the sake of simplicity we consider model problems, in principle in two spatial dimensions. However, the methods presented are used as well in three spatial dimensions. We present a result on the convergence of the shape gradient method for a model problem. To our best knowledge it is the first result of convergence in shape optimization. The complete proofs of some results are presented in report (Plotnikov and Sokolowski, Gradient flow for Kohn–Vogelius functional)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396dab"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1-57","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65a66609409707136ff9f19b","5e709281878c28a047396dab"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547872b","mniswId":"11221","title":"Journal of Geometric Analysis","issn":"1050-6926","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"a827d036-558f-4527-be72-fba41196dc15"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a66683409707136ff9fee5","year":"2023","volume":"33","number":"7","doi":"","documentHash":"600edadb-17e9-42a4-86bc-adab5fafaeb2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059266452"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659be6004097076e59013d55","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Zwierzchowski","documentHash":"39a40b84-fd57-4902-97a0-7c713394ec85"},{"objectId":"659be6004097076e59013d54","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Kozakiewicz","documentHash":"c17c08fd-df97-41ce-a072-e7b6406dc2bf"},{"objectId":"659be6004097076e59013d53","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jastrzębska","documentHash":"c7d8de4d-21cd-457f-aa80-dd9c41b73bc9"},{"objectId":"659be6004097076e59013d52","name":"Marek","lastName":"Gajewski","documentHash":"be1704dc-3282-478f-a177-0810060b88fb"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396bdb","name":"Karol","lastName":"Opara","uuid":"87EA036EA878A3AF690AA68ABBFA11F814645A1247FFEE0B145260F08486915D7264FB23206CE77E5E6D69ECB2F29E02A2B4BB26CF4FD8848EF1B2FB50A5D1E1","orcidId":"0000-0002-7149-4031","documentHash":"3748c6a9-f884-4526-9816-34166251ebc1"},{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a0473918ef","name":"Olgierd","lastName":"Hryniewicz","uuid":"23CA97097CFB2D4AE572AAAD298CF7D5C0E3B9E7F70A97CA42ACBF81FB08322FF66C6A1C4DCA4000A87FF30E939C331D34E304519A57C48CAAE3E4838824ADFC","orcidId":"0000-0001-9877-508X","documentHash":"2c39abe5-e8b1-49fa-8939-1907610180dc"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739101f","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Zadrożny","uuid":"C34AE9CE91E6A1B4C123DDE8FEA58BD66D2144E8AD5551ED1D54D774E4A2E152FA2ADDBF74E3FB1377E7B6BBD67255F2566A7E10A1E4194429AEDCFFD702F891","orcidId":"0000-0002-6642-0927","documentHash":"bb76266c-0da9-4d75-83ef-53badcb12c83"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391010","name":"Jan","lastName":"Owsiński","uuid":"416042265B06410CDDA6F2A0342AF1B0372F802B33CCC88EB6873B5E8CE78AFB1F9CCAA7D953998E4EB364B2E5BA21FE72EE64265D7AA153D6CD0EE725F588B4","documentHash":"e6f64468-5cbe-471d-b233-d312af71f8f3"}],"objectId":"659be6004097076e59013d51","doi":"10.1007/978-981-19-8094-7_37","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-8094-7_37","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"On Ups and Downs in Analyzing Web Activity Data: Notes from a Project","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Analyzing data from the web is now one of the primary tasks, understood in a variety of manners and solved for a very wide variety of purposes.

In the case of single additive errors, bit insertion/dropping can occur in the outputs of demodulators which implies long error packets which are hard to correct. To provide highly reliable data transmission, parameters of bit errors exemplified by the length of insertion/dropping and position of bits have to be evaluated but widely used methods for detecting and evaluating bit errors do not yield such parameters. In this paper, two new methods are proposed as a solution to this problem for the estimation of bit error parameters under single additive errors in which the difference between two positions of clock elements in the reference sequence and the received pseudorandom sequence is calculated. The new method, in addition to algorithmic effectiveness and efficiency, makes it also possible to reduce the hardware complexity of devices to be implemented for detecting and estimating the bit error parameters. Specifically, when implemented on a specialized programmable signal processor the new approach yields the computational complexity as ∼200 + 27 T clock cycles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391000"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"624","pagesFromTo":"652-673","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659d5b1d4097077664755ed1","659d5b1d4097077664755ed2","659d5b1d4097077664755ed3","659d5b1d4097077664755ed4","659d5b1d4097077664755ed5","659d5b1d4097077664755ed6","5e70922b878c28a047391000"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d5","mniswId":"8327","title":"Information Sciences","issn":"0020-0255","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4163795f-444a-41b6-b172-a0bdb2570867"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659d5b1d4097077664755ed0","year":"2023","volume":"624","documentHash":"9f9fdf3f-b7c7-4994-b396-47f1843466f8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059280018"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65abca67409707191d28b5c8","name":"Xinli","lastName":"Shi","documentHash":"717f824b-6d1c-4eff-89b2-6e995c56feb2"},{"objectId":"65abca67409707191d28b5c7","name":"Jinde","lastName":"Cao","documentHash":"03722d73-e050-4d03-8baf-45bf40c5064c"},{"objectId":"65abca67409707191d28b5c6","name":"Wanjie","lastName":"Zhu","documentHash":"dcb63ada-3c6d-4ce2-b460-79eb74264a9e"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e75e","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"A56F3A8C2F6246587B88982FE48FEA2855A7B5222539A126265F1D882510368FD87B8932975E7451D01686982B7D3158DA885EF3F5FFA39E4B9D9EE6FD22470F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6960-9525","documentHash":"715a0529-c457-4823-a66d-ee6bebb7dd83"}],"objectId":"65abca67409707191d28b5c5","doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2023.119486","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2023.119486","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Leader-following consensus of finite-field networks with time-delays","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we investigate the leader-following consensus problem for high-ordered finite-field networks (FFNs) with time-delays.

In the present paper, we generate for the first time new microstructures featuring these effects from topological optimization of two-dimensional periodic media.

The optimization method applied here relies on the recently rigorously derived topological derivative of the second-order homogenized tensor, measuring the strain-gradient sensitivity with respect to a small circular inclusion at the microscopic level endowed with different material property from the background. This previous theoretical work allows an accurate numerical implementation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396dab"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"100","pagesFromTo":"1-16","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65a668ba409707136ffa25d0","65a668ba409707136ffa25d1","65a668ba409707136ffa25d2","5e709281878c28a047396dab"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477bc7","mniswId":"6210","title":"European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids","issn":"0997-7538","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"da4e3685-bf2d-4ae9-9aee-c04f93fb93b5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a668ba409707136ffa25cf","year":"2023","volume":"100","documentHash":"c55f710e-a50f-4eb3-af69-84d4f7da2e39"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Topological optimization","Higher-order homogenization","Strain-gradient continuum","Architectured materials","Periodic homogenization"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059300894"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65a7bc364097071e0b89cb69","name":"Louis","lastName":"Tebou","documentHash":"298e70da-efcd-425f-8e8b-67eab4a17056"},{"objectId":"5e70927d878c28a0473968d6","name":"Irena","lastName":"Lasiecka","uuid":"47F509CBE165D4E33E902D196B18DC69D08D7583661F835B89CE9F5D765BB359C047ACF1A2F687E839A4055EDAB4DD4E109FD9ED5CE94984674A4F6D03DAE558","orcidId":"0000-0003-3342-2202","documentHash":"dba59164-8080-4f05-9fb9-fb054956c368"}],"objectId":"65a7bc364097071e0b89cb67","doi":"10.3934/dcds.2024004","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/dcds.2024004","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Gevrey regularity of the semigroup corresponding to an Euler-Bernoulli plate equation with localized structural damping","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We consider a structurally damped Euler-Bernoulli plate equation in a bounded domain.

The complex structure of the pheromone is supposed to increase ants’ awareness when choosing the next edge of the graph, helping them achieve better results than in the original algorithm.

Obtaining of the estimates requires an optimal solution of a discrete programming problem which minimizes sum of differences between relation form and comparisons. The problem is NP hard and can be solved with the use of exact algorithms for moderate size of sets, i.e. below 100 elements. In the case of larger sets, i.e. at least 200–300 comparisons for each element, it is necessary to apply heuristic algorithms. The paper presents the results, which allow determining of optimal or suboptimal solution with acceptable computational cost. They include: statistical procedure and test producing “new” comparisons with low probabilities of errors; the comparisons provides efficiency of heuristic algorithms.

We consider both necessary and sufficient conditions of the second-order which differ by the strengthening of inequalities in their formulations. The conditions use first and second order approximations (first and second-order tangents) of the set K. The no gap sufficient conditions need additional assumptions in comparison with necessary conditions. We show that these assumptions hold true in the case when the set K is an intersection of a finite number of sets described by smooth inequalities and equalities, like in problems of the mathematical programming. Moreover, we illustrate the new conditions by deducing some mathematical programming results. In this sense the paper is partly a survey. One non-trivial illustrative example in an infinite dimensional space concerns the case when K can not be represented as an intersection described above. The novelty of our approach is due, on one hand, to the arbitrariness of the set K, and on the other hand, to quite straightforward proofs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709288878c28a047397664"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"529","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"1-34","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65cc980a4097073ccbc619cb","5e709288878c28a047397664"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478857","mniswId":"11769","title":"Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications","issn":"0022-247X","eissn":"1096-0813","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"7419b899-3ecb-4280-b1c2-d1b84888d342"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65cc980a4097073ccbc619ca","year":"2024","volume":"529","number":"2","documentHash":"28bc7638-1ec5-42d8-b3d8-bab978455402"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lagrange function","First and second order tangents","Second order optimality conditions","Local minimum","Equality and inequality constraints","Separation theorem"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059373800"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ca","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"CHUDZIKIEWICZ","uuid":"3734C1F8A0F0E9E049FB7288CDF812649179785BB15F477B4CE7FD59F257EFA5D69AF380AD051CF48A66ED931513679A18AD988D6A7EF32A59B9DF946E51878C","orcidId":"0000-0003-4767-4056","documentHash":"dda00acd-0768-45db-b0d0-b901dc3d3119"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b56","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Myśliński","uuid":"9C83A6F063FE2F720C598B9D6282690E1CA207C9AB0E4641DA3BDE6AFF4B49ABECFA96140FFED392345738558E0A1A081106E89DDBCB02EEC141F95294EAA7A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0909-3114","documentHash":"267fab46-c039-4419-9a82-95284b2ada39"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65cf2af14097075ea841075a","doi":"10.3390/app14010165","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/app14010165","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Power Dissipation and Wear Modeling in Wheel–Rail Contact","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper is concerned with the modeling of power dissipation due to friction and its relation with wear estimation in wheel–rail contact. Wear is a complex multi-scale and multi-physical phenomenon appearing in rolling contact. Wear is generated by high contact stress and the work of friction forces. This phenomenon leads to the appearing of the worn material in the form of wear debris between contacting surfaces. In contact models, wear is usually described in terms of the wear depth function. This function modifies the gap between the contacting bodies as well as the shape of the surfaces of the wheel and rail in contact. In this paper, besides the wear depth function, the dissipated energy, rather than the contact stress, is taken into account to evaluate the wear impact on rail or wheel surfaces. The dissipated energy allows us to more precisely evaluate the wear debris amount as well as the depth of wear and its distribution along the contact interface. A two-dimensional rolling contact problem with frictional heat flow is considered. The elasto-plastic deformation of the rail is considered. This contact problem is governed by a coupled system of mechanical and thermal equations in terms of generalized stresses, displacement and temperature. The finite element method is used to discretize this problem. A discretized system of equations with nonpenetration and friction conditions is transformed and formulated as a nonlinear complementarity problem. The generalized Newton method is applied to numerically solve this mechanical subproblem. The Cholesky method is used to find the solution of the heat-conductive problem. The dissipated power is evaluated based on the resultant force and slip at a reference point. Numerical results including the distribution of slip velocity, power factor and wear rate are provided and discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927e878c28a047396b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

The purpose is to investigate whether BPMS remains pertinent in the face of increasingly complex and diverse business processes, considering the overlapping functionalities with ERP systems.  Design/methodology/approach: This discussion paper employs a systematic theoretical literature review approach. The methodology integrates insights from existing research, conducting comprehensive searches across reputable academic databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Keyword searches yielded over 500 results, which were refined to 203 relevant articles through prioritizing peer-reviewed sources. The synthesis of literature includes an analysis of historical evolution and  a comparative study of critical success factors, forming the basis for deriving potential future trajectories for these interconnected system classes, and emphasizing their strategic alignment. Findings: This discussion paper presents an overview of the current state and future development trajectory of the two critical information systems (IS) classes for modern organizational management—ERP and BPMS—and compares the critical success factors (CSFs) associated with each system class. Based on this comparison, the paper determines the development direction of both system classes concerning business requirements. Originality/value: Unlike prior literature which has examined ERP and BPMS systems individually, this study provides original perspectives by conducting a direct comparative analysis of the critical success factors for each system class. The comparative CSF analysis approach enables this study to contribute unique insights into the status and future trajectory of ERP and BPMS systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a640f"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"185","pagesFromTo":"481-510","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","65ce028e4097074ca0bb69c2","5e709347878c28a0473a640f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547a747","mniswId":"200171","title":"Zeszyty Naukowe Politechniki Śląskiej.

Despite the increasing number of studies attempting to assess organisational process maturity, it is important to highlight the discourse in foreign subject literature regarding a critical perspective on maturity models. This primarily concerns the utilitarian aspect, which is identified as the limited practical value of applying maturity models. The main objective of this article is to evaluate the current state of knowledge on business process management (BPM) maturity in Polish and foreign subject literature, and to outline directions for further research on process maturity, with a special focus on new requirements and opportunities arising from Industry 4.0 and the emerging Industry 5.0. In order to achieve this objective, research methods such as bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review were applied.

With this consideration in mind the paper presents a critical and comprehensive analysis of recent developments, trends and challenges of Flexible Query Answering Systems (FQASs). Flexible query answering is a multidisciplinary research field that is not limited to question answering in natural language, but comprises other query forms and interaction modalities, which aim to provide powerful means and techniques for better reflecting human preferences and intentions to retrieve relevant information. It adopts methods at the crossroad of several disciplines among which Information Retrieval (IR), databases, knowledge based systems, knowledge and data engineering, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the semantic web may be mentioned. The analysis principles are inspired by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) framework, characterized by a top-down process, starting with relevant keywords for the topic of interest to retrieve relevant articles from meta-sources And complementing these articles with other relevant articles from seed sources Identified by a bottom-up process. to mine the retrieved publication data a network analysis is performed Which allows to present in a synthetic way intrinsic topics of the selected publications. issues dealt with are related to query answering methods Both model-based and data-driven (the latter based on either machine learning or deep learning) And to their needs for explainability and fairness to deal with big data Notably by taking into account data veracity. conclusions point out trends and challenges to help better shaping the future of the FQAS field."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a04739101f","5e70922b878c28a047391000"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"149","pagesFromTo":"1-19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66262ff44097071fab4aff0d","66262ff44097071fab4aff0e","66262ff44097071fab4aff0f","5e70922b878c28a047391000","66262ff44097071fab4aff10","5e70922b878c28a04739101f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454778fa","mniswId":"4880","title":"Data and Knowledge Engineering","issn":"0169-023X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2a21525c-2ed6-4094-97e2-dfdd869b4df6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66262ff44097071fab4aff0c","year":"2024","volume":"149","documentHash":"4834abbe-9a20-491f-9e3b-f49ba8178b4b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Flexible query answering","Model-based query answering","Data-driven query answering"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059568447"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667ea966fdbe836b519b6412","name":"Quoc Bao","lastName":"Vo","documentHash":"504af1b9-3606-4eb7-9cb2-bc1be5cf8991"},{"objectId":"667ea966fdbe836b519b6411","name":"Rachael","lastName":"McDonald","documentHash":"449cccea-4078-49ae-899f-c4ff1d982435"},{"objectId":"667ea966fdbe836b519b6410","name":"Gavin","lastName":"Lambert","documentHash":"d22a75b3-d611-4931-a53d-6808aa9b8386"},{"objectId":"667ea966fdbe836b519b640f","name":"Minyi","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"fe47c87d-1e1f-47ef-9dd3-0d7fb1b7c270"},{"objectId":"667ea966fdbe836b519b640e","name":"Duy-Anh","lastName":"Nguyen","documentHash":"b4d70de9-c620-4f97-ab04-0b47bffdd708"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b824f","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"C34B5BD166A72CFDCC0BB81F0FDB001A2EDE06564A6A420DB551E449F90B32FE4A6FB188EDBECD9DF6A835B4137D2D211C3B8ED329F77D14EF31C15B1A21C073","documentHash":"08e43a2c-24f1-478e-8cb2-5570dec5908f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"667ea966fdbe836b519b640c","doi":"10.2196/52482","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/52482","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Efficient Machine Reading Comprehension for Health Care Applications: Algorithm Development and Validation of a Context Extraction Approach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Extractive methods for machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks have achieved comparable or better accuracy than human performance on benchmark data sets. However, such models are not as successful when adapted to complex domains such as health care. One of the main reasons is that the context that the MRC model needs to process when operating in a complex domain can be much larger compared with an average open-domain context. This causes the MRC model to make less accurate and slower predictions. A potential solution to this problem is to reduce the input context of the MRC model by extracting only the necessary parts from the original context.\n\nObjective: This study aims to develop a method for extracting useful contexts from long articles as an additional component to the question answering task, enabling the MRC model to work more efficiently and accurately.\n\nMethods: Existing approaches to context extraction in MRC are based on sentence selection strategies, in which the models are trained to find the sentences containing the answer. We found that using only the sentences containing the answer was insufficient for the MRC model to predict correctly. We conducted a series of empirical studies and observed a strong relationship between the usefulness of the context and the confidence score output of the MRC model. Our investigation showed that a precise input context can boost the prediction correctness of the MRC and greatly reduce inference time. We proposed a method to estimate the utility of each sentence in a context in answering the question and then extract a new, shorter context according to these estimations. We generated a data set to train 2 models for estimating sentence utility, based on which we selected more precise contexts that improved the MRC model’s performance.\n\nResults: We demonstrated our approach on the Question Answering Data Set for COVID-19 and Biomedical Semantic Indexing and Question Answering data sets and showed that the approach benefits the downstream MRC model. First, the method substantially reduced the inference time of the entire question answering system by 6 to 7 times. Second, our approach helped the MRC model predict the answer more correctly compared with using the original context (F1-score increased from 0.724 to 0.744 for the Question Answering Data Set for COVID-19 and from 0.651 to 0.704 for the Biomedical Semantic Indexing and Question Answering). We also found a potential problem where extractive transformer MRC models predict poorly despite being given a more precise context in some cases.\n\nConclusions: The proposed context extraction method allows the MRC model to achieve improved prediction correctness and a significantly reduced MRC inference time. This approach works technically with any MRC model and has potential in tasks involving processing long texts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709434878c28a0473b824f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","pagesFromTo":"1-14","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["667ea966fdbe836b519b640e","667ea966fdbe836b519b640f","667ea966fdbe836b519b6410","5e709434878c28a0473b824f","667ea966fdbe836b519b6411","667ea966fdbe836b519b6412"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850cc6a","mniswId":"29702","title":"JMIR Formative Research","eissn":"2561-326X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"dd68ce86-a6c0-4cc2-b42f-144a5b00d4d2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"667ea966fdbe836b519b640d","year":"2024","volume":"8","documentHash":"02da730a-c041-4cbf-8f58-ab8141f64c2e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["question answering","machine reading comprehension","context extraction","covid19","health care"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059665703"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667e92c9fdbe836b519a6170","name":"Zehong","lastName":"Cao","documentHash":"dd2c6d0f-0e7a-4fb9-80e7-db5fa974c140"},{"objectId":"667e92c9fdbe836b519a616f","name":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Mayer","documentHash":"3411ea04-9d5c-453b-bb76-0ca48c3eb25a"},{"objectId":"667e92c9fdbe836b519a616e","name":"Sunu","lastName":"Wibirama","documentHash":"036c456b-79df-40fd-b02a-df3697fc226e"},{"objectId":"667e92c9fdbe836b519a616d","name":"Mahardhika","lastName":"Pratama","documentHash":"97b99f76-0b52-4b81-98b7-f1f58f23777d"},{"objectId":"667e92c9fdbe836b519a616c","name":"Naeem","lastName":"Paeedeh","documentHash":"bcfbcc64-ce33-4253-ba08-ff11c5b64abf"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b824f","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"C34B5BD166A72CFDCC0BB81F0FDB001A2EDE06564A6A420DB551E449F90B32FE4A6FB188EDBECD9DF6A835B4137D2D211C3B8ED329F77D14EF31C15B1A21C073","documentHash":"08e43a2c-24f1-478e-8cb2-5570dec5908f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"667e92c9fdbe836b519a616a","doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2024.120751","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2024.120751","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Few-shot class incremental learning via robust transformer approach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL)presents an extension of the Class Incremental Learning (CIL)problem where a model is faced with the problem of data scarcity while addressing the Catastrophic Forgetting (CF)problem. This problem remains an open problem because all recent works are built upon the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)performing sub-optimally compared to the transformer approaches. Our paper presents Robust Transformer Approach (ROBUSTA)built upon the Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT). The issue of overfitting due to few samples is overcome with the notion of the stochastic classifier, where the classifier's weights are sampled from a distribution with mean and variance vectors, thus increasing the likelihood of correct classifications, and the batch-norm layer to stabilize the training process. The issue of CFis dealt with the idea of delta parameters, small task-specific trainable parameters while keeping the backbone networks frozen. A non-parametric approach is developed to infer the delta parameters for the model's predictions. The prototype rectification approach is applied to avoid biased prototype calculations due to the issue of data scarcity. The advantage of ROBUSTAis demonstrated through a series of experiments in the benchmark problems where it is capable of outperforming prior arts with big margins without any data augmentation protocols."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709434878c28a0473b824f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"675","pagesFromTo":"1-21","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["667e92c9fdbe836b519a616c","667e92c9fdbe836b519a616d","667e92c9fdbe836b519a616e","667e92c9fdbe836b519a616f","667e92c9fdbe836b519a6170","5e709434878c28a0473b824f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d5","mniswId":"8327","title":"Information Sciences","issn":"0020-0255","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4163795f-444a-41b6-b172-a0bdb2570867"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"667e92c9fdbe836b519a616b","year":"2024","volume":"675","documentHash":"a1c4bfbd-6569-4dad-bc72-c86e0d96a14e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Continual learning","Class incremental learning","Few-shot class-incremental learning","Few-shot learning"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059666059"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6687d27bfdbe835901204f74","name":"Zoriana","lastName":"Romanchuk","documentHash":"be9a9f25-3868-48b2-8a23-336c68a5d264"},{"objectId":"6687d27bfdbe835901204f73","name":"Orysia","lastName":"Yashchun","documentHash":"c1f00010-e9d8-4517-86bf-edd197c8d2c2"},{"objectId":"6687d27bfdbe835901204f72","name":"Iolanda","lastName":"Ialongo","documentHash":"e2b44017-f538-4ad8-85a2-68442f4bf4bd"},{"objectId":"6687d27bfdbe835901204f71","name":"Vasyl","lastName":"Kovalyshyn","documentHash":"2fac8dd6-6c94-4483-bf09-279c6e60b0a9"},{"objectId":"6687d27bfdbe835901204f70","name":"Mathias","lastName":"Jonas","documentHash":"aa3a3a9c-4e64-471c-b23a-8e689534ae17"},{"objectId":"6687d27bfdbe835901204f6f","name":"Enrique","lastName":"Puliafito","documentHash":"04fae8cf-ab13-4c7f-aca1-5bf65bc80119"},{"objectId":"6687d27bfdbe835901204f6e","name":"Linda","lastName":"See","documentHash":"c028b6fe-2d05-4461-9946-bf4d904befd1"},{"objectId":"6687d27bfdbe835901204f6d","name":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Oda","documentHash":"9f7925ed-571c-4c3d-8efd-95099333fd8f"},{"objectId":"6687d27bfdbe835901204f6c","name":"Gregg","lastName":"Marland","documentHash":"35d5573b-b7d0-4bf3-9e40-098f28daf763"},{"objectId":"6687d27bfdbe835901204f6b","name":"Rostyslav","lastName":"Bun","documentHash":"1671f2b1-0739-4f3f-99e2-bdff88aafef2"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739100e","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Nahorski","uuid":"1EF2B08D468D1EF6CA5ABE8126DCD17798EB839E7274A8A4BC24B463FB0BE117628EDF6056801D65239486B31E9BDA80234841E215F38754E9F3EB67B689D6C0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2340-8020","documentHash":"9de9252a-2092-4211-92b7-73f2c543d376"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-03-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"6687d27bfdbe835901204f6a","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.169879","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.169879","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Tracking unaccounted greenhouse gas emissions due to the war in Ukraine since 2022","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Accounting and reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are mandatory for Parties under the Paris Agreement. Emissions reporting is important for understanding the global carbon cycle and for addressing global climate change. However, in a period of open conflict or war, military emissions increase significantly and the accounting system is not currently designed to account adequately for this source. In this paper we analyze how, during the first 18 months of the 2022/2023 full-scale war in Ukraine, GHG national inventory reporting to the UNFCCC was affected. We estimated the decrease of emissions due to a reduction in traditional human activities. We identified major, war-related, emission processes from the territory of Ukraine not covered by current GHG inventory guidelines and that are not likely to be included in national inventory reports. If these emissions are included, they will likely be incorporated in a way that is not transparent with potentially high uncertainty. We analyze publicly available data and use expert judgment to estimate such emissions from (1) the use of bombs, missiles, barrel artillery, and mines; (2) the consumption of oil products for military operations; (3) fires at petroleum storage depots and refineries; (4) fires in buildings and infrastructure facilities; (5) fires on forest and agricultural lands; and (6) the decomposition of war-related garbage/waste. Our estimate of these war-related emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide for the first 18 months of the war in Ukraine is 77 MtCO2-eq. with a relative uncertainty of +/−22 % (95 % confidence interval)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a04739100e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"914","pagesFromTo":"1-15","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6687d27bfdbe835901204f6b","6687d27bfdbe835901204f6c","6687d27bfdbe835901204f6d","6687d27bfdbe835901204f6e","6687d27bfdbe835901204f6f","5e70922b878c28a04739100e","6687d27bfdbe835901204f70","6687d27bfdbe835901204f71","6687d27bfdbe835901204f72","6687d27bfdbe835901204f73","6687d27bfdbe835901204f74"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"59516ca8-3554-4f06-a1d4-f330ee71985e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a131f84097071121a78630","year":"2024","volume":"914","documentHash":"9da271a3-92c0-4d7f-b7af-e21cd87c8622"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Wartime GHG emissions","GHG emission reporting","Unreported GHG emissions","Uncertainty in GHG emissions","War in Ukraine"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059685118"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66b0a730fdbe8305356e0b5f","name":"Henna","lastName":"Malinen","documentHash":"7ebb0767-4a3b-43c0-8729-a8738f710fb5"},{"objectId":"66b0a730fdbe8305356e0b5e","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Suomalainen","documentHash":"e157a5d9-7175-44c3-a54c-3ab0d9c34286"},{"objectId":"5e709287878c28a04739745b","name":"Marko","lastName":"Tainio","uuid":"BFC9AB4AC22507AC78C89C6C8BA2B7C99504181EBAF63A66546128D3157D2FDF4BDF97EEBB392A2E517A546F28F08667BF30054185EFFE864EC77981CCCA4572","documentHash":"7de99cdf-ecb6-40bb-aa10-d3e04202bc4b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"66b0a730fdbe8305356e0b5b","doi":"10.1016/j.jcmr.2024.100034","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmr.2024.100034","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Modelling cycling to school in Finland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Active travel to school is an important contributor to the physical activity levels of children and adolescents and the source of many health benefits. In this work, we model cycling to school in Finland. The probability to cycle on a given trip is modelled using a binary logistic regression model based on trip length, average route gradient, the cyclist’s gender, and age. Variables denoting the city regions were also included to account for differences in cycling cultures and infrastructure. In addition, weather variables were added as cycling levels in Finland are highly dependent on the season. Air temperature and the presence of snow were found to reflect well the observed seasonal variations. The observed influence of winter conditions on trip distances and the cycling of girls is also replicated in the model through interaction terms. This model is employed to explore two sustainable mobility scenarios: a scenario where the cycling of girls increases to the same level as that of boys and a scenario where all school children cycle as much as those living in Oulu, Finland’s top cycling region. Our results suggest that it would be possible to increase the number of trips by bicycle and cycled mileage significantly, up to 76 % in the Oulu scenario, even though school children already cycle much more than the general population."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709287878c28a04739745b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66b0a730fdbe8305356e0b5e","66b0a730fdbe8305356e0b5f","5e709287878c28a04739745b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"66b0a730fdbe8305356e0b5c","title":"Journal of Cycling and Micromobility Research","eissn":"2950-1059","websiteLink":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-cycling-and-micromobility-research","documentHash":"424f0930-2d29-4694-9327-754e5cbc2218"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b0a730fdbe8305356e0b5d","year":"2024","volume":"2","documentHash":"bd1b6d8d-edda-4d85-8ed7-68ba46be2364"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cycling","Active mobility","School travel","Regression model","Scenario"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059708850"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde28","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Szelągowski","uuid":"27F74A4788BFD3CE18AFEB15DDFD6AF68BFD26DF42B08C891FC5799E5B821C30B1F9540493266D7BECFDE07FFF614A4D3046CB12C2036C95DBF88BD8E077B779","orcidId":"0000-0002-5114-6793","documentHash":"e3659fe9-4b80-4538-b542-c25ae66f4639"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Berniak-Woźny","uuid":"6138BF6B0A41DA74BFC258AA49BE7E5394626426404BA3AC8D242813245830AFA5AACE0908A279A3C7F928737C7621C8210C452F3DFC7AD46842090E2364BA3B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3156-5755","documentHash":"95feafe5-9ec4-4ca4-8cd3-ceb6bdadc6bf"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-07-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66e3f58dfdbe830b5683506f","doi":"10.3390/info15080436","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/info15080436","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A Comprehensive Bibliometric Analysis of Business Process Management and Knowledge Management Integration: Bridging the Scholarly Gap","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the ever-evolving landscape of organisational optimisation, the integration of business process management (BPM) and knowledge management (KM) emerges as a critical challenge.

We conduct a review of the literature (since 2010), highlighting current knowledge, salient concepts, recent advances, remaning gaps, and future directions. We complement this with our expert knowledge spanning all areas of inquiry to provide a comprehensive, yet non-exhaustive, account that serves as an introduction to a breadth of multidisciplinary literature for a broad audience, spanning the full-chain of events from upstream determinants of health, to downstream health outcomes.

This results in high concentrations of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, often exceeding WHO standards. The paper discusses the current and expected effects of actions taken by the Warsaw authorities, to significantly improve air quality in the city. The policy directly addresses one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities). The analysis presented in the paper consists of two stages. The first, covering the years 2018–2029, deals with the ongoing Clean Air Program, which assumes primarily the reduction, and ultimately the complete elimination, of coal combustion in all heat sources of the residential sector. This sector is widely identified as the main source of urban air quality degradation, especially in Polish cities due to the dominant share of coal in the fuel mix. The second part of the corrective measures, covering the period 2024–2034, primarily concerns the reduction of nitrogen oxide pollution, mainly from traffic. The latter takes into account the expected effects of the introduction of a Low-emission Zone (LEZ) in the city center (launched in July 2024) and implemented in five two-year stages, in which car emission limits will be gradually tightened. According to the analysis results, the implementation of the Clean Air Program can result in about a 20% reduction in annual average PM2.5 concentrations by 2024, with a small (about 9%) reduction in NOx. At the same time, a significant reduction in NOx levels can be achieved by full implementation of the LEZ, especially within the zone boundaries (more than 50%). An important factor here is the size of the zone. The paper compares the effectiveness of two being considered versions, differing in size zones."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709232878c28a0473918f1","5e70922b878c28a04739100e","5e709232878c28a0473918ee"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-15","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a04739100e","5e709232878c28a0473918ee","5e709232878c28a0473918f1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724b","mniswId":"2021","title":"Atmosphere","issn":"2073-4433","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"00275c51-5236-4dd8-bc8c-39af87e7bbb0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66e40f8ffdbe830b5684643e","year":"2024","volume":"15","number":"9","documentHash":"7acd8174-271c-482d-ab3b-c636969c25ea"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["keyword urban air pollution","residential emission","road traffic emission","low emission zone","environmental impact"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059814160"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66eafc6bfdbe836650b28db7","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Szewczyk","documentHash":"46afd18a-6719-4c18-9d22-e21f1b646ebc"},{"objectId":"66eafc6bfdbe836650b28db6","name":"Audronė","lastName":"Lupeikienė","documentHash":"7c43a578-5746-4630-b2fe-836ac68eddc9"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde28","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Szelągowski","uuid":"27F74A4788BFD3CE18AFEB15DDFD6AF68BFD26DF42B08C891FC5799E5B821C30B1F9540493266D7BECFDE07FFF614A4D3046CB12C2036C95DBF88BD8E077B779","orcidId":"0000-0002-5114-6793","documentHash":"e3659fe9-4b80-4538-b542-c25ae66f4639"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Berniak-Woźny","uuid":"6138BF6B0A41DA74BFC258AA49BE7E5394626426404BA3AC8D242813245830AFA5AACE0908A279A3C7F928737C7621C8210C452F3DFC7AD46842090E2364BA3B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3156-5755","documentHash":"95feafe5-9ec4-4ca4-8cd3-ceb6bdadc6bf"}],"objectId":"66eafc6bfdbe836650b28db5","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-70445-1_13","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-70445-1_13","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Telemedicine and BPM in Cardiac Rehabilitation: A Comprehensive Post-Myocardial Infarction Care Program Case Study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the leading cause of mortality globally, accounting for approximately 30% of all deaths. Despite Poland’s exemplary system for managing myocardial infarctions, the country faces one of the highest mortality rates in Europe during the first year post-heart attack. This paper examines the transformative potential of integrating telemedicine and Business Process Management (BPM) in the treatment of chronic diseases, with a particular focus on cardiac telerehabilitation. Through an in-depth case study of the Comprehensive Post-Myocardial Infarction Care Program (KOS-Zawał), the research demonstrates how a BPM approach supported by telemedicine can enhance treatment quality and reduce mortality rates for post-heart attack patients. The study advocates for a paradigm shift from traditional healthcare models, emphasising the importance of collaboration among healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers. It highlights the ability of telemedicine to deliver personalised care, reduce healthcare costs, and improve patient outcomes. Cardiac telerehabilitation not only significantly lowers costs and provides greater accessibility compared to traditional rehabilitation but also provides preventive benefits, reducing the incidence of acute conditions such as heart attacks and preventing subsequent mortality or disability. Observations indicate that the KOS-Zawał program reduces the risk of death in the first year after myocardial infarction by almost 30% compared to standard care. By promoting a patient-centric and technologically advanced approach, this paper contributes to the evolving field of BPM in chronic disease management, underscoring the critical role of telemedicine and BPM in transforming healthcare delivery and improving patient outcomes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","5e709479878c28a0473bde28","66eafc6bfdbe836650b28db7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"205–219","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741880","mniswId":"878","fullName":"International Conference in Business Process Management","shortName":"BPM","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"456cbf22-8ebe-484e-bee2-a2dcd9558207"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"66eafa61fdbe836650b28788","startDate":"2024-09-01","endDate":"2024-09-06","fullName":"22nd International Conference on Business Process Management","shortName":"BPM 2024","city":"Krakow","country":"PL","website":"https://bpm2024.agh.edu.pl/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"2ebe787e-4def-4882-8d86-bf511e212716"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","66eafc6bfdbe836650b28db6","66eafc6bfdbe836650b28db7"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"66eafae4fdbe836650b2888f","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-70445-1","title":"Business Process Management: Blockchain, Robotic Process Automation, Central and Eastern European, Educators and Industry Forum: BPM 2024 Blockchain, RPA, CEE, Educators and Industry Forum, Krakow, Poland, September 1–6, 2024, Proceedings","year":2024,"isbn":"978-3-031-70444-4","url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-70445-1","translation":false,"documentHash":"54989fec-2684-4166-bbef-52d386af03ba"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["diagnostic and therapeutic processes","business process management (BPM)","telemedicine","chronic disease therapy","illustrative case study"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059821309"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde28","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Szelągowski","uuid":"27F74A4788BFD3CE18AFEB15DDFD6AF68BFD26DF42B08C891FC5799E5B821C30B1F9540493266D7BECFDE07FFF614A4D3046CB12C2036C95DBF88BD8E077B779","orcidId":"0000-0002-5114-6793","documentHash":"e3659fe9-4b80-4538-b542-c25ae66f4639"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Berniak-Woźny","uuid":"6138BF6B0A41DA74BFC258AA49BE7E5394626426404BA3AC8D242813245830AFA5AACE0908A279A3C7F928737C7621C8210C452F3DFC7AD46842090E2364BA3B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3156-5755","documentHash":"95feafe5-9ec4-4ca4-8cd3-ceb6bdadc6bf"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a0473946b5","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Grzesiak","uuid":"1B4865F082E9E876919A3FFDE647DBED6E46D5E24685D0055B7DFE319C34CDDD9D25BC505054FB9922D180AAF890AA43F8A03769EC1B37F9203F953BC0F04F22","orcidId":"0000-0001-5217-1061","documentHash":"3d49fed6-f563-4b2b-8ef7-0ce1fb89ed2c"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a0473945ed","name":"Marek","lastName":"Moszyński","uuid":"4D2B5186511193AC3B044781B5F70D1889084BC0AEAF6F7857E7FB85151BFA566CD6184614E75EC1FD27CDB1410533A71A578B481BAB272475CFA9E94FEE438E","documentHash":"dd2608fc-8a87-4d90-b29e-811f0141d01d"}],"objectId":"66f13fcffdbe833567aa82ad","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-70445-1_15","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-70445-1_15","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Enhancing Business Process Management Through Nature Assessment: Development and Deployment of the Business Process Nature Assessment Tool","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In contemporary business landscapes, the diverse nature of processes necessitates a thorough assessment before implementing Business Process Management (BPM). However, conducting such assessments can be arduous, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. This study aims to address this challenge by developing and showcasing the utility of an online tool based on the Business Process Nature Assessment Framework (BPNAF). The BPNAF facilitates integrated assessments of business processes, aligning with established BPM methodologies and lifecycles. Through an illustrative case study, this research examines the efficacy of this tool in assessing the processes/nature. The BPNA tool enables swift and effective evaluations of process unpredictability and knowledge intensity, aiding in selecting appropriate BPM methodologies, Knowledge Management (KM) and Human Resource Management (HRM) strategies, and supporting IT systems. Visualised results offer clear recommendations tailored to the organisation’s unique process landscape, accommodating standard and customised recommendations. By contributing insights into practical BPNAF implementation, this study plays a pivotal role in advancing BPM assessment methodologies and enriching the understanding and practice of BP management. This research underscores the critical role of BP assessment in organisational success, advocating for informed decision-making and best practices in BPM."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","5e709479878c28a0473bde28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"235–249","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741880","mniswId":"878","fullName":"International Conference in Business Process Management","shortName":"BPM","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"456cbf22-8ebe-484e-bee2-a2dcd9558207"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"66eafa61fdbe836650b28788","startDate":"2024-09-01","endDate":"2024-09-06","fullName":"22nd International Conference on Business Process Management","shortName":"BPM 2024","city":"Krakow","country":"PL","website":"https://bpm2024.agh.edu.pl/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"2ebe787e-4def-4882-8d86-bf511e212716"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70925d878c28a0473946b5","5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e70925d878c28a0473945ed","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"66eafae4fdbe836650b2888f","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-70445-1","title":"Business Process Management: Blockchain, Robotic Process Automation, Central and Eastern European, Educators and Industry Forum: BPM 2024 Blockchain, RPA, CEE, Educators and Industry Forum, Krakow, Poland, September 1–6, 2024, Proceedings","year":2024,"isbn":"978-3-031-70444-4","url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-70445-1","translation":false,"documentHash":"54989fec-2684-4166-bbef-52d386af03ba"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["business process","business process management (BPM)","process nature","business process nature assessment framework (BPNAF)","illustrative case study"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059824600"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709460878c28a0473bbb37","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kaczmarek-Majer","uuid":"0087CB6164DB0E85F06F1E33A2F188BD3B4D4B8B535FBDFD1B35F1237A1063F10FC364FE3B1DB1E69F4D42AE88BEBAA8DA8D9BFEBE15113835244D62D71574C8","documentHash":"506043a3-b093-402e-b5cf-5d2037ba7f11"},{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a0473918ef","name":"Olgierd","lastName":"Hryniewicz","uuid":"23CA97097CFB2D4AE572AAAD298CF7D5C0E3B9E7F70A97CA42ACBF81FB08322FF66C6A1C4DCA4000A87FF30E939C331D34E304519A57C48CAAE3E4838824ADFC","orcidId":"0000-0001-9877-508X","documentHash":"2c39abe5-e8b1-49fa-8939-1907610180dc"}],"objectId":"66f6647dfdbe831edead7d8f","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-65993-5_22","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-65993-5_22","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Aggregation of Inhomogeneous Non-stationary Time Series Using P-Boxes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Monitoring of inhomogeneous   non-stationary processes has been considered.

optimality conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Optimality conditions for optimal control problems arising in network modeling are discussed. We confine ourselves to the steady state network models. Therefore, we consider only control systems described by ordinary differential equations. First, we derive optimality conditions for the nonlinear problem for a single beam. These conditions are formulated in terms of the local Pontryagin maximum principle and the matrix Riccati equation. Then, the optimality conditions for the control problem for networks posed on an arbitrary planar graph are discussed. This problem has a set of independent variables xi varying within their intervals [0, li], associated with the corresponding beams at network edges.

It presents and summarises research on the nature of business processes in Industry 4.0/5.0 conducted by researchers from 7 Polish universities. The study combines a systematic literature review based on the SCOPUS database and a survey of 466 respondents with an analysis of 12,573 processes. Filling the cognitive gap in Industry 4.0/5.0 organisations, the study reveals that nearly 60% of all BPs are semi-structured processes. At the same time, it shows a strong relationship between the importance of processes for the organisation and the dynamics of their execution. This finding highlights the importance of adaptability and flexibility in organisational dynamics, reflecting the nuanced nature of most BPs. The article presents original research on a diverse sample of Polish enterprises based on the simplified Business Processes Nature Assessment Framework. The presented research results indicate the need to update the essential elements of the BPM concept, such as BPM Lifecycle, BPM implementation method, or BPM maturity assessment, to consider various assessment criteria and implementation methods depending on the nature of BPs. The study contributes to advancing both theoretical knowledge and practical applications in the field of BPM, providing valuable insights for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers alike."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e70945c878c28a0473bb65e","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-15","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","5e70945c878c28a0473bb65e","5e7092b1878c28a04739acc4","5e70922b878c28a04739108e","5e709472878c28a0473bd40a","5e709347878c28a0473a640f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1ce","mniswId":"6928","title":"Future Business Journal","issn":"2314-7210","eissn":"2314-7210","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"ec148df4-c039-4ef0-bbbc-7baba1d3e05c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6752beeafdbe83525b8fae3c","year":"2024","volume":"10","number":"1","documentHash":"d45b3276-046d-4f86-882e-287df4434bcb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Business process management (BPM)","Business process nature","Business process classification","Industry 4.0","Industry 5.0"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059972383"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391019","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Stańczak","uuid":"DA2B04A9DEC64395130272C3DE2B80F85A2940C452594AFDB480492A5B3E4F8D1A58F6708DF7B10EF64F6A3D1D82695AE237AB745157B67F4F5800DB22D00508","documentHash":"d0b01401-93a3-4bc2-a194-85c321378a7e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676198eefdbe836571686b56","doi":"10.7494/csci.2024.25.1.5330","publicUri":"https://journals.agh.edu.pl/csci/article/view/5330","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Efficient Selection Methods in Evolutionary Algorithms","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Evolutionary algorithms mimic some elements of the theory of evolution. The survival of individuals and the possibility of producing offspring play a huge role in the process of natural evolution. This process is called a natural selection.\nThis mechanism is responsible for eliminating poor population members and gives the possibility of development for good ones. The evolutionary algorithm - an instance of evolution in the computer environment also requires a selection method, a computer version of natural selection. Widely used standard selection methods applied in evolutionary algorithms are usually derived from nature and prefer competition, randomness and some kind of ``fight'' among individuals. But computer environment is quite different from nature. Computer populations of individuals are usually small, they easily suffer from a premature convergence to local extremes. To avoid this drawback, computer selection methods must have different features than natural selection. In the computer selection methods randomness, fight and competition should be controlled or influenced to operate to the desired extent. Several new methods of individual selection are proposed in this work: several kinds of mixed selection, an interval selection and a taboo selection.

The method uses n identical, repairable, mutually independent sample units and proceeds as follows: First, each item undergoes m-1 failures followed by minimal repairs and is discarded after failure No. m. The resulting times-to-failure compose n independent samples, each of size m, where the times within one sample are neither independent nor identically distributed. Second, the obtained data are used to compute n MLE estimates of alpha and lambda, where the j-th pair of estimates are based on the times-to-failure of item No. j, j = n. Third, the mean value of the above n estimates is computed for each parameter, to obtain more accurate estimates. The main results of (Malinowski, 2022) are the closed-form expressions for the considered MLE estimators and their biases. It should be noted here that the generally known MLE estimator of the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution, based on IID sampling, is obtained from an equation that cannot be solved analytically. However, the accuracy of the estimators obtained in (Malinowski, 2022) was not established, because no formulas for their variances could be found. This difficulty has been overcome in the present paper, where the respective formulas are derived and then used in the analysis of confidence intervals for alpha and lambda."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii

The model in which the fuzzy environment is equated with fuzzy constraints on values of variables, fuzzy goals on values of performance functions, and a fuzzy decision which constitutes the aggregation of the fuzzy constraints and goals. The model provides a powerful conceptual and algorithmic basis for a multitude of decision making, optimization, control, etc. models. Traditional aggregation operators employed to combine the fuzzy constraints and fuzzy goals to form the fuzzy decision have originally been the minimum and than some other triangular norms, notably the algebraic product. In this paper, we propose to extend this aggregation to a nonstandard operator “and, if possible\" which has been successfully employed in Zadrożny and Kacprzyk’s [19] approach to bipolar database queries.

Basing on the preferences over items made by users in the past, a CFRS generates a class of users similar to the targeted user, and then recommends those items which were approved by the users from the generated class. In many cases, existing similarity relations cannot provide reliable prediction of the item recommendations in CFRS applications, which is due not only to users’ interests in objects of complex structure, but also to the lack of subjective information, which is related to the users’ social status, in short with his profile data. In many cases, in CFRS models, it is necessary to consider the interactions of model criteria and their individual degrees of dominance and influence on possible predictive decisions. The idea of our approach is based on the use of the possibility theory, when criteria importance levels and criteria pair interaction indexes in the model environment are evaluated by the decision maker or the experts, people who are involved in the assessments. In our modeling scheme the generated possibility degrees of influence on the alternatives of the criteria, take into account the values of criteria pairwise interaction indexes. Based on the principle of maximum for the Shapley entropy determined on the criteria, a mathematical programming problem is formulated, the solution of which is the possibility measure’s distribution generated on the set of criteria. We use the generated possibility measure in the definition of extensions of aggregation operators such as the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) and finite Choquet averaging (CA) operators. The confidence discrimination q-rung picture linguistic fuzzy (CD-q-RPLF) environment of expert evaluations are considered as aggregation arguments. New constructed confidence q-rung picture linguistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (C-q-RPLFOWA) and confidence q-rung picture linguistic fuzzy Choquet averaging (C-q-RPLFCA) operators are used in the evaluation of predictions of the CFRS. We develop CD-q-RPLF CFRS methodology, where users’ profile data by the constructed operators in the new users’ similarity measure under q-RPLF environment are aggregated. New extensions of discrimination values in the constructions of users’ similarity measures are included. Classical Jaccard index is transformed into discrimination q-RPLFNs. The main goal of the results illustration was to aggregate users’ profile data by the constructed operators in the similarity measure under confidence discrimination q-RPLF environments.

It is shown that the trajectories of the dynamical system defined on finite energy phase space are attracted asymptotically to a global attractor. The main challenges of the problem are related to: (i) superlinearity of the elastic energy of the structural component, (ii) Boussinesq effects of internal forces potentially leading to a finite time blowing up solutions, (iii) partially-restricted boundary dissipation placed on the interface only. The resulting system lacks dissipativity along with the suitable compactness properties, both corner stones of PDE dynamical system theories [1]. To contend with the difficulties, a new hybrid approach based on a suitable adaptation of the so called “energy methods” [2, 3] and compensated compactness [4] has been developed.

It has been observed that the structures exhibit significant nonlinear damping effects which are functions of the energy of the system. The present work is devoted to the study of long-time dynamics to a class of extensible beams/plates featuring nonlocal nonlinear energy damping of hyperbolic nature. Such models arise frequently in aeroelasticity when modeling flight structures, see NASA-AirForce reports (Balakrishnan in A theory of nonlinear damping in flexible structures. Stabilization of flexible structures, 1988; Balakrishnan and Taylor in Proceedings Damping 89, Flight Dynamics Lab and Air Force Wright Aeronautical Labs, WPAFB, 1989). The main mathematical challenge in this context is twofold: (1) nonlinear and potentially degenerate energy damping coefficient, (2) energy damping at a critical level where the usual compactness arguments (critical to the theory of attractors) do not apply. Our investigation sheds some light on a long-time behavior of such class of problems, providing new results in the area of existence of attractors and their properties within this hyperbolic-like framework. This should be contrasted with widely studied parabolic-like models involving structural damping which is known to be poorly understood. The goal is achieved by developing new methodology which allows to circumvent the difficulties related to the lack of compactness and non-locality of the nonlinear damping. The results are achieved through a rigorous analysis that reveals an interplay between extensibility, non-locality, and nonlinear energy damping of critical exponent."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927d878c28a0473968d6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"390","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"1821-1862","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676e8ed1fdbe8322e23cd715","676e8ed1fdbe8322e23cd716","5e70927d878c28a0473968d6","676e8ed1fdbe8322e23cd717"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478dcc","mniswId":"14058","title":"Mathematische Annalen","issn":"0025-5831","eissn":"1432-1807","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"8598e6e1-7af9-4e13-b32c-cc1ece600d54"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6756fb42fdbe833c07ea30fe","year":"2024","volume":"390","number":"2","documentHash":"fea6d2d9-3ed0-4e0e-ae08-43c1cbd63f04"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060285099"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677ff020fdbe831a91d98dbd","name":"Weixing","lastName":"Zheng","documentHash":"7f107e6a-0302-4bb9-a9b0-0ef8729ebada"},{"objectId":"677ff020fdbe831a91d98dbc","name":"Zhen","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"782cb7b4-a3cf-4c87-8f3e-c0e4a211ff98"},{"objectId":"677ff020fdbe831a91d98dbb","name":"Fengyu","lastName":"Xu","documentHash":"9f450472-df20-4746-b41c-72e43739944d"},{"objectId":"677ff020fdbe831a91d98dba","name":"Zhengxin","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"a33639ce-d9a4-4c7e-8e38-edfbad1678b4"},{"objectId":"677ff020fdbe831a91d98db9","name":"Min","lastName":"Xiao","documentHash":"a02aa4fd-9276-4464-ae3c-1864abc091ee"},{"objectId":"677ff020fdbe831a91d98db8","name":"Hua","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"4e8f750e-d258-40bf-8ffd-26575312c030"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e75e","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"A56F3A8C2F6246587B88982FE48FEA2855A7B5222539A126265F1D882510368FD87B8932975E7451D01686982B7D3158DA885EF3F5FFA39E4B9D9EE6FD22470F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6960-9525","documentHash":"715a0529-c457-4823-a66d-ee6bebb7dd83"}],"objectId":"677ff020fdbe831a91d98db6","doi":"10.1088/1402-4896/ad8688","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/ad8688","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A new chemical networked system: spatial-temporal evolution and control","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper constructs a scale-free chemical network based on the Gierer-Meinhardt (GM) system and investigates its Turing instability. We establish a fractional-order single-node GM system with delay and design a fractional-order proportional derivative (PD) control strategy for the issue of bifurcation control. Using delay as bifurcation parameter, the existence of Hopf bifurcation is proven, and control over bifurcation threshold points is achieved through a fractional-order PD control strategy. For the scale-free chemical network based on the GM system, we obtain the condition of how the Turing instability occurs.

In this contribution we address the important question of finding the optimal location of the compressors. This problem is of a novel structure, since it is related to the gas dynamics that governs the network flow. That results in nonconvex mixed integer stochastic optimization problems with probabilistic constraints.\n\nUsing a steady state model for the gas flow in pipeline networks including compressor control and uncertain loads given by certain probability distributions, we consider the problem of finding the optimal location for the control on the network such that the control cost is minimal and the gas pressure stays within given bounds.\n\nIn the deterministic setting, we present explicit bounds for the pipe length and the inlet pressure such that a unique optimal compressor location with minimal control cost exists. In the probabilistic setting, we give an existence result for the optimal compressor location and discuss the uniqueness of the solution depending on the probability distribution. For Gaussian distributed loads a uniqueness result for the optimal compressor location is presented.\n\nWe further present the problem of finding optimal compressor locations on networks including the number of compressor stations as a variable. Results for the existence of optimal locations on a graph in both the deterministic and the probabilistic setting are presented, and the uniqueness of the solutions is discussed depending on probability distributions and graph topology. The paper concludes with an illustrative example on a diamond graph demonstrating that the minimal number of compressor stations is not necessarily equal to the optimal number of compressor stations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396dab"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"507-546","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677fc442fdbe831a91d5262b","677fc442fdbe831a91d5262c","5e709281878c28a047396dab"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cc46","mniswId":"14049","title":"Mathematics and Mechanics of Complex Systems","issn":"2326-7186","eissn":"2325-3444","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"8d81f111-791a-4c8f-8d7c-a85fae262653"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677fc442fdbe831a91d5262a","year":"2024","volume":"12","number":"4","documentHash":"2a19bc59-1836-4cd0-8a27-7cdacab1f8bf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gas network","compressor control","compressor location","Weber problem","optimal location","uncertain boundary data","nonconvex mixed integer stochastic problem"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060291660"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6773edcafdbe833e3d18fa7b","name":"Francisco Javier","lastName":"Cabrerizo","documentHash":"b0e27c81-e270-48e3-8beb-29774a5cdc8e"},{"objectId":"6773edcafdbe833e3d18fa7a","name":"Enrique","lastName":"Herrera-Viedma","documentHash":"0531b123-079e-4eb8-bd62-fefffa910158"},{"objectId":"6773edcafdbe833e3d18fa79","name":"María Ángeles","lastName":"Martínez","documentHash":"f3db7221-1e97-4cf2-ab49-317705064536"},{"objectId":"6773edcafdbe833e3d18fa78","name":"José Ramón","lastName":"Trillo","documentHash":"8df8b299-fb06-41fd-8578-b30e98f3a0cd"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739101f","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Zadrożny","uuid":"C34AE9CE91E6A1B4C123DDE8FEA58BD66D2144E8AD5551ED1D54D774E4A2E152FA2ADDBF74E3FB1377E7B6BBD67255F2566A7E10A1E4194429AEDCFFD702F891","orcidId":"0000-0002-6642-0927","documentHash":"bb76266c-0da9-4d75-83ef-53badcb12c83"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391000","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kacprzyk","uuid":"4A8B2CA444BD6ED60EACF6DE687FF3AF9E95EF07222C91937E5CA1F185E2124FF08DCD7D9A596E8E60911E67B522D3EBFC737B67D6B4294639E916338A719CCB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4187-5877","documentHash":"13701ef2-8325-46ae-a25f-9758ec64477a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"6773edcafdbe833e3d18fa76","doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2024.08.161","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2024.08.161","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A Group Decision-Making Approach Leveraging Preference Relations Derived from Large Language Model","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Group decision-making involves selecting among limited options.

How to detect and prevent the spatiotemporal evolution of malware is the major challenge we are facing now. This paper is concerned with the control of Turing patterns arising in a malware propagation model depicted by partial differential equations for the first time. From the control theoretic perspective, the goal is not only to predict the formation and evolution of patterns but also to design the spatiotemporal state feedback scheme to modulate the switch of patterns between different modes. The Turing instability conditions are obtained for the controlled malware propagation model with cross-diffusion. Then, the multi-scale analysis is carried out to explore the amplitude equations near the threshold of Turing bifurcation. The selection and stability of pattern formations are determined based on the established amplitude equations. It is proved that the reaction–diffusion propagation model has three types of patterns: hexagonal pattern, striped pattern, and mixed pattern, and selecting the appropriate control parameters can make the pattern transform among the three patterns. The results of the analysis are numerically verified and provide valuable insights into dynamics and control of patterns embedded in reaction–diffusion systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"34","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1-17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6780f16bfdbe834a810947d7","6780f16bfdbe834a810947d8","6780f16bfdbe834a810947d9","5e709200878c28a04738e75e","6780f16bfdbe834a810947da"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775bb","mniswId":"3449","title":"Chaos","issn":"1054-1500","eissn":"1089-7682","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5096a57d-3cce-4ecf-8ec7-9dd072e8f825"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6780f16bfdbe834a810947d6","year":"2024","volume":"34","number":"3","documentHash":"26284a3f-5cd2-4fd6-a3c8-61eb906f53f3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Linear stability analysis","Nonlinear control theory","Reaction-diffusion system","Partial differential equations","Perturbation analysis","Malware"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060298505"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6780f94ffdbe834a810a5507","name":"Jinde","lastName":"Cao","documentHash":"a4207719-80e8-4b94-8b91-becbb07c3826"},{"objectId":"6780f94ffdbe834a810a5506","name":"Haibo","lastName":"Bao","documentHash":"a81fb146-9c02-4230-944b-5d118b3fb14d"},{"objectId":"6780f94ffdbe834a810a5505","name":"Yunxiang","lastName":"Lu","documentHash":"ce50a9df-73cf-4021-9e95-57e075bd4be1"},{"objectId":"6780f94ffdbe834a810a5504","name":"Min","lastName":"Xiao","documentHash":"aff844a7-56eb-4d85-9390-749cb50dc432"},{"objectId":"6780f94ffdbe834a810a5503","name":"Haokuan","lastName":"Cheng","documentHash":"d3dc332a-9c77-4198-835d-6c91ad8726d1"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e75e","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"A56F3A8C2F6246587B88982FE48FEA2855A7B5222539A126265F1D882510368FD87B8932975E7451D01686982B7D3158DA885EF3F5FFA39E4B9D9EE6FD22470F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6960-9525","documentHash":"715a0529-c457-4823-a66d-ee6bebb7dd83"}],"objectId":"6780f94ffdbe834a810a5502","doi":"10.1088/1402-4896/ad30ee","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/ad30ee","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Complex pattern evolution of a two-dimensional space diffusion model of malware spread","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In order to investigate the propagation mechanism of malware in cyber-physical systems (CPSs), the cross-diffusion in two-dimensional space is attempted to be introduced into a class of susceptible-infected (SI) malware propagation model depicted by partial differential equations (PDEs). Most of the traditional reaction-diffusion models of malware propagation only take into account the self-diffusion in one-dimensional space, but take less consideration of the cross-diffusion in two-dimensional space. This paper investigates the spatial diffusion behaviour of malware nodes spreading through physical devices. The formations of Turing patterns after homogeneous stationary instability triggered by Turing bifurcation are investigated by linear stability analysis and multiscale analysis methods. The conditions under the occurence of Hopf bifurcation and Turing bifurcation in the malware model are obtained. The amplitude equations are derived in the vicinity of the bifurcation point to explore the conditions for the formation of Turing patterns in two-dimensional space. And the corresponding patterns are obtained by varying the control parameters. It is shown that malicious virus nodes spread in different forms including hexagons, stripes and a mixture of the two. This paper will extend a new direction for the study of system security theory."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"99","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1-19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6780f94ffdbe834a810a5503","6780f94ffdbe834a810a5504","6780f94ffdbe834a810a5505","6780f94ffdbe834a810a5506","5e709200878c28a04738e75e","6780f94ffdbe834a810a5507"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479257","mniswId":"16067","title":"Physica Scripta","issn":"0031-8949","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"10810440-e084-497f-a45f-28e9431ffb56"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677f96a1fdbe831a91d03610","year":"2024","volume":"99","number":"4","documentHash":"ce068560-920c-40b7-a3b6-0c1c6881b8ba"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cyber-physical systems","malware propagation","reaction-diffusion","amplitude equation","Turing instability","pattern formation","Hopf bifurcation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060299041"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67812d69fdbe834a8112268f","name":"Seifedine","lastName":"Kadry","documentHash":"e7d20d87-b2b6-4fe5-8f4d-0ac650f0e2e1"},{"objectId":"67812d69fdbe834a8112268e","name":"Muhammet","lastName":"Deveci","documentHash":"1892317a-0c95-4319-a19d-e05c8017042c"},{"objectId":"67812d69fdbe834a8112268d","name":"Yu","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"b8c1232e-2411-41bd-a913-2968b097911c"},{"objectId":"67812d69fdbe834a8112268c","name":"Yi","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"f50c740d-6aa3-4d31-abe1-cb50d3168248"},{"objectId":"67812d69fdbe834a8112268b","name":"Weizhong","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"a056a83b-9f7b-4daf-94da-3f8da1019d34"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"67812d69fdbe834a81122689","doi":"10.1016/j.jii.2024.100614","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jii.2024.100614","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Analyzing the barriers to resilience supply chain adoption in the food industry using hybrid interval-valued fermatean fuzzy PROMETHEE-II model","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The resilient food supply chain (RFSC) has been identified as an effective model for mitigating food supply chain (FSC) risks. However, there exist many barriers impacting the implementation of the RFSC. Further, previous studies seldom utilize integrated decision models for identifying and ranking the barriers to implementing RFSC within uncertain environments. Thus, the study establishes an interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy (IVFF) decision framework to identify and rank these barriers. The framework is classified into four stages. First, to model the interaction between preference information, we introduce the IVFF-prioritized weighted average (PWA) operator to collect this information. Then, an integrated IVFF-CRITIC method is proposed to calculate the barrier weights considering their inter-correlation relationships. Next, the IVFF-PWA operator and IVFF-CRITIC method are incorporated into the PROMETHEE-II model to rank the barrier levels of alternative participation in the FSC. Further, a case study about analyzing implementation barriers to RFSC is employed to test the effectiveness and practicality of the presented framework. The result shows that the participation food processing company (priority: 0.161) has the highest barrier level. The findings of this article may offer decision support to stakeholders for mitigating the barriers to implementing a resilient supply chain in the food industry."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"40","pagesFromTo":"1-19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67812d69fdbe834a8112268b","67812d69fdbe834a8112268c","67812d69fdbe834a8112268d","67812d69fdbe834a8112268e","67812d69fdbe834a8112268f","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c893","mniswId":"11424","title":"Journal of Industrial Information Integration","issn":"2452-414X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"dcbfe965-154b-42d4-b2ff-bfd27bf24a2d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67812d69fdbe834a8112268a","year":"2024","volume":"40","documentHash":"6f9960f8-d94b-46a5-92bc-a7f5479e2420"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Supply chain","Interval-valued fermatean fuzzy set","Promethee-ii model","CRITIC","food supply chain resilience"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060302510"},{"authors":[],"objectId":"677294a1fdbe831015c9ed8f","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-50495-2","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-50495-2","type":"EDITED_BOOK","typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","year":2024,"title":"Computational Intelligence in Engineering and Project Management","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This book is dedicated to all those interested in the application of artificial intelligence in engineering and project management. Most of the jobs are focused on achieving agile project development. New algorithms that combine various computational intelligence techniques are applied in different areas of knowledge in project management.\n\nIn this book, computational intelligence is presented as the branch of AI that encompasses various techniques aimed at simulating human tolerance in decision-making processes in environments with uncertainty and imprecision. Among the precursor techniques of computational intelligence are: evolutionary algorithms, artificial neural networks, fuzzy set theory, and fuzzy systems. However, other areas such as the rough set, linguistic data summary, natural language processing, the conversational systems, fuzzy cognitive maps, collective intelligence, the neutrosophic theory, and other fuzzy logic extensions are contributing to the application and extension of computational intelligence\n\nThe book is organized into three parts, as shown below. The first part constitutes a critical review of computational intelligence in project management. The second part presents new computational intelligence techniques and their applications in project planning, control, and monitoring processes. In particular, the use of conversational systems and their applicability in the agile management of portfolio programs and projects stand out. Part three of the book exemplifies the use of computing techniques with words and other computational intelligence techniques for organizational decision-making.\n\nThe authors of the book stand out for their extensive experience in the development of basic and applied applications of computational intelligence. The authors Janusz Kacprzyk, Pedro Y. Piñero Pérez, Rafael E. Bello Pérez, and Iliana Pérez Pupo have published several books associated with artificial intelligence and computational intelligence applied to projects. They continue working on fundamental-oriented and applied research on different artificial intelligence techniques to help with decision-making in different areas of knowledge.\n\nAuthors would like to thank all the engineers, professors, and researchers without whose efforts this book could not have been written."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391000"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"EDITOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["677294a1fdbe831015c9ed90","5e70922b878c28a047391000","677294a1fdbe831015c9ed91","677294a1fdbe831015c9ed92"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"9783031504945","issn":"1860-949X","pages":367,"series":"Studies in Computational Intelligence","numberInSeries":"1134","editionNumber":"1","translation":false,"publicationPlace":"Cham","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"editors":[{"objectId":"677294a1fdbe831015c9ed92","name":"Iliana Pérez","lastName":"Pupo","documentHash":"7421e794-a8b4-43fc-b9f6-6875d9f104ff"},{"objectId":"677294a1fdbe831015c9ed91","name":"Rafael","lastName":"Bello Pérez","documentHash":"14b37e3d-f5ca-4e57-bef0-8a58644c17b3"},{"objectId":"677294a1fdbe831015c9ed90","name":"Pedro Yobanis","lastName":"Piñero Pérez","documentHash":"140de7ba-201d-4418-bf78-5ee8f9795f44"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391000","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kacprzyk","uuid":"4A8B2CA444BD6ED60EACF6DE687FF3AF9E95EF07222C91937E5CA1F185E2124FF08DCD7D9A596E8E60911E67B522D3EBFC737B67D6B4294639E916338A719CCB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4187-5877","documentHash":"13701ef2-8325-46ae-a25f-9758ec64477a"}],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Computational Intelligence","Computational Intelligence in Engineering","Computational Intelligence in Project Management","CIIP","CIIP23"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060311363"},{"authors":[],"objectId":"677298cbfdbe831015ca46ea","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-52388-5","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-52388-5","type":"EDITED_BOOK","typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","year":2024,"title":"International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Systems for Sustainable Development (AI2SD’2023): Advanced Intelligent Systems on Digital Health Technology, Volume 1","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This book encapsulates the innovative discussions held during the International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Systems for Sustainable Development (AI2SD'2023), which took place at Mohammed 6 University of Sciences and Health Casablanca, Morocco.\n\nThis book delves into the multifaceted realm of advanced intelligent systems, specifically focusing on digital health technology.

The dynamics is subject to a nonlinear boundary dissipation. This leads to a non-dissipative dynamics. The existence of solution is demonstrated by means of Faedo–Galerkin method combined with monotone operator theory in handling nonlinear boundary conditions. The main result pertains to exponential decay rates for energy, which depend on the geometry of the spatial domain, viscoelastic effects, the strength of delay and the strength of mechanical boundary damping. An important feature of the model is the fact that the delay term and stabilizing mechanism are not collocated geometrically — in contrast with many other works on the subject.

A type of FG that is widely used in medical and psychological sciences is vague graph (VG). VGs play an important role in various fields such as computer science, psychology, medicine, and political sciences and are used to find effective people in an organization or social institution. Regularity is very important in the VG theory because it can help a lot in identifying people with high ability in an institute or social group. In addition to regularity, the degree of nodes and edges also play an effective role in this relationship and can evaluate the ability and knowledge of people. Therefore, in this paper, first perfectly regular vague graph (PRVG) is introduced and investigated the regularity of vertices. The totally accurate communication between all connected vertices is described by defining completely open neighborhood degree (COND) and completely closed neighborhood degree (CCND) of vertices and edges in a VG. In the following, ((𝑠1, 𝑠2),𝑚, (𝑡1, 𝑡2))-regular vague graph and totally ((𝑠1, 𝑠2),𝑚, (𝑡1, 𝑡2))-regular vague graph are introduced and a necessary and sufficient condition under which they are equivalent is presented. Psychologists play a significant role in creating a healthy society in terms of physical and mental health. They help people in the society to better understand their emotions and behaviors and manage them to live a better life. So in the final part, an application of COND and CCND in psychological sciences has been introduced."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391000"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"42","issue":"5-6","pagesFromTo":"405-424","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6773b638fdbe833e3d174f97","6773b638fdbe833e3d174f98","5e70922b878c28a047391000","6773b638fdbe833e3d174f99","6773b638fdbe833e3d174f9a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788c0","mniswId":"11938","title":"Journal of Multiple-Valued Logic and Soft Computing","issn":"1542-3980","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c57b27b0-4197-4ac9-92fb-aa7dc4c93b0a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6773b638fdbe833e3d174f96","year":"2024","volume":"42","number":"5-6","documentHash":"5f8ecce3-ccf6-459a-9c82-95dc6e800630"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Vague set","total degree","perfect regular","open neighborhood","close neighborhood"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060321801"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6773b9f2fdbe833e3d17671f","name":"Tung-Lin","lastName":"Chuang","documentHash":"c0bcfe8c-18c2-4f2a-ad50-5613e20f69dc"},{"objectId":"6773b9f2fdbe833e3d17671e","name":"Kuei-Lun","lastName":"Chang","documentHash":"8f133453-cce4-4832-b558-941c8d0828f0"},{"objectId":"6773b9f2fdbe833e3d17671d","name":"Michael Yu-Ching","lastName":"Lin","documentHash":"250549f2-b0d5-4f1d-b62f-2a8536e6df3c"},{"objectId":"6773b9f2fdbe833e3d17671c","name":"Shu-Che","lastName":"Chi","documentHash":"684dc47f-bd29-420b-bf02-d308df7e016c"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391000","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kacprzyk","uuid":"4A8B2CA444BD6ED60EACF6DE687FF3AF9E95EF07222C91937E5CA1F185E2124FF08DCD7D9A596E8E60911E67B522D3EBFC737B67D6B4294639E916338A719CCB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4187-5877","documentHash":"13701ef2-8325-46ae-a25f-9758ec64477a"}],"objectId":"6773b9f2fdbe833e3d17671b","publicUri":"https://www.oldcitypublishing.com/journals/mvlsc-home/mvlsc-issue-contents/mvlsc-volume-42-number-5-6-2024/mvlsc-42-5-6-p-439-461/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A New MCDM Model for the Optimal Selection of Sales Representatives in Cable Television Service System Providers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A new approach to the solution of an important problem of a better use of personnel, sales representatives, for cable television service system providers in Taiwan is discussed.

One of the main challenges is related to only partial availability of the performance metrics: although some users can be unambiguously classified as bots, the correct label is uncertain in many cases. This calls for the use of classifiers capable of explaining their decisions. This paper demonstrates two such mechanisms based on features carefully engineered from web logs. The first is a man-made rule-based system. The second is a hierarchical model that first performs clustering and next classification using human-centred, interpretable methods. The stability of the proposed methods is analyzed and a minimal set of features that convey the class-discriminating information is selected. The proposed data processing and analysis methodology are successfully applied to real-world data sets from online publishers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a04739101f","5e709232878c28a0473918ef","5e70922b878c28a047391010","5e70927e878c28a047396bdb","659c022b4097076e5904db3d","659c022b4097076e5904db3e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1178-1188","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659c022b4097076e5904db3d","5e709232878c28a0473918ef","659c022b4097076e5904db3e","659c022b4097076e5904db3f","5e70927e878c28a047396bdb","5e70922b878c28a047391010","5e70922b878c28a04739101f","659c022b4097076e5904db40"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bf2b","mniswId":"5080","title":"Digital Communications and Networks","issn":"2468-5925","eissn":"2352-8648","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"a3e21127-48eb-47a6-8465-9d6c8ef92841"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67876db2fdbe8374ef28da0e","year":"2024","volume":"10","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"72698ed8-451e-462a-8bb2-f5672f6411d7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Web logs","Classification","Clustering","Web traffic","Bots","Interpretability"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060345891"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678796dafdbe8374ef2d57a5","name":"Qirui","lastName":"You","documentHash":"593a083d-0902-45ae-9963-79a4e961f818"},{"objectId":"678796dafdbe8374ef2d57a4","name":"Fang","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"160f1381-9bbd-466b-9e82-fc17b57b286e"},{"objectId":"678796dafdbe8374ef2d57a3","name":"Ziqian","lastName":"Luo","documentHash":"603e7560-00e1-446e-b144-df358794e448"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"678796dafdbe8374ef2d57a1","doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2024.111439","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2024.111439","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A two-objective-optimization-driven group decision making model under the bipolarity of decision information","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"When building consensus in group decision making (GDM) under uncertainty, an important yet rarely studied issue is to find the Pareto solutions of multi-objective optimization model. This paper reports a two-objective (2Ob) optimization driven consensus model in GDM by describing the bipolarity of judgements through intuitionistic multiplicative preference relations (IMPRs). First, it is realized that the inherent property of IMPRs is the hesitancy degree. A novel inconsistency index of IMPRs is proposed by combining the effects of hesitancy degree and inconsistency of boundary matrices. Second, the compatibility measure between two IMPRs is utilized to quantify the consensus level (CL) of decision makers. The threshold of acceptable group CL is found to decrease with the order of IMPRs for the first time. A 2Ob optimization model is constructed by minimizing group inconsistency degree and group CL, respectively. Third, the method of equipping two flexibility degrees to each expert is proposed for optimizing individual IMPRs. It is interesting to find that the constructed granularity matrix is different from interval-valued IMPRs. A multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to obtain a set of Pareto solutions to GDM problems. Case studies are carried out to illustrate the proposed consensus reaching model. The results help to identify how to provide flexible decisions in GDM under some complexity and uncertainty of a practical problem."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"155","pagesFromTo":"1-14","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["678796dafdbe8374ef2d57a3","678796dafdbe8374ef2d57a4","678796dafdbe8374ef2d57a5","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477150","mniswId":"1519","title":"Applied Soft Computing Journal","issn":"1568-4946","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"890e228a-57d2-4fd2-951d-0b511604feff"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678796dafdbe8374ef2d57a2","year":"2024","volume":"155","documentHash":"fddd3b93-a7bd-43ba-96e7-f1c78d2f7af5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Group decision making (GDM)","Intuitionistic multiplicative preference relation (IMPR)","Consistency and consensus","Two-objective (2Ob) optimization","Pareto solution"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060348605"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6787a501fdbe8374ef2ec780","name":"Nagat","lastName":"Drawel","documentHash":"872a35e7-7556-430a-bf17-30584d1f67a4"},{"objectId":"6787a501fdbe8374ef2ec77f","name":"Jamal","lastName":"Bentahar","documentHash":"9e572770-83a8-4b71-ba56-3cf7ad086c30"},{"objectId":"6787a501fdbe8374ef2ec77e","name":"Narges","lastName":"Baharloo","documentHash":"877102fe-298e-4d45-8fa6-a95b0672e4fd"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"6787a501fdbe8374ef2ec77c","doi":"10.1016/j.eswa.2023.122856","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.122856","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Model checking combined trust and commitments in Multi-Agent Systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Trust and social commitments have been studied with different objectives for communication in Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) separately. The purpose of this paper is to present the first logical framework to explore the relationship between two key concepts in autonomous MASs, namely trust and commitments among agents, along with its model checking algorithms. An analysis is performed on this relationship, with a specific emphasis on the perspectives of semantics and model checking. The analysis is carried out within the framework of Trust Computation Tree Logic with Commitments (CTLC) logic, an extended logic built on top of the standard branching temporal Computation Tree Logic (CTL) by including modalities for reasoning about commitments and their fulfillment. Moreover, the study employs a trust operator to facilitate trust reasoning. We propose thus Trust Computation Tree Logic with Commitments (TCTLC), a new logic able to express properties about trust and commitments simultaneously. Such rich properties cannot be expressed in other languages. We introduce the semantics using the extended formalism of interpreted systems. We propose some postulates and proofs that show how we can reason about combined trust and commitments in the logic proposed. New Binary Decision Diagram (BDD)-based algorithms for our logic are presented and implemented as additional libraries of the Model Checker for Multi-Agent Systems (MCMAS), the default model checker of MASs. Furthermore, we prove that although TCTLC extends CTL, its model checking algorithm remains polynomial (P-complete) with respect to the size of the model and the length of the formula. Similarly, the space complexity for concurrent programs also remains unchanged, which is polynomial (PSPACE-complete) with respect to the size of the components within these programs. Finally, to evaluate the proposed technique, we report the experimental results using an industrial case study and compare the results with those obtained on relevant benchmarks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"243","pagesFromTo":"1-10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6787a501fdbe8374ef2ec77e","6787a501fdbe8374ef2ec77f","6787a501fdbe8374ef2ec780","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c8b","mniswId":"6463","title":"Expert Systems with Applications","issn":"0957-4174","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f3a6d99e-402b-4782-953d-b20af6cf6650"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6787a501fdbe8374ef2ec77d","year":"2024","volume":"243","documentHash":"de330cec-1071-4412-963d-7c58debe8412"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Multi-Agent Systems","Verification","Model checking","Trust","Social commitments"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060352503"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6777ea1dfdbe833ec1cc9aea","name":"Anna","lastName":"Błażewicz","documentHash":"5c12ca85-1680-4b7d-9439-11668e1ebbe2"},{"objectId":"6777ea1dfdbe833ec1cc9ae9","name":"Wojciech Remington","lastName":"Dolliver","documentHash":"166cc59e-fe1e-4735-9ac3-e1c433769a12"},{"objectId":"6777ea1dfdbe833ec1cc9ae8","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Klatka","documentHash":"fbb60693-1b8e-4ecb-a6ca-8767405f221d"},{"objectId":"6777ea1dfdbe833ec1cc9ae7","name":"Maria","lastName":"Klatka","documentHash":"ff58ccb0-644c-4016-b53d-f76f4b854088"},{"objectId":"6777ea1dfdbe833ec1cc9ae6","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Mertowski","documentHash":"ada74ecc-af80-4806-b8ca-e8c1d9963660"},{"objectId":"6777ea1dfdbe833ec1cc9ae5","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Mertowska","documentHash":"cab7b9f1-baeb-42dd-ba75-26e294cd24af"},{"objectId":"6777ea1dfdbe833ec1cc9ae4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Hymos","documentHash":"8241f969-ae00-4f35-9e20-87ebb31d4143"},{"objectId":"6777ea1dfdbe833ec1cc9ae3","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Grywalska","documentHash":"1d7e80be-ac42-4a47-94d9-6a7051b71b32"},{"objectId":"6777ea1dfdbe833ec1cc9ae2","name":"Julia","lastName":"Wojnicka","documentHash":"373b5928-c27b-4f65-9a5b-8c7cadde1ded"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047396044","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Charytanowicz","uuid":"21B4690A4BBE001432456F66E7090F86CB9A837C1A26B40EAA0C92795E0BA562456C2700DB0D9818B093E02CA2212B006F27193FB57CEB42EABF419028D2AD15","orcidId":"0000-0002-1956-3941","documentHash":"a50ee15d-4d4a-422e-b630-ac83ca9abfde"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6777ea1dfdbe833ec1cc9ae1","doi":"10.3390/jcm13020511","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13020511","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The Relationship between Cancer Stage, Selected Immunological Parameters, Epstein–Barr Virus Infection, and Total Serum Content of Iron, Zinc, and Copper in Patients with Laryngeal Cancer","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"(1) Background: the purpose of the study was to assess the relationship between cancer stage, selected immunological parameters, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection, and total serum content of iron, zinc, and copper in patients with laryngeal cancer (LC).

Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed by flow cytometry using fluorescent antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD25, CD69, and PD-1. Tumor and lymph node lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. EBV DNA was quantified by real-time PCR, targeting the EBNA-1 gene. Associations between serum elements, immune markers, and cancer grade/stage were evaluated using ANOVA and appropriate nonparametric tests. (3) Results: levels of Fe, Cu, and Zn were lower, while Cu/Zn was statistically higher, in patients with LC than in the control group. Correlation analysis showed a statistically significant association between the levels of these elements and parameters of the TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) staging system, immunophenotype, and the amount of EBV genetic material in patients with LC who survived for more than 5 years.

This paper presents the design and implementation of a new open-source and scalable software tool for modeling and verifying intelligent applications with commitment and trust protocols under both uncertainty and inconsistency settings, using reduction-based multi-valued model checking techniques. The proposed tool is equipped with original and novel algorithms that transform our logics of multi-valued commitment (mv-CTLC) and multi-value trust (mv-TCTL) that we recently introduced to their classical two-valued commitment (CTLC) and trust (TCTL) logic versions as well as to Computational Tree Logic (CTL). Moreover, the tool transforms the mv-CTL to CTL, and it is applicable for the classical model checking by transforming the classical logics of trust and commitment to CTL. To demonstrate the practicality and applicability of the proposed tool in real settings, we present and report experimental results over two blockchain-based applications in the healthcare domain. Finally, we provide discussions and comparisons between the proposed approaches regarding scalability and efficiency. Moreover, we provide packages of more than 11 experiments, including the ones we conduct in this paper and enhanced experiments from previous works.

In the existing regression model based on polynomial neural networks (PNN), it is difficult to achieve high quality performance when predicting time series data, because this model lacks the ability to extract temporal and spatial information. Therefore, we propose a new architecture consisting of one LSTM (temporal) layer and several fuzzy polynomial (spatial) layers to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings of PNN and enhance its predictive ability to approximate the data. The temporal layer consists of LSTM neurons that have inherently strong modeling capabilities to learn sequential information. The spatial layers are composed of Rule-based Polynomial Neurons (FPNs) that can effectively reflect the complex nonlinear structure found in the input space and granulate it using of the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering method. An elitism-driven roulette-wheel selection (E_RWS) is used to select appropriate neurons. E_RWS not only ensures that the neuron with the strongest fitting ability is selected but also increases the diversity of candidate neurons.

Cyber-physical air and gas protection systems ensure operational safety. However, safeguarding methane sensors from unauthorized interference is a key issue. This research aims to develop an intelligent method for detecting disturbances in methane sensor operation, preventing mining emergencies. The methodological basis for achieving the research goal is an integrated approach using proven scientific methods: analysis of existing scientific and practical results; computer modeling, development, and creation of prototypes of computer-integrated stands for studying the processes of external influence on measurement results. The primary advantage of the proposed method is the software implementation of the specified approach on the existing computer-integrated modules and sensor hardware platform. This allows for the identification of unregulated modes of operation without the need for hardware redundancy during the implementation of measurement modules for information processing in cyber-physical systems. The structure of computer-aided monitoring with decision support has been substantiated and developed, which implements the mathematical apparatus of the proposed method for detecting unauthorized interference with sensor operation modes. The implementation of the developed method of detecting unauthorized interference in the regulated mode of the methane concentration sensor made it possible to detect such interference from 15 seconds, if the concentration is more than 1.45%, to 20 seconds during the action of the minimum methane concentration of 0.24%. The specified time interval from 15 to 20 seconds is approximately equal to the time constant of the transition process, which varies depending on the degree of tightness of its sensitive element."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2024","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-18","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677ff2bcfdbe831a91d9a0f9","677ff2bcfdbe831a91d9a0fa","5e709200878c28a04738e75e","677ff2bcfdbe831a91d9a0fb","677ff2bcfdbe831a91d9a0fc","677ff2bcfdbe831a91d9a0fd","677ff2bcfdbe831a91d9a0fe"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c791","mniswId":"10688","title":"Journal of Control Science and Engineering","issn":"1687-5249","eissn":"1687-5257","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"10922624-e956-4324-a1de-6a27850f19c8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677ff2bcfdbe831a91d9a0f8","year":"2024","volume":"2024","number":"1","documentHash":"342f5f06-f1fa-4806-a318-d4418eb6671c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Computer-Integrated Monitoring Technology","Unauthorized Disturbance","Coal Mines"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060378840"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678107c6fdbe834a810c25d8","name":"Muhammet","lastName":"Deveci","documentHash":"8728b81c-4715-4940-b16b-d659124d92b1"},{"objectId":"678107c6fdbe834a810c25d7","name":"Luka","lastName":"Jovanovic","documentHash":"767536a0-7100-479e-9a87-8e0f2c20f7c0"},{"objectId":"678107c6fdbe834a810c25d6","name":"Nebojsa","lastName":"Bacanin","documentHash":"f080924e-53be-4893-819c-282cb4acd870"},{"objectId":"678107c6fdbe834a810c25d5","name":"Miodrag","lastName":"Zivkovic","documentHash":"33666206-a779-42d4-8a0a-e741a482c01e"},{"objectId":"678107c6fdbe834a810c25d4","name":"Maja","lastName":"Kljajic","documentHash":"da141a4f-235c-451a-ae47-a885da58af80"},{"objectId":"678107c6fdbe834a810c25d3","name":"Vule","lastName":"Mizdrakovic","documentHash":"facc2eab-ba49-495e-8102-ce5b7f793b8e"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"678107c6fdbe834a810c25d1","doi":"10.1016/j.knosys.2024.112026","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2024.112026","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Forecasting bitcoin: Decomposition aided long short-term memory based time series modeling and its explanation with Shapley values","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bitcoin price volatility fascinates both researchers and investors, studying features that influence its movement. This paper expends on previous research and examines time series data of various exogenous and endogenous factors: Bitcoin, Ethereum, S&P 500, and VIX closing prices; exchange rates of the Euro and GPB to USD; and the number of Bitcoin-related tweets per day. A period of three years (from September 2019 to September 2022) is covered by the research dataset. A two-layer framework is introduced tasked with accurately forecasting Bitcoin price. In the first layer, to account for complexities in the analyzed data, variational mode decomposition (VMD) extracts trends from the time series. In the second layer, Long short-term memory and hybrid Bidirectional long short-term memory networks were used to forecast prices several steps ahead. This work also introduced an enhanced variant of the sine cosine algorithm to tune the control parameters of VMD and both neural networks for attaining the best possible performance. The main focus is on combining VMD with modified metaheuristics to improve cryptocurrency closing value forecast. Two sets of experiments were conducted, with and without VMD. The results have been contrasted with models tuned by seven other cutting-edge optimizers. Extensive experimental outcomes indicate that Bitcoin price can be forecasted with great accuracy using selected features and time series decomposition. Additionally, the best model was analyzed, and Shapley values indicated that features such as EUR/USD exchange rates, Ethereum closing prices, and GBP/USD exchange rates, have a significant impact on forecasts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"299","pagesFromTo":"1-22","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["678107c6fdbe834a810c25d3","678107c6fdbe834a810c25d4","678107c6fdbe834a810c25d5","678107c6fdbe834a810c25d6","678107c6fdbe834a810c25d7","678107c6fdbe834a810c25d8","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c3e","mniswId":"13330","title":"Knowledge-Based Systems","issn":"0950-7051","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c69b74f5-7df3-4f50-90c2-af810e823ba7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678107c6fdbe834a810c25d2","year":"2024","volume":"299","documentHash":"09babfac-b0a9-47bf-a85a-4818eb6e54e2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Investor sentiment","Variational mode decomposition","Bidirectional long short-term memory","Metaheuristics optimization","Sine cosine algorithm"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060385906"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678129ebfdbe834a8111ec89","name":"Shanlin","lastName":"Yang","documentHash":"f10eb49b-b685-4ba3-9017-befbf50cce82"},{"objectId":"678129ebfdbe834a8111ec88","name":"Xiaoan","lastName":"Tang","documentHash":"64294534-7cee-4315-a6bb-1f55568cdf09"},{"objectId":"678129ebfdbe834a8111ec87","name":"Qiang","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"f0936ac9-3571-4e21-bf7f-fcc20d65a57c"},{"objectId":"678129ebfdbe834a8111ec86","name":"Ting","lastName":"Huang","documentHash":"bd811f28-6b13-4e25-99b3-82a3753c1b56"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"678129ebfdbe834a8111ec84","doi":"10.1016/j.ejor.2024.04.017","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2024.04.017","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Constructing order-2 information granules of linguistic expressions with the aid of the principle of justifiable granularity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"To capture collective opinions/evaluations in a collection of individual linguistic expressions, this study proposes an approach to construct order-2 information granules by extending the numerical data-based principles of justifiable granularity to a linguistic data-based one. First, the two key criteria of the principle of justifiable granularity, namely coverage and specificity, are formally defined in the context of order-2 information granules. Second, three order-2 information granules construction models by maximizing the product of coverage and specificity are developed for coping with one-dimensional direct linguistic expressions, linguistic preference relations, and multi-dimensional direct linguistic expressions, respectively. Third, considering that the developed order-2 information granules construction models exhibit a non-linear uncertain objective function and equality constraints, the constrained multi-swarm PSO without velocity is improved with the use of the ε constrained handling technique for effectively solving the models. Case studies on the considered three types of linguistic expressions show the applicability of the proposed models and ensuing algorithm. The superiority of the improved algorithm in handling the proposed models is demonstrated by comparison with the original one. The effectiveness of the proposed models in terms of abnormal corrective ability and balance of coverage and specificity is verified by comparing with a family of Top-n methods. The originality of this study lies in the construction of an operational entity, namely order-2 information granule, that reflects the group opinion without specifying the formalism of individual linguistic expressions, which provides an effective and efficient way to aggregate ubiquitous linguistic information for subsequent computation, reasoning and decision-making."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"318","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"892-910","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["678129ebfdbe834a8111ec86","5e70922b878c28a047391011","678129ebfdbe834a8111ec87","678129ebfdbe834a8111ec88","678129ebfdbe834a8111ec89"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477bd5","mniswId":"6227","title":"European Journal of Operational Research","issn":"0377-2217","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b3802d49-6884-4b53-a61e-73091e9f83b5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678129ebfdbe834a8111ec85","year":"2024","volume":"318","number":"3","documentHash":"9d3f6c1d-7ebf-400e-a95e-89570e5b641a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Computing with words","Order-2 information granule","Justifiable granularity","Linguistic preference relations"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060385931"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62d001ab4097075e7c6fa6d2","name":"Michael","lastName":"Gonzalez","documentHash":"300d3230-cbe3-43fe-ae18-941f6041fa99"},{"objectId":"5f1655427523405869ccc2e9","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Miebs","uuid":"5350DEC007E81AACE1B889E6355788CF21C906C427340AA0B3CA886FAF07E8257FAA3F3CA88CD439EDD8C1C354904EB66C2A4004ABDB76D28C1E011A805AF3F4","orcidId":"0000-0002-0628-6949","documentHash":"a43b35f5-cbc7-4235-abcd-f21bd0e3698f"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6da1","name":"Marco","lastName":"Cinelli","uuid":"264B4EBD44FA082C58B768668281754F275D30CB51DED850EB239FB095360495D11C6D3318C8382ABFAE6AB2FEE07404C34A2534610F0C93C22E2E5F68F49329","documentHash":"3d8d348d-3b53-41f5-8547-4a7391cd7768"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aea7f","name":"Miłosz","lastName":"Kadziński","uuid":"0524DF351F74037796D121D8BF7C1CCA9249345518F29DDEB1C65535048C6204A5AB8E4891A0339577E7CFC30BE45B0CC495E2F95ABE4BDB1176AA365686E5F0","orcidId":"0000-0003-1806-3715","documentHash":"1bcbca85-e703-4477-a88a-b45166e29063"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396da0","name":"Roman","lastName":"Słowiński","uuid":"AB1926BA4A9DED93AC177661DD774526EC689F9DEA2576B69B9B01761B4609D2F2C87038A8C688867E5CD6EEB89BA0B69AD7A7B241DEE418C47FC2A66DD1E1ED","orcidId":"0000-0002-5200-7795","documentHash":"cc5ad471-bd5b-46b0-bade-7f464a803b0c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62d001ab4097075e7c6fa6cc","doi":"10.1016/j.ejor.2022.01.011","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221722000297","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Recommending multiple criteria decision analysis methods with a new taxonomy-based decision support system","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present a new methodology to lead the selection of Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods.

With the in-depth research and expansion of CCL in scopes, goals, and methodologies, some difficulties have gradually emerged, including some vague terminology, ambiguous views, and scattered research. Hence, a systematic and comprehensive review of the development process and advanced research about CCL is particularly necessary at the moment. This paper summarizes the theoretical significance, application value, and future development potential of CCL. More importantly, by synthesizing the reviewed related research, we can acquire some interesting results and answer three essential questions: (1) why examine a cognitive and learning framework based on concept?

MI-BCIs have garnered increasing attention from researchers in the field of motor function rehabilitation as a healthcare technology. However, the variability of inter-session and the difficulty in extracting energy features bring huge challenges to the information processing of such systems. To overcome this, we propose a novel architecture called SecNet, designed to capture relationships between convolutional features. SecNet utilizes multiple branches to learn spatio-temporal features of EEG signals and then pools them into a covariance. We integrate regularization and attention mechanisms to enhance the learning efficiency of features, followed by the adoption of a second order pooling method. Lastly, we employ Riemannian geometry learning to map features derived from symmetric positive definite covariance matrices. Evaluation experiments are conducted on a dataset from stroke patients and further compared its performance on two public datasets. Experimental results show that the SecNet is superior to the benchmark methods and achieves accuracy rates of 72.90%, 87.08% and 74.28% on the Stroke dataset, BCI IV 2a dataset and OpenBMI dataset, respectively. These results demonstrate its efficacy and robustness in inter-session decoding for MI-BCI, showing its practical utility for application.

The proposed method is versatile, applicable to a broad range of deep structures and other machine learning architectures. The key to its effectiveness is the conversion of original data into a streaming sequence, which is then fed into the neural network structure. To monitor the learning process and prevent overfitting, a drift detector, commonly used in stream data mining, is employed. Additionally, two methods, ELB and ENT, are introduced to prioritize problematic data elements during the learning process, enhancing overall model performance. Extensive simulations on benchmark datasets (MNIST and CIFAR) validate that BBATDD achieves higher accuracy with significantly fewer batches, without sacrificing generalization capability. For instance, when applied to the MNIST dataset and processing 10 000 batches while comparing loss function values, our approach demonstrates a remarkable 45.6% improvement."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"669","pagesFromTo":"1-15","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["672b6fb6fdbe8307b05721d7","6545baba40e3ff4ef3f3fe7a","5e709200878c28a04738e75e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d5","mniswId":"8327","title":"Information Sciences","issn":"0020-0255","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4163795f-444a-41b6-b172-a0bdb2570867"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677fec30fdbe831a91d96645","year":"2024","volume":"669","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"477ff7de-f65e-475a-a919-8c8bed3cab27"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Deep neural network","Streaming processing","Data sampling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060426927"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677f7e63fdbe831a383ea5ab","name":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Chena","documentHash":"f64c84a2-4c9e-4067-b3d8-a4a8b96004f4"},{"objectId":"677f7e63fdbe831a383ea5aa","name":"Zaiwu","lastName":"Gong","documentHash":"136310d4-0054-42f8-9bbc-0923dfa39932"},{"objectId":"677f7e63fdbe831a383ea5a9","name":"Kun","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"da065938-8ae1-4197-be6f-054e93d533a6"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396da0","name":"Roman","lastName":"Słowiński","uuid":"AB1926BA4A9DED93AC177661DD774526EC689F9DEA2576B69B9B01761B4609D2F2C87038A8C688867E5CD6EEB89BA0B69AD7A7B241DEE418C47FC2A66DD1E1ED","orcidId":"0000-0002-5200-7795","documentHash":"cc5ad471-bd5b-46b0-bade-7f464a803b0c"}],"objectId":"677f7e63fdbe831a383ea5a7","doi":"10.1007/s10726-024-09883-z","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10726-024-09883-z","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Determination of a representative collective value function through a value function-based consensus-reaching process","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Consensus-reaching among decision-makers (DMs) is an important prerequisite for effective group decision-making. Determining a collective value function that is recognized by major DMs is new in consensus research. We are approaching this problem by adopting the preference disaggregation analysis (PDA) to construct a novel consensus-reaching process (CRP). More precisely, we define the value function that can restore the preference information of all DMs as the consensus value function, and determine all such value functions by the PDA method. A consensus discriminant model is constructed to determine whether DMs can reach a consensus. Considering the adjustment cost of DMs, the minimum cost consensus model, and the minimum cost inconsistency elimination model, are constructed by introducing estimation errors and 0–1 variables, respectively, thus assisting DMs to reach a consensus. Furthermore, in the process of selecting a representative collective value function from the consensus space for subsequent decision analysis, a lexicographic optimization process is applied to convert the multi-objective programming problem of DMs’ individual requirements for the collective value function into a multi-stage single-objective programming problem. This study provides a new concept of consensus and extends the classic minimum cost consensus model to the case of value functions. Finally, an illustrative example showing the proposed CRP in action is presented, while conducting sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of parameter changes on the model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396da0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396da0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1089 - 1113","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677f7e63fdbe831a383ea5a9","677f7e63fdbe831a383ea5aa","677f7e63fdbe831a383ea5ab","5e709281878c28a047396da0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e7c","mniswId":"7344","title":"Group Decision and Negotiation","issn":"0926-2644","eissn":"1572-9907","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"1970f8cd-bcc7-4331-8e19-b465daaffd90"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677f7e63fdbe831a383ea5a8","year":"2024","volume":"33","number":"5","documentHash":"cae8cc2c-bda7-418a-a943-ca4e5a6acc8d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Group decision-making","Preference disaggregation analysis","Consensus-reaching processes","Consensus space","Representative collective value function"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060430423"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5ce7","name":"Péter","lastName":"Rakyta","documentHash":"49e54fe7-c326-4f1c-8551-5445bbd29cb2"},{"objectId":"6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5ce6","name":"Zoltán","lastName":"Zimborás","documentHash":"676e8029-4845-4377-ae42-d07a78da8576"},{"objectId":"6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5ce4","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Mencer","documentHash":"895094f0-06d8-44bd-96fd-2b8a2d656c9a"},{"objectId":"6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5ce3","name":"Tamás","lastName":"Kozsik","documentHash":"988b3bae-b2eb-4295-ac8f-11b2e73dd3f5"},{"objectId":"6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5ce2","name":"Uroš","lastName":"Stojčić","documentHash":"e1ad6b76-0833-4020-9534-ce14cf937991"},{"objectId":"6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5ce1","name":"Zoltán","lastName":"Kolarovszki","documentHash":"c5fa8cf9-5393-4b3a-8b64-75e4990623b5"},{"objectId":"6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5ce0","name":"Ágoston","lastName":"Kaposi","documentHash":"36de5177-74b6-4cc2-9094-d3c658ea16d3"},{"objectId":"6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5cdf","name":"Gregory","lastName":"Morse","documentHash":"63e3e9e7-566d-482d-8138-d1f464b906b4"},{"objectId":"5e709352878c28a0473a72a5","name":"Michał","lastName":"Oszmaniec","uuid":"93BCA83A52CC970812777EF1009A06EFA1BF261D549A394974D04AF0C17502D73F7A8A4FE43A27362F8EFEB89F1232D65E2200E0E698F6B7C14FF587634D31BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-4946-6835","documentHash":"1e6a92a0-c6d3-4b88-a054-55d9c193d06e"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0ec6","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Rybotycki","uuid":"897C50FD08D1E1C7E1D847E52E6B17284720DE16A905746C4FC31F35D1B1A20C8A6687DCBB6B343C4180F783FE2135C4D836F4938A191BE1C5CD6963ACDB5441","orcidId":"0000-0003-2493-0459","documentHash":"409ac0d1-bcc9-40c6-ad2f-00edeeea1141"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5cde","doi":"10.1088/1367-2630/ad313b","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ad313b","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"High performance Boson sampling simulation via data-flow engines","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Boson sampling (BS) is viewed to be an accessible quantum computing paradigm to demonstrate computational advantage compared to classical computers. In this context, the evolution of permanent calculation algorithms attracts a significant attention as the simulation of BS experiments involves the evaluation of vast number of permanents. For this reason, we generalize the Balasubramanian–Bax–Franklin–Glynn permanent formula, aiming to efficiently integrate it into the BS strategy of Clifford and Clifford (2020 Faster classical boson sampling). A reduction in simulation complexity originating from multiplicities in photon occupation was achieved through the incorporation of a n-ary Gray code ordering of the addends during the permanent evaluation. Implementing the devised algorithm on FPGA-based data-flow engines, we leverage the resulting tool to accelerate boson sampling simulations for up to 40 photons. Drawing samples from a 60-mode interferometer, the achieved rate averages around 80 s per sample, employing 4 FPGA chips. The developed design facilitates the simulation of both ideal and lossy boson sampling experiments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709301878c28a0473a0ec6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709190878c28a04737e97e","uid":"bWWUVYe-Cljroqid25B6Vkw","uuid":"eff87f52-7504-44aa-aabc-f524f64383f5","name":"Centrum Fizyki Teoretycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709352878c28a0473a72a5"],"parentId":"5e709190878c28a04737e97e","parentUuid":"eff87f52-7504-44aa-aabc-f524f64383f5","rootId":"5e709190878c28a04737e97e","rootUuid":"eff87f52-7504-44aa-aabc-f524f64383f5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1-17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5cdf","5e709301878c28a0473a0ec6","6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5ce0","6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5ce1","6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5ce2","6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5ce3","6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5ce4","5e709352878c28a0473a72a5","6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5ce6","6777c442fdbe833ec1ca5ce7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479023","mniswId":"15036","title":"New Journal of Physics","issn":"1367-2630","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"66969f49-7e62-40fc-8f5b-e34e5e75d259"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67519099fdbe834f76843643","year":"2024","volume":"26","number":"3","documentHash":"5df044a0-b1ef-43a1-9e22-20cb8441d147"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["boson sampling simulation","FPGA","permanent","data-flow","lossy boson sampling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060434099"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66ebfe35fdbe8327376b3e79","name":"JinDe","lastName":"Cao","documentHash":"a344767f-72eb-499a-9409-8c48455e7b1d"},{"objectId":"66ebfe35fdbe8327376b3e78","name":"Chengdai","lastName":"Huang","documentHash":"9280e9fa-c6c2-487c-b1b6-ecc05e28e20d"},{"objectId":"66ebfe35fdbe8327376b3e77","name":"Min","lastName":"Xiao","documentHash":"d837a302-d06f-49c8-975b-fb0ca30f61fd"},{"objectId":"66ebfe35fdbe8327376b3e76","name":"Yawen","lastName":"Ju","documentHash":"66e46630-de1e-42e2-8f66-82f1fbd38a66"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e75e","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"A56F3A8C2F6246587B88982FE48FEA2855A7B5222539A126265F1D882510368FD87B8932975E7451D01686982B7D3158DA885EF3F5FFA39E4B9D9EE6FD22470F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6960-9525","documentHash":"715a0529-c457-4823-a66d-ee6bebb7dd83"}],"objectId":"66ebfe35fdbe8327376b3e75","doi":"10.1080/00207721.2024.2337899","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00207721.2024.2337899","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Hybrid control of Turing instability and bifurcation for spatial-temporal propagation of computer virus","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this era of information technology, information leakage and file corruption due to computer virus intrusion have been serious issues. How to detect and prevent the spread of the computer virus is the major challenge we are facing now. To target this problem, a class of virus propagation models with hybrid control scheme are formulated to investigate the dynamic evolution and prevention from a spatial-temporal perspective in this paper. Diffusion-induced Turing instability is detected in response to the computer virus propagation. The introduction of hybrid control scheme can effective suppress Turing instability and turn the propagation system back to a stable state. And then, the time delay is selected as the bifurcation parameter. If the time delay exceeds the bifurcation threshold, the propagation will be destabilised and a Hopf bifurcation will occur. The hybrid control tactic can not only regulate the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation well, but also optimise the properties of bifurcating period solutions. In the end, the correctness and validity of the theoretical results are verified via numerical simulations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"55","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"2187-2210","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66ebfe35fdbe8327376b3e76","66ebfe35fdbe8327376b3e77","66ebfe35fdbe8327376b3e78","5e709200878c28a04738e75e","66ebfe35fdbe8327376b3e79"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454782e9","mniswId":"9414","title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE","issn":"0020-7721","eissn":"1464-5319","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"726f2f9d-0228-40a4-bb6d-e1bbfc4c21c2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6787b761fdbe8374ef310767","year":"2024","volume":"55","number":"11","doi":"","documentHash":"cb36508f-1dfb-4d91-a359-31276b34ce5a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Computer virus propagation system","hybrid control","spatial diffusion","time delays","Turing instability","Hopf bifurcation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060436651"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6780f38ffdbe834a81098326","name":"Jin-De 进德","lastName":"Cao 曹","documentHash":"fb74c36e-b09a-4914-b45f-4780a8c9d02f"},{"objectId":"6780f38ffdbe834a81098325","name":"Xia 霞","lastName":"Huang 黄","documentHash":"be87482d-a5a4-422b-a856-6700e15d3050"},{"objectId":"6780f38ffdbe834a81098324","name":"Hai-Bo 海波","lastName":"Bao 包","documentHash":"89acfb78-9687-4bd2-ae6f-94e0efc8624d"},{"objectId":"6780f38ffdbe834a81098323","name":"Min 敏","lastName":"Xiao 肖","documentHash":"20a9f3d0-6608-4603-ad8d-fd9dba7afe13"},{"objectId":"6780f38ffdbe834a81098322","name":"Xi-Xi 习习","lastName":"Huang 黄","documentHash":"10989ee6-2e72-4386-81d2-e02959a1d05e"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e75e","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"A56F3A8C2F6246587B88982FE48FEA2855A7B5222539A126265F1D882510368FD87B8932975E7451D01686982B7D3158DA885EF3F5FFA39E4B9D9EE6FD22470F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6960-9525","documentHash":"715a0529-c457-4823-a66d-ee6bebb7dd83"}],"objectId":"6780f38ffdbe834a81098320","doi":"10.1088/1674-1056/ad24d5","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-1056/ad24d5","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Mechanism analysis of regulating Turing instability and Hopf bifurcation of malware propagation in mobile wireless sensor networks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A dynamical model is constructed to depict the spatial-temporal evolution of malware in mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs).

Numerical simulation results show that the hybrid control strategy can efficiently manipulate the transmission dynamics to achieve our expected desired properties, thus reducing the harm of malware propagation to MWSNs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1-17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6780f38ffdbe834a81098322","6780f38ffdbe834a81098323","5e709200878c28a04738e75e","6780f38ffdbe834a81098324","6780f38ffdbe834a81098325","6780f38ffdbe834a81098326"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477643","mniswId":"3637","title":"Chinese Physics B","issn":"1674-1056","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"d90d2d34-865e-4147-999d-33ce3e933e43"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6780f38ffdbe834a81098321","year":"2024","volume":"33","number":"6","documentHash":"ce044b81-2a51-4f1c-84f3-fb9cd8e1a6fe"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mobile wireless sensor networks","reaction-diffusion","Hopf bifurcation","hybrid control"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060436717"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6787815ffdbe8374ef2a5457","name":"Dragan","lastName":"Pamučar","documentHash":"93e27213-86a0-42bc-8a1d-3dcd8affa3c9"},{"objectId":"6787815ffdbe8374ef2a5456","name":"Muhammet","lastName":"Deveci","documentHash":"09607492-3b17-4131-a2ea-6bf411691b30"},{"objectId":"6787815ffdbe8374ef2a5455","name":"Zhe","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"e47bfbcd-f6e0-423e-a422-112089f4d13b"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"OCTOBER","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"6787815ffdbe8374ef2a5453","doi":"10.1016/j.inffus.2024.102458","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2024.102458","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"An effective multi-source data fusion approach based on -divergence in belief functions theory with applications to air target recognition and fault diagnosis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Belief functions theory (BFT) plays a critical role in addressing uncertainty and imprecision in multi-source data fusion. Unfortunately, the application of Dempster’s rule in BFT often produces unexpected and counterintuitive results when it encounters highly conflicting evidence.

We further present two symmetric versions of enhanced belief -divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed symmetric divergences exhibit key properties including non-negativity, non-degeneracy and symmetry. Also, we analyze that the proposed symmetric divergences can be converted to divergence, Jeffreys divergence, Hellinger distance, Jensen–Shannon divergence and arithmetic–geometric divergence under the framework of BFT in some special cases. Leveraging the proposed symmetric divergences, a novel multi-source data fusion approach is proposed, which evaluates the credibility and informational volume of each evidence, offering a more nuanced understanding of their significance. To validate the proposed approach, we apply it to air target recognition and fault diagnosis scenarios, where our proposed approach showcases superior performance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"110","pagesFromTo":"1-25","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6787815ffdbe8374ef2a5455","6787815ffdbe8374ef2a5456","6787815ffdbe8374ef2a5457","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d0","mniswId":"8320","title":"Information Fusion","issn":"1566-2535","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c64b5410-c718-42f9-9f6b-d517eb0fed3e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6787815ffdbe8374ef2a5454","year":"2024","volume":"110","documentHash":"5baa2dcc-8b23-4305-be4d-bfe25c0ae3c6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["α-divergence","Belief α-divergence","Belief functions theory","Belief entropy","Multi-source data fusion"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060436747"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6780e005fdbe834a8107086d","name":"Jie","lastName":"Ding","documentHash":"7e716399-5255-48e7-8a68-4a63bcab55e1"},{"objectId":"6780e005fdbe834a8107086c","name":"Yifeng","lastName":"Luan","documentHash":"18641cda-318a-4057-95e6-51f7ff59f432"},{"objectId":"6780e005fdbe834a8107086b","name":"Min","lastName":"Xiao","documentHash":"04b7b9e5-e980-44c7-ba98-642c1fd02f2b"},{"objectId":"6780e005fdbe834a8107086a","name":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Du","documentHash":"6c12a019-ba32-4da3-ac03-6ce70691d6e4"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e75e","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"A56F3A8C2F6246587B88982FE48FEA2855A7B5222539A126265F1D882510368FD87B8932975E7451D01686982B7D3158DA885EF3F5FFA39E4B9D9EE6FD22470F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6960-9525","documentHash":"715a0529-c457-4823-a66d-ee6bebb7dd83"}],"objectId":"6780e005fdbe834a81070868","doi":"10.1115/1.4065881","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4065881","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Full-Dimensional Proportional-Derivative Control Technique for Turing Pattern and Bifurcation of Delayed Reaction-Diffusion Bidirectional Ring Neural Networks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In neural networks, the states of neural networks often exhibit significant spatio-temporal heterogeneity due to the diffusion effect of electrons and differences in the concentration of neurotransmitters. One of the macroscopic reflections of this time-spatial inhomogeneity is Turing pattern. However, most current research in reaction-diffusion neural networks has focused only on one-dimensional location information, and the remaining results considering two-dimensional location information are still limited to the case of two neurons. In this paper, we conduct the dynamic analysis and optimal control of a delayed reaction-diffusion neural network model with bidirectional loop structure. First, several mathematical descriptions are given for the proposed neural network model and the full-dimensional partial differential proportional-derivative (PD) controller is introduced. Second, by analyzing the characteristic equation, the conditions for Hopf bifurcation and Turing instability of the controlled network model are obtained. Furthermore, the amplitude equation of the controlled neural network is obtained based on the multiscale analysis method. Subsequently, we determine the key parameters affecting the formation of Turing pattern depending on the amplitude equation. Finally, multiple sets of computer simulations are carried out to support our theoretical results. It is found that the diffusion coefficients and time delays have significant effects on spatio-temporal dynamics of neural networks. Moreover, after reasonable parameter proportioning, the full-dimensional PD control method can alleviate the spatial heterogeneity caused by diffusion projects and time delays."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6780e005fdbe834a8107086a","6780e005fdbe834a8107086b","6780e005fdbe834a8107086c","6780e005fdbe834a8107086d","5e709200878c28a04738e75e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454785af","mniswId":"10608","title":"Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics","issn":"1555-1423","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"a72d088d-ef51-4fb3-8a29-15b57ce749ad"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6780e005fdbe834a81070869","year":"2024","volume":"19","number":"9","documentHash":"deb92fbe-8322-4ac4-8b7e-8a0cd2f03d13"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["neural network","reaction-diffusion","full-dimensional PD controller","turing instability","turing pattern","Hopf bifurcation","multiple time delays"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060436900"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e2d","name":"Wen-Long","lastName":"Shang","documentHash":"a4fbfdb9-d9f3-41f0-b5cc-cbbd6dfaada9"},{"objectId":"6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e2c","name":"Muhammet","lastName":"Deveci","documentHash":"cd6169d9-eec9-4537-9825-0d8073ed997c"},{"objectId":"6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e2b","name":"Radek","lastName":"Martinek","documentHash":"1265c90a-3179-4977-abf1-9cf76f3f0b6c"},{"objectId":"6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e2a","name":"Jan","lastName":"Nedoma","documentHash":"2aa942e1-78bb-4135-8a89-18778897c4a7"},{"objectId":"6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e29","name":"Mayas","lastName":"Aljibawi","documentHash":"dd6b8332-f02e-48f4-903c-d39a1178e841"},{"objectId":"6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e28","name":"Mazin Abed","lastName":"Mohammed","documentHash":"bf0069c4-06d4-4d6c-aa88-aee64bebb695"},{"objectId":"6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e27","name":"Mohammed Ahmed","lastName":"Subhi","documentHash":"898c5630-fadf-4951-8ce2-5e05b0eb46d7"},{"objectId":"6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e26","name":"Karrar Hameed","lastName":"Abdulkareem","documentHash":"cc2333ea-78ec-425e-8e91-1e270425dbd7"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"JUNE","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e25","doi":"10.1016/j.engappai.2024.107926","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2024.107926","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A manifold intelligent decision system for fusion and benchmarking of deep waste-sorting models","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Increases in population and prosperity are linked to a worldwide rise in garbage. The “classification” and “recycling” of solid waste is a crucial tactic for dealing with the waste problem. This paper presents a new two-layer intelligent decision system for waste sorting based on fused features of Deep Learning (DL) models as well as a selection of an optimal deep Waste-Sorting Model (WSM) based on Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). A dataset comprising 1451 samples of images of waste, distributed across four classes – cardboard (403), glass (501), metal (410), and general trash (137), was used for sorting. This study proposes a Multi-Fused Decision Matrix (MFDM) based on identified fusion score level rules, evaluation criteria, and deep fused waste-sorting models. Five fusion rules used in the sorting process and the evaluation perspectives into the MFDM are sum, weighted sum, product, maximum, and minimum rules. Additionally, each of entropy and Visekriterijumska Optimizacija i Kompromisno Resenje in Serbian (VIKOR) methods was used for weighting selected criteria as well as ranking deep WSMs. The highest accuracy rate of 98% was scored by ResNet50-GoogleNet- Inception based on the minimum rule. However, under the same rule, an insufficient accuracy rate of sorting was presented by ResNet50-GoogleNet-Xception. Since Qi = 0 for Inception-Xception, the final output based on MCDM methods indicates that the fused Inception-Xception model outperforms the other fused deep WSMs, which achieved the lowest values of Qi. Thus, Inception-Xception was chosen as the best deep waste-sorting model based on images of waste, multiple evaluation criteria, and different fusion perspectives. The mean and standard deviation metrics were both used to validate the selection findings objectively. The suggested approach can aid urban decision-makers in prioritizing and choosing an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-optimized optimal sorting model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"132","pagesFromTo":"1-15","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e26","6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e27","6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e28","6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e29","6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e2a","6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e2b","6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e2c","6788d0e5fdbe8373455f4e2d","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477abd","mniswId":"5708","title":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","issn":"0952-1976","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"19ed2b1b-ccc4-460e-b276-71b61c0ab49b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65dd85ea40970770918f3e5e","year":"2024","volume":"132","documentHash":"66b8ebc4-559f-4b7e-a860-0c4411b6de68"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fusion","Benchmarking","Deep learning","Inception-xception","Waste sorting","Entropy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060443980"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678125dafdbe834a8111ace7","name":"Ahmed","lastName":"Elwhishi","documentHash":"efa45bb6-53a9-41c3-ba0a-e670e6e2ae0a"},{"objectId":"678125dafdbe834a8111ace6","name":"Jamal","lastName":"Bentahar","documentHash":"b83d1518-3ff9-4b99-9154-cea732dbb9ad"},{"objectId":"678125dafdbe834a8111ace5","name":"Ghalya","lastName":"Alwhishi","documentHash":"6cd286fa-9800-4b86-9e50-1e1616914041"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"678125dafdbe834a8111ace3","doi":"10.1016/j.inffus.2024.102502","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2024.102502","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Multi-valued verification of commitment systems with uncertainty and inconsistency in multi-source data settings","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the dynamic landscape of Internet of Things (IoT) applications within multi-source data environments, ensuring the reliability and correctness of system communications has become a paramount concern. This is particularly evident in the presence of commitment protocols with inconsistency and uncertainty. This paper tackles these challenges by introducing a new logic, termed Six-Values Computation Tree Logic for Commitment (6V-CTLC), specifically crafted to adeptly model IoT systems with both inconsistency and uncertainty. Employing this logic, we devise an innovative reduction-based multi-valued model checking approach to verify the systems under scrutiny. Our method is implemented through a Java transformation tool we developed to translate the 6V-CTLC logic to the classical logic of commitment (CTLC) and seamlessly interfaces with the efficient model checker MCMAS+. Applying this approach, we verify an abstracted 6V-CTLC model featuring uncertainty and inconsistency, as well as the original model of our system before abstraction. Furthermore, we assess the scalability of our approach through ten experiments, comparing the results obtained from verifying the two models. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of system abstraction in mitigating the state explosion problem, while the developed multi-valued model checking technique yields precise results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"111","pagesFromTo":"1-18","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["678125dafdbe834a8111ace5","678125dafdbe834a8111ace6","678125dafdbe834a8111ace7","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d0","mniswId":"8320","title":"Information Fusion","issn":"1566-2535","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c64b5410-c718-42f9-9f6b-d517eb0fed3e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678125dafdbe834a8111ace4","year":"2024","volume":"111","documentHash":"2a853d28-389d-4e3e-b610-f34d2d02f4c2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Multi-valued model checking","IoTs","Commitment protocols","Lattice-valued logics","Uncertainty and inconsistency"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060447704"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6788fd6cfdbe8373456467ac","name":"Renjie","lastName":"He","documentHash":"d8aef24d-9fb7-4c5c-af19-6dc25e02f0bd"},{"objectId":"6788fd6cfdbe8373456467ab","name":"Yanjie","lastName":"Song","documentHash":"cb1d373a-41fd-4192-91c0-fafd61021807"},{"objectId":"6788fd6cfdbe8373456467aa","name":"Feng","lastName":"Yao","documentHash":"229d73c9-1df2-452c-93c8-3a811cb68189"},{"objectId":"6788fd6cfdbe8373456467a9","name":"Tao","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"f40572db-c8da-4b1e-9d61-32e81481728d"},{"objectId":"6788fd6cfdbe8373456467a8","name":"Jiamin","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"6baf8c76-503c-4f58-baeb-301f44055a8c"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"6788fd6cfdbe8373456467a7","doi":"10.1016/j.engappai.2023.107306","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2023.107306","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Assessing growth potential of careers with occupational mobility network and ensemble framework","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The growth potential of a career reflects its future prospects and is an important consideration for individuals and organizations when career planning. There is still a lack of quantitative assessment tools for growth potential of careers. In this study, considering the key role of human capital in human resource management, as well as the excellent performance of complex network and machine learning in big data analysis and prediction, a career growth potential assessment model with human capital ensemble is proposed through human capital-based occupational mobility network and ensemble learning. First, an occupational mobility network is constructed based on online professional dataset to associate occupations with each other. Then, five dimensions of human capital measurements are designed to quantify human capital in terms of education, experience, social capital, occupational size, and concentration. These are then combined with the occupational mobility network to create a new network that depicts human capital flows among occupations. Finally, an ensemble framework for assessing career growth potential is constructed to integrate multidimensional human capital information in the network and obtain quantitative scores of growth potential. This study is the original attempt to adopt a data-driven idea and an intelligent approach to understand career growth potential. The experimental results show that it also makes a useful exploration for modeling human capital flows and intelligent assessment of career prospects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"127","pagesFromTo":"1-15","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6788fd6cfdbe8373456467a8","6788fd6cfdbe8373456467a9","6788fd6cfdbe8373456467aa","5e70922b878c28a047391011","6788fd6cfdbe8373456467ab","6788fd6cfdbe8373456467ac"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477abd","mniswId":"5708","title":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","issn":"0952-1976","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"19ed2b1b-ccc4-460e-b276-71b61c0ab49b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6788fb6afdbe837345638c23","year":"2024","volume":"127","documentHash":"9c218de9-c5b6-43da-85ef-2bdbc24ca56e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Human capital","Occupational mobility network","Growth potential of career","Machine learning"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060449748"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6788d5cdfdbe8373455fcb8d","name":"Kaoru","lastName":"Hirota","documentHash":"7ac56d60-dae9-411f-a0b3-e4bf8404d107"},{"objectId":"6788d5cdfdbe8373455fcb8c","name":"Hesheng","lastName":"Huang","documentHash":"859c7164-59a0-47a9-aec5-aa66c32b07d8"},{"objectId":"6788d5cdfdbe8373455fcb8b","name":"Fei","lastName":"Yan","documentHash":"dd051a1a-a2a5-4708-a7cc-ce60abaeb099"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"6788d5cdfdbe8373455fcb89","doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2023.111123","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2023.111123","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A disease diagnosis system for smart healthcare based on fuzzy clustering and battle royale optimization","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The ongoing growth of the Internet of Things and machine learning technology have provided increased motivation for the development of smart healthcare.

First, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator is employed for determining key input variables of the model, and an automatic fuzzy clustering framework is used to automatically identify multiple operating modes. Then, a relevance vector machine with hybrid kernel method is presented to model each operating mode separately. Meanwhile, considering the problem of incomplete input and output data, data augmentation is applied in modeling to enhance the model performance. Finally, the soft sensing model of is formed.

With the ultimate purpose of answering this question, spatial differences are analysed of excess mortality for the first time at such a detailed spatial scale in Europe. As it is known, according to current knowledge, a strong increase in coronavirus disease-2019 mortality occurred in Lombardy, Italy, from about mid-March (Week 11–12 of 2020), followed by Spain and Belgium. It was decided, in the context of the present study, to see if similarly strong mortality anomalies, not assigned to this factor, were not present earlier. This could constitute circumstantial evidence that SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was present in Europe on a much larger scale earlier than it is commonly believed. The study, therefore, looks at whether there were local outbreaks of elevated deaths between November 2019 and March 2020. The analysis used available Eurostat data for 34 European countries according to the NUTS1, NUTS2 and NUTS3 divisions based on 918 units with more than 100,000 inhabitants. The number of deaths was analysed over consecutive 24 weeks of autumn–winter (7 October 2019–22 March 2020, i.e., W41-2019 to W12-2020) and were compared with the respective data for the 3-year reference period 2016–2018. The method used identifies geographically concentrated areas with excess deaths over short periods relative to the reference period. It was shown that 44 regions between W41-2019 and W08-2020 (i.e., before February 23) had elevated mortality (115% or more relative to the reference period). In the 44 NUTS3 regions mentioned, excess deaths during the autumn–winter period amounted to 96,000–126,000 when compared with the 2016–2018 baseline period (mainly in Spain, France, Italy, United Kingdom). It cannot be excluded that to some extent this could have been due to SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections. To confirm or deny this more clearly, detailed studies of the recorded causes of death in the indicated 44 regions are needed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaa","uid":"bIVuXx-j3MA3vg5GttGgoow","uuid":"7688bf94-399f-4567-854e-220f826816fb","name":"Instytut Geografii i Przestrzennego Zagospodarowania im.

Most event related potential-based BCI applications make use of decoding models, which requires training. This training process is often time-consuming and inconvenient for new users. In recent years, deep learning models, especially participant-independent models, have garnered significant attention in the domain of ERP classification. However, individual differences in EEG signals hamper model generalization, as the ERP component and other aspects of the EEG signal vary across participants, even when they are exposed to the same stimuli. This paper proposes a novel One-source domain transfer learning method based Attention Domain Adversarial Neural Network (OADANN) to mitigate data distribution discrepancies for cross-participant classification tasks. We train and validate our proposed model on both a publicly available OpenBMI dataset and a Self-collected dataset, employing a leave one participant out cross validation scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed OADANN method achieves the highest and most robust classification performance and exhibits significant improvements when compared to baseline methods (CNN, EEGNet, ShallowNet, DeepCovNet) and domain generalization methods (ERM, Mixup, and Groupdro).

LiDAR point cloud simplification is a key phase in addressing this issue, which effectively promotes the development of LiDAR technology in many engineering fields. In this study, an innovative point cloud simplification algorithm with the fuzzy encoding-decoding mechanism is proposed. In the developed scheme, an approach for curvature estimation is first designed on the basis of the k-neighbor searching and principal component analysis. Then, a collection of feature point sets is set up with the ordered curvatures. Subsequently, a Fuzzy C-Means clustering based encoding mechanism is employed to capture the level point cloud structures in depth and establish a reasonable and streamlined strategy for point clouds. Each feature point set and non-feature point set are encoded into a prototype matrix and a partition (membership) matrix. The membership degree of each feature point to its prototype becomes the basis for the simplification strategy. Finally, the simplification result of the point cloud is formed through merging the simplification results of all subsets. The method proposed in this study effectively preserves the point cloud features and ensures a uniform distribution of the simplified point cloud. A comparative analysis of the point cloud simplification is conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed algorithm outperformed other point cloud simplification algorithms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"162","pagesFromTo":"1-9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6784cc99fdbe833b3179cfa2","6784cc99fdbe833b3179cfa3","5e70922b878c28a047391011","6784cc99fdbe833b3179cfa4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477150","mniswId":"1519","title":"Applied Soft Computing Journal","issn":"1568-4946","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"890e228a-57d2-4fd2-951d-0b511604feff"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6784ccf2fdbe833b3179d582","year":"2024","volume":"162","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"1a397bac-33ff-4f65-9d2d-73bcc7bd1d3f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Point cloud simplification","Fuzzy encoding-decoding mechanism","Prototypes","Partition matrix","Feature extraction"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060462672"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678e4bf8fdbe8352f868e127","name":"Xingyu","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"c31df9eb-fa4d-4961-bd6e-ac0c737cad0f"},{"objectId":"678e4bf8fdbe8352f868e126","name":"Hao","lastName":"Sun","documentHash":"e12f9c2e-7bba-486e-9db5-0d28f6ab8dd7"},{"objectId":"678e4bf8fdbe8352f868e125","name":"Ke","lastName":"Qin","documentHash":"3ae37dc9-563b-41c5-a0b2-ede140368ec9"},{"objectId":"678e4bf8fdbe8352f868e124","name":"Ren","lastName":"Xu","documentHash":"79625ea1-682e-4358-afa3-3d5d8fe1d546"},{"objectId":"678e4bf8fdbe8352f868e123","name":"Guanglian","lastName":"Bai","documentHash":"af8e3c18-029c-424d-bfdc-2f6a4d49ada2"},{"objectId":"678e4bf8fdbe8352f868e122","name":"Jing","lastName":"Jin","documentHash":"dd00a2ff-dd7e-48e7-8b04-9a22298b8a11"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e6d","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Cichocki","uuid":"A492EA7996E0A2D8AA1438AFDB549E6A5A1627A6E51EF9CB549D43021827C0CE3BEF148F04062455C1FEEF399F0B443F37BE01513DD8B4FBA42D8808390D6CC8","documentHash":"532d2c49-9c8b-47a0-9afc-e7fc7d95fd74"}],"objectId":"678e4bf8fdbe8352f868e120","doi":"10.1088/1741-2552/ad593b","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/ad593b","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A cross-dataset adaptive domain selection transfer learning framework for motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective. In brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that utilize motor imagery (MI), minimizing calibration time has become increasingly critical for real-world applications. Recently, transfer learning (TL) has been shown to effectively reduce the calibration time in MI-BCIs. However, variations in data distribution among subjects can significantly influence the performance of TL in MI-BCIs. Approach. We propose a cross-dataset adaptive domain selection transfer learning framework that integrates domain selection, data alignment, and an enhanced common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm. Our approach uses a huge dataset of 109 subjects as the source domain. We begin by identifying non-BCI illiterate subjects from this huge dataset, then determine the source domain subjects most closely aligned with the target subjects using maximum mean discrepancy. After undergoing Euclidean alignment processing, features are extracted by multiple composite CSP. The final classification is carried out using the support vector machine. Main results. Our findings indicate that the proposed technique outperforms existing methods, achieving classification accuracies of 75.05% and 76.82% in two cross-dataset experiments, respectively. Significance.

While researchers worldwide have proposed a wide variety of EAs, certain limitations remain, such as slow convergence speed and poor generalization capabilities. Consequently, numerous scholars actively explore improvements to algorithmic structures, operators, search patterns, etc., to enhance their optimization performance. Reinforcement learning (RL) integrated as a component in the EA framework has demonstrated superior performance in recent years. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on integrating reinforcement learning into the evolutionary algorithm, referred to as reinforcement learning-assisted evolutionary algorithm (RL-EA). We begin with the conceptual outlines of reinforcement learning and the evolutionary algorithm. We then provide a taxonomy of RL-EA. Subsequently, we discuss the RL-EA integration method, the RL-assisted strategy adopted by RL-EA, and its applications according to the existing literature. The RL-assisted procedure is divided according to the implemented functions including solution generation, learnable objective function, algorithm/operator/sub-population selection, parameter adaptation, and other strategies. Additionally, different attribute settings of RL in RL-EA are discussed. In the applications of RL-EA section, we also demonstrate the excellent performance of RL-EA on several benchmarks and a range of public datasets to facilitate a quick comparative study. Finally, we analyze potential directions for future research. This survey serves as a rich resource for researchers interested in RL-EA as it overviews the current state-of-the-art and highlights the associated challenges. By leveraging this survey, readers can swiftly gain insights into RL-EA to develop efficient algorithms, thereby fostering further advancements in this emerging field."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"86","pagesFromTo":"1-22","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67850da2fdbe833b31833ff6","67850da2fdbe833b31833ff7","67850da2fdbe833b31833ff8","67850da2fdbe833b31833ff9","67850da2fdbe833b31833ffa","67850da2fdbe833b31833ffb","5e70922b878c28a047391011","67850da2fdbe833b31833ffc","67850da2fdbe833b31833ffd","67850da2fdbe833b31833ffe","67850da2fdbe833b31833fff"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798a4","mniswId":"19189","title":"Swarm and Evolutionary Computation","issn":"2210-6502","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"6b97eb84-87b8-49a2-b4c4-0959b027c2fe"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67850da2fdbe833b31833ff5","year":"2024","volume":"86","documentHash":"f627959a-5eb7-4756-badf-59b917c2f9b9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Evolutionary algorithm","Reinforcement learning","Optimization","Reinforcement learning-assisted strategy","Generating solution","Learnable objective function","Algorithm/operator/sub-population selection","Parameter adaptation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060466761"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047396047","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Łukasik","uuid":"DAF2AC696D29F8B19FD71F0D1557F07F18AA37EC4561B5F673FC0B4A390E7C0CA2A37E1A37B594F0EB3409355F232DC221E292FA918FB4DD2ACFE83A940135AC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6716-610X","documentHash":"2603c35e-9d04-4cf8-aba3-0b89a9c80c7d"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394b1d","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Szott","uuid":"9E5CF3616086F76B88C920845CD278EA08694BCEE67C15A1CBCF565837DCA5DFD8508033EBD1FE04F737A4C1B531D8DFCFD56172549614F2984C61C9B7553212","orcidId":"0000-0001-5884-5581","documentHash":"4013f5e0-e875-4bde-a7af-2b25102f4795"},{"objectId":"5e70922c878c28a047391184","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Leszczuk","uuid":"B6FCC9427CBAF8F0DA8322C71790B86B24C062792716624FE28A6D26A779A704579C4FDCA799D36DE41954258DB032D48200E7C49BAE6642B02803BEA77297F1","orcidId":"0000-0001-9123-1039","documentHash":"6a3d1999-3682-486f-8601-8bf8b5510eec"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67627d38fdbe837ab127d0e7","doi":"10.3390/s24186051","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/18/6051","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Multimodal image-based indoor localization with machine learning - a systematic review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Outdoor positioning has become a ubiquitous technology, leading to the proliferation of many location-based services such as automotive navigation and asset tracking.

It is widely recognized that regardless of the design method and rules employed by a fuzzy model, the determination of fuzzy sets remains a crucial aspect. FCNN and its improved variants utilize conventional fuzzy clustering algorithms to partition the feature space into fuzzy sets. However, this approach tends to disregard the distinctions inherent in data patterns. Although FCNN is a nonlinear model in relation to the input variables, it is a linear model with respect to the parameters that need to be estimated. Inspired by this, our method incorporates a pre-training phase where we utilize sample residuals from a linear regression algorithm to measure differences between data patterns. These differences are subsequently integrated into the fuzzy partition, yielding more refined fuzzy sets. To combat overfitting that can degrade the model’s predictive capability, we introduce a convolutional regularization strategy that integrates the convolution operator from harmonic analysis into the construction of regularization. Compared to conventional regularization, this convolutional regularization strategy is more effective in improving the regularity of the design matrix, thereby reducing the variation between coefficients and enhancing the model’s generalization ability. The efficacy of the presented method is substantiated by experimental studies conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"154","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67877168fdbe8374ef29113f","67877168fdbe8374ef291140","67877168fdbe8374ef291141","67877168fdbe8374ef291142","67877168fdbe8374ef291143","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477150","mniswId":"1519","title":"Applied Soft Computing Journal","issn":"1568-4946","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"890e228a-57d2-4fd2-951d-0b511604feff"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67877168fdbe8374ef29113e","year":"2024","volume":"154","documentHash":"4ea8f321-609f-4430-9d99-7fefce85a159"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Augmented FCNN","Pre-training with linear regression","Weighted fuzzy clustering","Convolutional regularization strategy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060494016"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67877820fdbe8374ef296f06","name":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","documentHash":"db2f58f8-0f6e-4a3d-aa81-3c995980025e"},{"objectId":"67877820fdbe8374ef296f05","name":"Ye","lastName":"Cui","documentHash":"c828187c-a516-4ff4-8b67-89f346781dc3"},{"objectId":"67877820fdbe8374ef296f04","name":"Qianli","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"31355e2f-2a67-4b3e-b15b-b88c2d072900"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"67877820fdbe8374ef296f02","doi":"10.1016/j.inffus.2023.102083","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2023.102083","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Conjunctive and disjunctive combination rules in random permutation set theory: A layer-2 belief structure perspective","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In uncertainty reasoning, conjunctive and disjunctive combination rules are the core tools for information updates. As an extension of evidential reasoning, random permutation set reasoning models uncertain information based on ordered focal sets. Existing combination rules in random permutation set theory, orthogonal sums, do not satisfy the commutativity of one of the original distributions and overly obey its order information. In this paper, the random permutation set theory is interpreted as an refined extension of Dempster–Shafer theory, and a layer-2 belief structure is proposed to describe the permutation event space. Compared with the traditional belief structure, the proposed structure can model both symbolic and numerical uncertainty. Based on the above, the conjunctive and disjunctive combination rules in Dempster–Shafer theory are extended to random permutation set theory. Through properties analysis and simulation demonstration, we demonstrate that the proposed methods can not only resolve the counter-intuitive results of orthogonal sums, but make full use of order information in distributions as well. In addition, we also extend the product space operations and discounting methods based on the proposed methods, and give a general framework of multi-source information fusion under the random permutation set theory."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"102","pagesFromTo":"1-18","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67877820fdbe8374ef296f04","67877820fdbe8374ef296f05","5e70922b878c28a047391011","67877820fdbe8374ef296f06"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d0","mniswId":"8320","title":"Information Fusion","issn":"1566-2535","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c64b5410-c718-42f9-9f6b-d517eb0fed3e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67877820fdbe8374ef296f03","year":"2024","volume":"102","documentHash":"e164272d-e294-41e0-95b9-d7799003b07b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Information fusion","Conjunctive and disjunctive rules","Random permutation set","Ordered focal set","Layer-2 belief structure"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060494065"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6788fb6afdbe837345638c28","name":"Mario","lastName":"Köppen","documentHash":"5f0862d8-117b-44e6-bcb1-213c97b49bb7"},{"objectId":"6788fb6afdbe837345638c27","name":"Luis","lastName":"Martinez","documentHash":"26946ceb-2cee-4174-9b0b-f6dfc14e657e"},{"objectId":"6788fb6afdbe837345638c26","name":"Ilgin","lastName":"Gokasar","documentHash":"7bd29ebd-0312-48d3-b9cd-6e59edb5a8fc"},{"objectId":"6788fb6afdbe837345638c25","name":"Dragan","lastName":"Pamucar","documentHash":"8c334bdb-7d33-4c87-8aa8-3d5f67d2e4c3"},{"objectId":"6788fb6afdbe837345638c24","name":"Muhammet","lastName":"Deveci","documentHash":"ed87dfdb-e5c9-4b67-9113-ef3c4eeab25c"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"6788fb6afdbe837345638c22","doi":"10.1016/j.engappai.2023.107242","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2023.107242","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Accelerating the integration of the metaverse into urban transportation using fuzzy trigonometric based decision making","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Metaverse is defined as a fictional universe that could serve as a simulation environment of reality.

In the first stage, fuzzy FUCOM methods are used to calculate the weights of the criteria. In the second stage, the fuzzy trigonometric based CoCoSo method is applied to evaluate and rank the alternatives. The proposed model enables the nonlinear processing of complex and uncertain information using fuzzy trigonometric functions. The findings demonstrate focusing on a particular age group can make it easier to integrate the metaverse with urban transportation.

Recently, transfer learning (TL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing calibration time in MI-BCI. However, the different data distribution of subjects greatly affects the application effect of TL in MI-BCI. Therefore, this paper combines data alignment, source domain selection, and feature alignment into the MI-TL. We propose a novel dual-step transfer framework based on source domain selection and feature alignment. First, the source and target domains are aligned using a pre-calibration strategy (PS), and then a sequential reverse selection method is proposed to match the optimal source domain for each target domain with the designed dual model selection strategy. We use filter bank regularization common space pattern (FBRCSP) to obtain more features and introduce manifold embedded distribution alignment (MEDA) to correct the prediction results of the support vector machine (SVM). The experimental results on two competition public datasets (BCI competition IV Dataset 1 and Dataset 2a) and our dataset show that the average classification accuracy of the proposed framework is higher than the baseline method (no domain selection and no feature alignment), which reaches 84.12%, 79.91%, and 78.45%, respectively.

Brain–computer interface (BCI) system has emerged as a promising technology that provides direct communication and control between the human brain and external devices. Among the various applications of BCI, limb motion decoding has gained significant attention due to its potential for patients with motor impairment to regain independence and improve their quality of life. However, the reconstruction of continuous motion trajectories in BCI systems based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a challenge in practical life. Approach. This study investigates the feasibility of applying feature selection and nonlinear regression for decoding motion trajectory from EEG. We propose to fix the time window, select the optimal feature set, and reconstruct the motion trajectory of motor execution tasks using polynomial regression. The proposed approach is validated on a public dataset consisting of EEG and hand position data recorded from 15 subjects. Several methods including ridge regression and multiple linear regression are employed as comparisons. Main results. The cross-validation results show that the proposed reconstructed method has the highest correlation with actual motion trajectories, with an average value of 0.511 ± 0.019 (p< 0.05). Significance.

The eOGS online learning algorithm reveals information granules in the flow and design the structure and parameters of a granular rule-based model with a certain degree of interpretability based on acoustic attributes obtained from phone calls made over 7 months to the Psychiatry department of a hospital. A multi-objective programming problem that trades-off information specificity, model compactness, and numerical and granular error indices is presented. Spectral and prosodic attributes are ranked and selected based on a hybrid Pearson-Spearman correlation coefficient. Low attribute-class correlation, ranging from 0.03 to 0.07, is observed, as well as high class overlap, which is typical in the psychiatric field. eOGS models for BD recognition overcome alternative computational-intelligence models, namely, Dynamic Evolving Neural-Fuzzy Inference System (DENFIS) and Fuzzy-set-Based evolving Modeling (FBeM-Gauss), by a small margin in both best and average cases; followed by eXtended Takagi-Sugeno (xTS) and evolving Takagi Sugeno (eTS) types of models. The proposed eOGS model using only 8 of the original acoustic attributes, and about 15 ‘If-Then’ inference rules, has exhibited the best root mean square error, 0.1361, and 91.8% accuracy in sharp BD class estimates.

The displacement and stress of this structure are governed by the system of coupled variational inequalities. The structural optimization problem consists in finding such material distribution of the domain occupied by the body in contact to minimize the contact stress. Using the regularization of the stress projection operator as well as of the friction this original structural optimization problem is replaced by the regularized ones. The phase field approach is used to approximate sharp interface formulation and to calculate the derivative of the cost functional. The Lagrange multiplier technique is used to find the set of necessary optimality conditions. Gradient flow approach in the form of modified Cahn-Hilliard boundary value problem is used to evaluate optimal topology domain. The evolution of the structure topology is governed by the cost functional derivative.

Opara, having the aim of shedding light on some data structuring problems, which can be ultimately framed in terms of cluster analysis, although not necessarily from the very start. The essence of reverse clustering is as follows: for some data set X, describing a definite set I of entities, and some given partition PA of the set I, find a clustering procedure, which, when applied to X, yields a partition PB, which is possibly similar to PA. Thus, trivially, if PA were obtained on the basis of X with the use of some of the classical clustering algorithms, then one should obtain PB identical to it, and the algorithm found should be the same as that used to obtain PA. Yet, there is a wide multiplicity of situations, in which (i) PA may have been obtained on the basis of data different from X, at least to an extent; and (ii) our trust in PA (or the knowledge regarding its origin and character) may vary quite significantly, from being absolutely sure to regarding PA as a sort of (initial) proposal to be discussed.

In this particular paper, we are concerned with the data on ad-related web traffic, in which we would like to tell the genuine human-generated traffic from the artificial bot-generated one. Yet, this dichotomy, even if of primary importance from the point of view of the respective “business model”, turns out to be far too simplistic when confronted with the results of the analysis. We show how in the study process the awareness appears of a multiplicity of behavior patterns in the traffic analyzed, contributing also to the achievement of improved results. It is shown how quite simple clustering tools may provide effective identification of such patterns and their characteristics. A cognitive value added is also constituted by the very categorization of the behavior patterns identified and their relative persistence. The lessons learned may be of use for various analyses of a similar nature, where apparently simpler divisions, assumed at the outset, can only be effectively analyzed when perceived in their fuller complexity. It is also possible, given the deeper justification of the results obtained, that the concrete categorizations identified are of a wider significance than just for the case considered."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6793564afdbe835f61f434b7","5e70922b878c28a047391010"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"11-24","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a047391010","6793564afdbe835f61f434b7"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6793554efdbe835f61f416c7","doi":"10.1007/978-981-99-6529-8","title":"Proceedings of 22nd International Conference on Informatics in Economy (IE 2023): Education, Research and Business Technologies","year":2024,"isbn":"9789819969593","issn":"2190-3018","url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-99-6529-8","translation":false,"documentHash":"d4b75b39-ce03-47da-8cab-1e33beb2b54d","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["web","advertising","humans","bots","classification","clustering"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060550504"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"670f6ba1fdbe8317edcd6c0e","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Białecki","documentHash":"724c4b33-ac79-44ac-89af-c7a6f336596d"},{"objectId":"670f6ba1fdbe8317edcd6c0d","name":"Josep","lastName":"Batle","documentHash":"7b8a2bf8-00af-45bb-9f09-ea31872bce61"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7cef","name":"Adam","lastName":"Bednorz","uuid":"6A396DB9945482AE040D2C122C90EB4AB9A6F54B1DBE0E85EA0E6B345A6EBD0AECB80835641E3BB5E92841058CE1F7C788B68142AECB1FB81E02F10339154098","orcidId":"0000-0001-6329-2328","documentHash":"696182bc-7ba8-4ea5-bf66-9912b421fd04"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7a1c","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Tworzydło","uuid":"9A88D7983E08E413C0A2C5CF464CD8486AF2A72D831492D80C92CF21EEECBCDDAAACBAA54163ACBA3F72A08DA631CA049D539C872C709871BDAB7994AA98E52E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3410-5460","documentHash":"87e94d91-d733-4344-bc44-2202203bb85d"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0ec6","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Rybotycki","uuid":"897C50FD08D1E1C7E1D847E52E6B17284720DE16A905746C4FC31F35D1B1A20C8A6687DCBB6B343C4180F783FE2135C4D836F4938A191BE1C5CD6963ACDB5441","orcidId":"0000-0003-2493-0459","documentHash":"409ac0d1-bcc9-40c6-ad2f-00edeeea1141"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"670f6ba1fdbe8317edcd6c0c","doi":"10.1140/epjqt/s40507-024-00273-7","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjqt/s40507-024-00273-7","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Quantum null-hypothesis device-independent Schmidt number witness","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We investigate the dimensionality of bipartite quantum systems by construction of a device-independent null witness test.

Employing ANFIS offers several advantages: it enhances clarity regarding the correspondence between output and input values and rules, improves system interpretability, and facilitates the representation of linguistic variables and rules, thereby encouraging domain experts' involvement in enhancing the system's performance as needed. This paper illustrates the utility of ANFIS in adjusting the detected particulate matter (PM) concentration and compares its effectiveness with other established machine-learning techniques, including linear regression, decision trees, random forest, SVR and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). These methods are chosen as benchmarks owing to their established effectiveness in calibration procedures.\nWe propose certain preprocessing steps for detecting and rectifying anomalies, alongside introducing two distinct data-splitting methodologies. Additionally, a discussion about feature selection is presented to elucidate the impact of specific features on performance enhancement. The efficacy of ANFIS in refining PM data is demonstrated through a comparative assessment, where it outperforms all the established machine-learning techniques. Notably, incorporating only PM2.5, relative humidity and temperature as features yields optimal performance while mitigating overfitting issues. The paper also explores various ANFIS configurations, including two distinct optimization algorithms, and investigates the impact of the number and type of membership functions on the fuzzy system's performance. Our study highlights the potential of the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System as a versatile and effective tool for addressing real-world challenges in environmental sensing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927a878c28a04739672b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"83","pagesFromTo":"1-15","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c1b502fdbe831c673349d2","5e70927a878c28a04739672b","67c1b502fdbe831c673349d3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779f7","mniswId":"5323","title":"Ecological Informatics","issn":"1574-9541","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"d772af46-45fa-4217-8978-8bbac9a0b4ba"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c1b502fdbe831c673349d1","year":"2024","volume":"83","documentHash":"05b96306-abb0-4114-8c01-46d9996a9fce"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Air quality","Particlate matter","Adjustment","ANFIS model","Fuzzy logic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060592484"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6662fdbe831a3837874d","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Kubiak","documentHash":"2f23bac5-6866-44d5-91f1-bf79054305b2"},{"objectId":"677e6662fdbe831a3837874c","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Karolak","documentHash":"a4006748-47b0-4485-a480-37e2786da523"},{"objectId":"677e6662fdbe831a3837874b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pałkowski","documentHash":"db09036c-9124-4061-82e5-9bc8683d1e99"},{"objectId":"5e7092fb878c28a0473a06de","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Błaszczyński","uuid":"5480B0649A7BADA800DE657A83336F958DA93DDDE7120174E7831A2EF96FAAD6ED1EFE6DA3E97E595167165CE43846261BB94969DDF7912E5CB4F35B409E1316","documentHash":"98a38407-4497-4f48-ac43-527f54163b7c"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396da0","name":"Roman","lastName":"Słowiński","uuid":"AB1926BA4A9DED93AC177661DD774526EC689F9DEA2576B69B9B01761B4609D2F2C87038A8C688867E5CD6EEB89BA0B69AD7A7B241DEE418C47FC2A66DD1E1ED","orcidId":"0000-0002-5200-7795","documentHash":"cc5ad471-bd5b-46b0-bade-7f464a803b0c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2024-06-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"669111eefdbe83399d799305","doi":"10.32383/appdr/187795","publicUri":"https://www.ptfarm.pl/download/?file=File%2FActa_Poloniae%2F2024%2F2%2F331.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Application of Dominance-Based Rough Set Approach in Vaginal Dosage Form Optimization","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The objective of this study was to identify the cause-effect relationships between various data related to vaginal dosage forms, such as composition, process parameters (condition attributes), and quality (decision attribute), by employing a mathematical data mining approach that utilizes rough set theory. The analyzed data were organized in a tabular format known as an information system. Objects were labeled as rows, and attributes as columns, with attribute-values serving as entries. Each formulation was described by its condition attributes (composition, manufacturing process, quality parameters), while the decision attribute indicated the quality of the formulation (expressed as pH after vaginal tablet or pessary application) and enabled classification as correct/incorrect or good/bad. The decision rules generated by the study provide insights into the relationships between the condition attributes and the decision attribute.\nThey highlight the importance of LA content and LA:polymer ratios in maintaining physiological pH. Additionally, the findings confirm the favorable impact of chitosan on pH regulation while indicating that the type of formulation (pessaries or tablets) does not significantly affect the classification of objects. Decision rules with high confirmation coefficients of condition attributes can help in developing optimal formulations. These decision rules contain essential information that describes the cause-and-effect relationships and are free of redundant information. They form the basis for understanding and optimizing processes and establishing a design space."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396da0","5e7092fb878c28a0473a06de"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396da0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"81","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"331 - 343","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677e6662fdbe831a3837874b","677e6662fdbe831a3837874c","677e6662fdbe831a3837874d","5e7092fb878c28a0473a06de","5e709281878c28a047396da0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e4d","mniswId":"308","title":"Acta Poloniae Pharmaceutica","issn":"0001-6837","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"7e220a91-f7d0-474b-a8f8-9ea83f5c966b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677e6662fdbe831a3837874a","year":"2024","volume":"81","number":"2","documentHash":"9c9ba591-4324-437a-b8fc-e14b89beb1f7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["vaginal route of administration","dosage forms","rough set theory","data mining","machine learning","vaginal tablet"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060613647"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"670eb73cfdbe8318b3766e35","name":"Josep","lastName":"Batle","documentHash":"7cff8348-8d17-4205-910f-5605b44422cf"},{"objectId":"670eb73cfdbe8318b3766e34","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Białecki","documentHash":"dec5a072-5da5-4414-a674-55618017dd4c"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7cef","name":"Adam","lastName":"Bednorz","uuid":"6A396DB9945482AE040D2C122C90EB4AB9A6F54B1DBE0E85EA0E6B345A6EBD0AECB80835641E3BB5E92841058CE1F7C788B68142AECB1FB81E02F10339154098","orcidId":"0000-0001-6329-2328","documentHash":"696182bc-7ba8-4ea5-bf66-9912b421fd04"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0ec6","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Rybotycki","uuid":"897C50FD08D1E1C7E1D847E52E6B17284720DE16A905746C4FC31F35D1B1A20C8A6687DCBB6B343C4180F783FE2135C4D836F4938A191BE1C5CD6963ACDB5441","orcidId":"0000-0003-2493-0459","documentHash":"409ac0d1-bcc9-40c6-ad2f-00edeeea1141"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"670eb73cfdbe8318b3766e31","doi":"10.1002/qute.202400264","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qute.202400264","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Device‐Independent Dimension Leakage Null Test on Qubits at Low Operational Cost","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A null test of the two-level space of a qubit is constructed, which is both device independent and needs a small number of different experiments.

polyangiitis (EGPA) recruited at the pneumonological centre and mainly antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody negativity.\nMethods\n\nWe retrospectively recruited 86 patients. Relapse was defined as the recurrence or appearance of new organ symptoms. The study end-point included the final examination.\nResults\n\nRelapses occurred in 34.9% of the patients, while 9.3% died. Immunosuppressive therapy (P = 0.042), prolonged low-dose corticosteroid treatments (mainly for asthma) (P = 0.006), and longer follow-up duration (P = 0.004) were associated with a higher relapse risk, while advanced EGPA severity (P = 0.0015) and activity (P = 0.044), older age of onset (P = 0.030), symptomatic cardiac involvement (P = 0.007), and postinflammatory cardiac fibrosis (P = 0.038) were associated with a higher risk of death. Sinusitis (P = 0.028) and prolonged low-dose corticosteroid treatments (P = 0.025) correlated with a better prognosis. Relapses did not have an impact on the mortality (P = 0.693).\nConclusions\n\nRelapses in EGPA remain frequent, although they do not impact mortality. Cardiac involvement is common, but clinically symptomatic cardiomyopathy is associated with a higher risk of death. Asthma requiring chronic corticosteroid treatments is associated with a lower risk of death, although the risk of EGPA recurrence is significantly higher."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deda","uid":"btz9n5ZEfjQ8kaVG7tKm2Hw","uuid":"e711ee8e-d6f5-4f65-bd9b-29d4fe201466","name":"Instytut Gruźlicy i Chorób Płuc","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bdef6","5e709479878c28a0473bdf07","5e709405878c28a0473b5065"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deda","parentUuid":"e711ee8e-d6f5-4f65-bd9b-29d4fe201466","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deda","rootUuid":"e711ee8e-d6f5-4f65-bd9b-29d4fe201466","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942c878c28a0473b7889"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"34","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"157–166","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bdf07","5e709479878c28a0473bdef6","5e70942c878c28a0473b7889","5e70933f878c28a0473a5966","5e709405878c28a0473b5065"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478ece","mniswId":"14505","title":"Modern Rheumatology","issn":"1439-7595","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"91c53d28-a607-448d-8ca3-555ed56f3e97"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659d92c240970776647a2287","year":"2024","volume":"34","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"1d6b4f6a-4769-4bc7-b859-adc69aa9510f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis","prognosis","relapse","systemic vasculitis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060652938"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6399bd3f40970768cd0fdf74","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Nowak","documentHash":"fd9c7bc7-f294-4004-b4d9-61e96d647d10"},{"objectId":"5e70942b878c28a0473b7874","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Siudem","uuid":"C093B29D3F7B3DB9406A537C070D78302F61A801D3B440781AD6D501A102C014920971CB75E75026122BA2BE834B10EB7BEFEC3AB1A08F6EF0F863C6F9B24E5C","orcidId":"0000-0002-9391-6477","documentHash":"fb2bb58f-4769-4383-b5a0-7879dc47aeee"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395fcb","name":"Marek","lastName":"Gągolewski","uuid":"D1F789DA719ACDE4F786BBA60CF8D2DE726661D5A7E254F316F4820329A49BCFEEA3CF3ED30E610FD1925A22E44E517CE8570971F86F2FC086AC8F5C20BEE1C0","orcidId":"0000-0003-0637-6028","documentHash":"0308d267-3047-4e3d-a992-4311b211b0b2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-11-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"6399bd3f40970768cd0fdf72","doi":"10.1016/j.physa.2022.128059","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2022.128059","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Power laws, the Price model, and the Pareto type-2 distribution","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We consider a version of D. Price’s model for the growth of a bibliographic network, where in each iteration, a constant number of citations is randomly allocated according to a weighted combination of the accidental (uniformly distributed) and the preferential (rich-get-richer) rule. Instead of relying on the typical master equation approach, we formulate and solve this problem in terms of the rank–size distribution. We show that, asymptotically, such a process leads to a Pareto-type 2 distribution with a new, appealingly interpretable parametrisation. We prove that the solution to the Price model expressed in terms of the rank–size distribution coincides with the expected values of order statistics in an independent Paretian sample. An empirical analysis of a large repository of academic papers yields a good fit not only in the tail of the distribution (as it is usually the case in the power law-like framework), but also across a significantly larger fraction of the data domain."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709274878c28a047395fcb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"606","pagesFromTo":"128059","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942b878c28a0473b7874","6399bd3f40970768cd0fdf74","5e709274878c28a047395fcb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479251","mniswId":"16061","title":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","issn":"0378-4371","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"430cd6d1-4545-4cfa-afa4-10f993238f3e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6399bd3f40970768cd0fdf73","year":"2022","volume":"606","documentHash":"29da95fa-4023-4151-894e-45bcd9dd5262"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Price model","Pareto distribution","Power laws","Rich get richer","Complex networks","Citations"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060693734"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c57542fdbe8365657d4ae5","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Niewczas","documentHash":"1a2e350f-a937-4214-8c2c-3e3ea5a6ec3b"},{"objectId":"67c57542fdbe8365657d4ae4","name":"Ernest","lastName":"Jeczmionek","documentHash":"fdd8b4c3-58d9-4143-b2f7-b3f0e041b0c8"},{"objectId":"5e70927b878c28a0473967fc","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kulczycki","uuid":"3EC736DD0FE5871871EB4AEBC86B589E2CEBDBEEB8FF9533D3BF6D35B8BB8EBBFD6DABA87FE38E17C6990066353F5297738CECD38A86ABF8864E4233DFA1D27C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8641-8886","documentHash":"9ad8b42e-92d1-43ee-8734-01a4765b9e5e"},{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a04739672b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"C1E0886648E29CCCCF7F1EE9A427AE3AEA819060637B746A0A63E8FF5EAC712E893EA032ABFA3B046CA6A236FE5825804A223C3E67F2479FA32DB7F08AFD315A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4041-6900","documentHash":"df94745e-321f-447c-bdeb-b95e563aee03"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047396047","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Łukasik","uuid":"DAF2AC696D29F8B19FD71F0D1557F07F18AA37EC4561B5F673FC0B4A390E7C0CA2A37E1A37B594F0EB3409355F232DC221E292FA918FB4DD2ACFE83A940135AC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6716-610X","documentHash":"2603c35e-9d04-4cf8-aba3-0b89a9c80c7d"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047396044","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Charytanowicz","uuid":"21B4690A4BBE001432456F66E7090F86CB9A837C1A26B40EAA0C92795E0BA562456C2700DB0D9818B093E02CA2212B006F27193FB57CEB42EABF419028D2AD15","orcidId":"0000-0002-1956-3941","documentHash":"a50ee15d-4d4a-422e-b630-ac83ca9abfde"}],"objectId":"67c57542fdbe8365657d4ae3","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-72393-3_1","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-72393-3_1","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2025,"title":"Classification of Wheat Species Using Convolutional Neural Networks: A Comparative Study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper introduces a novel image dataset tailored for evaluating machine learning solutions, particularly focusing on deep neural networks.

However, contrary to clustering and classification, an atypical element detection task does not possess any natural quality (performance) index. The subject of the research presented here is the creation of one. It will enable not only evaluation of the results of a procedure for atypical element detection, but also optimization of its parameters or other quantities. The investigated quality index works particularly well with frequency types of such procedures, especially in the presence of substantial noise. Using a nonparametric approach in the design of this index practically frees the proposed method from the distribution in the dataset under examination. It may also be successfully applied to multimodal and multidimensional cases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927b878c28a0473967fc","60c33f3b9543c72336544258","5e709274878c28a047396044"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"34","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"439-451","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927b878c28a0473967fc","60c33f3b9543c72336544258","5e709274878c28a047396044"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478175","mniswId":"8624","title":"International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science","issn":"1641-876X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"dfc095e3-860a-4798-924f-bd64ed62bed8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f40436fdbe832737280f01","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"34","number":"3","documentHash":"36e79ed7-7f9a-4777-8af9-e6fcbb9b817d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["atypical elements","data analysis","outliers","quality (performance) index","rare elements"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060753819"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c81396fdbe83551ebf4d68","name":"Carlos E.","lastName":"Palau","documentHash":"800dfd55-965e-44b0-bd53-fd68bcf266f6"},{"objectId":"67c81396fdbe83551ebf4d67","name":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Tzovaras","documentHash":"ecfc5d16-09dd-4f67-9caf-bd0f180f57d1"},{"objectId":"67c81396fdbe83551ebf4d66","name":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Votis","documentHash":"54776d38-1ebc-4285-85b3-e6e55dba2e75"},{"objectId":"67c81396fdbe83551ebf4d65","name":"Anastasia Kassiani","lastName":"Blitsi","documentHash":"e60fca2b-6c75-4354-8cb0-798d548a80e8"},{"objectId":"67c81396fdbe83551ebf4d64","name":"Anastasia","lastName":"Theodouli","documentHash":"e6a98da7-c9f4-45b8-afe6-0ea242f4107f"},{"objectId":"67c81396fdbe83551ebf4d63","name":"Charalambos","lastName":"Tassakos","documentHash":"1e160f59-a7db-4793-a78d-7132fc943937"},{"objectId":"67c81396fdbe83551ebf4d62","name":"Anastasiya","lastName":"Danilenka","documentHash":"906f2f83-39f2-4446-a38a-9767f04ddef0"},{"objectId":"67c81396fdbe83551ebf4d61","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Bogacka","documentHash":"ebb5efbb-e1b6-4126-8b23-e7259c8eb3e2"},{"objectId":"67c81396fdbe83551ebf4d60","name":"Ignacio","lastName":"Lacalle","documentHash":"8a26bf0b-64e1-4fe0-94b2-bb055678cb3b"},{"objectId":"67c81396fdbe83551ebf4d5f","name":"Eduardo","lastName":"Garro","documentHash":"8fe1a59d-c4f0-4f29-8631-d116d009ffb6"},{"objectId":"5e709460878c28a0473bbbb2","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wasielewska-Michniewska","uuid":"7AC38E766400919F5105968D58CBEACEC4CA05765138568D6854E0AC9D6E612DBC361D82892AC468833F6AAC7F34A0FA87AFF8EBFC6DC459D2C51E5CE37E9333","documentHash":"650618eb-edb9-4d99-bd37-453b9670bf3f"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394e98","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Paprzycki","uuid":"5B7C90E72D40497375F5BA78D1C4DB9BB79A6D4D7BB177AD034994CA885AAF6ED7617D5EF01EEBCCF0178890D10A52D5AC35FE1F7603165AE8C861AE672BCCD5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8069-2152","documentHash":"3f20fd48-b1cd-4c97-952f-84211d07be00"}],"objectId":"67c81396fdbe83551ebf4d5e","doi":"10.1201/9781032632407-14","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1201/9781032632407-14","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Decentralized Strategy for Artificial Intelligence in Distributed IoT Ecosystems: Federation in ASSIST-IoT","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Decentralization of the IoT ecosystems poses several challenges whenever AI is applied in a shared fashion.

This trend can be related to the large number of potential application areas. Moreover, increasing computational capabilities of modern computers allowed turning theory of graph algorithms into explorations of best methods for their actual realization. These factors, in turn, brought about ideas like creation of a hardware component dedicated to graph computation; i.e., the Graphcore Intelligent Processor Unit (IPU). Interestingly, Graphcore systems are a hardware implementation of the Bulk Synchronous Parallel paradigm, which seemed to be a mostly theoretical concept from the end of last century. In this context, the question that has to be addressed experimentally is as follows: how good are Graphcore systems in comparison with standard systems that can be used to run graph algorithms, i.e., CPUs and GPUs. To provide a partial response to this broad question, in this contribution, PageRank, Single Source Shortest Path and Breadth-First Search algorithms are used to compare the performance of IPU-deployed algorithms to other parallel architectures. Obtained results clearly show that the Graphcore IPU outperforms other devices for the studied heterogeneous algorithms and, currently, provides best-in-class execution time results for a range of graph sizes and densities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709264878c28a047394e98","5e709241878c28a04739297b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-15","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094cd878c28a0473c4099","6174c5287523400564d2b043","5e709264878c28a047394e98","5e709241878c28a04739297b","62b67329752340195a38cb74","5e709200878c28a04738e734"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bfef","mniswId":"5581","title":"Electronics (Switzerland)","eissn":"2079-9292","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"d24835fa-79e8-41ed-9235-04b77a1dc9bd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"665f0f624097074fa1b26134","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"13","number":"11","documentHash":"7c182fde-8ddf-401c-ae72-31e1c29b9011"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["intelligent processor unit","parallel graph algorithms","performance evaluation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060804946"},{"authors":[],"objectId":"659be3304097076e5900fe17","doi":"10.1007/978-981-19-8094-7","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-19-8094-7","type":"EDITED_BOOK","typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","year":2023,"title":"International Symposium on Intelligent Informatics: Proceedings of ISI 2022","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This book constitutes thoroughly refereed post-conference proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Intelligent Informatics (ISI 2022), from August 31 to September 1–2, 2022, Trivandrum, India.

As an application, we consider the class of QCQP problems with a special form of the quadratic terms of the constraints."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ffeb1e8085dcb0e357dcc91","5e709273878c28a047395e33"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-20","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709273878c28a047395e33","5ffeb1e8085dcb0e357dcc91"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479119","mniswId":"15497","title":"Optimization","issn":"0233-1934","eissn":"1029-4945","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f855f1ac-f92d-4ac0-adc6-5f87b7f07fc7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a8ec3b40970706a44f8c3a","year":"2023","documentHash":"499d3851-d07c-43c5-bfa6-9ddb042cae85"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Global solvability","QCQP problems","KKT conditions","S-lemma","generalized image set"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060810443"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66853d2cfdbe83043b5e6bad","name":"Jinyang","lastName":"Zhao","documentHash":"3e1f4dd2-622a-4ebf-8fa7-fc0aa1f5ddb1"},{"objectId":"66853d2cfdbe83043b5e6bac","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Shekhovtsov","documentHash":"00243671-cd7d-4ce6-9189-898e80051552"},{"objectId":"66853d2cfdbe83043b5e6bab","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Granat","documentHash":"c87cabe9-ad96-4ec4-9a25-be7dcad05aba"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0946","name":"Marek","lastName":"Makowski","uuid":"6124BA71FD42D934638D3F4F7E43E06A3398CF92609518BA61E13F66AE11E14560CCB1D905E9B1D012BF8087F12100D351B69EDE50936109281940E9C457403D","documentHash":"cb49a74b-5f3c-49d7-abb4-ea1cbae7895c"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739100e","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Nahorski","uuid":"1EF2B08D468D1EF6CA5ABE8126DCD17798EB839E7274A8A4BC24B463FB0BE117628EDF6056801D65239486B31E9BDA80234841E215F38754E9F3EB67B689D6C0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2340-8020","documentHash":"9de9252a-2092-4211-92b7-73f2c543d376"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"66853d2cfdbe83043b5e6ba9","doi":"10.1016/j.softx.2024.101801","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2024.101801","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"pyMCMA: Uniformly distributed Pareto-front representation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"pyMCMA is the Python implementation of a novel method for autonomous computation of the Pareto-front representation composed of efficient solutions distributed uniformly in terms of distances between neighbor Pareto solutions. pyMCMA supports scientific, i.e. objective, model analysis by providing preference-free Pareto front representation. pyMCMA seamlessly integrates independently developed substantive models.

the Cloud–Edge–IoT continuum is challenging due to the wide variety of available hardware platforms, stringent performance requirements, and the heterogeneity of the workloads themselves. To alleviate this, a novel, flexible approach for machine learning inference is introduced, which is suitable for deployment in diverse environments—including edge devices. The proposed solution has a modular design and is compatible with a wide range of user-defined machine learning pipelines. To improve energy efficiency and scalability, a high-performance communication protocol for inference is propounded, along with a scale-out mechanism based on a load balancer. The inference service plugs into the ASSIST-IoT reference architecture, thus taking advantage of its other components. The solution was evaluated in two scenarios closely emulating real-life use cases, with demanding workloads and requirements constituting several different deployment scenarios. The results from the evaluation show that the proposed software meets the high throughput and low latency of inference requirements of the use cases while effectively adapting to the available hardware. The code and documentation, in addition to the data used in the evaluation, were open-sourced to foster adoption of the solution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6157c42975234017e04d67a2","633f8f297523402e340fee5f","634f612b752340623bbe664e","5e709241878c28a04739297b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6157c42975234017e04d67a2","5e709264878c28a047394e98","633f8f297523402e340fee5f","5e709460878c28a0473bbbb2","634f612b752340623bbe664e","5e709241878c28a04739297b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-31","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["633f8f297523402e340fee5f","6157c42975234017e04d67a2","5e709241878c28a04739297b","634f612b752340623bbe664e","67e51a1afdbe831b59a2cffd","5e709460878c28a0473bbbb2","5e709264878c28a047394e98","67e51a1afdbe831b59a2d000"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bfef","mniswId":"5581","title":"Electronics (Switzerland)","eissn":"2079-9292","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"d24835fa-79e8-41ed-9235-04b77a1dc9bd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"663b223a4097076263a63d6f","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"13","number":"10","documentHash":"895572a4-25a9-4a09-9fd9-f86c9fc84595"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["machine learning","edge computing","IoT","loud–edge–IoT","inference","gRPC","inference server"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060842367"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67e51a6afdbe831b59a2d38b","name":"Costin","lastName":"Bădică","documentHash":"22e2698e-84d6-4d91-878e-55ab6e6a9afe"},{"objectId":"67e51a6afdbe831b59a2d38a","name":"Giacomo","lastName":"Cabri","documentHash":"481cd42f-a5f9-4f70-a53b-8c2a77320602"},{"objectId":"67e51a6afdbe831b59a2d389","name":"Angelo","lastName":"Ferrando","documentHash":"dc7755c4-8532-481c-b8d9-047a8c0652a0"},{"objectId":"6711c828ece3983997134bf6","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Wrona","uuid":"68E3C4946E1B6B2047EFE5E46231970D85FD7F77ECFA87DBFCB2D1CD65679ADFB2DE8DAB69821890FB16923939E20B5EDF2A2F9611FE9097858A1310B40086CE","documentHash":"dfb4a729-1f85-4344-90b5-674855004a1d"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394e98","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Paprzycki","uuid":"5B7C90E72D40497375F5BA78D1C4DB9BB79A6D4D7BB177AD034994CA885AAF6ED7617D5EF01EEBCCF0178890D10A52D5AC35FE1F7603165AE8C861AE672BCCD5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8069-2152","documentHash":"3f20fd48-b1cd-4c97-952f-84211d07be00"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393837","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"69B55488B8D1553160F6968DE67997FE61BB33A168CC12502B4DE149C9AC62603EA5627E89EB806E8C8519165AAB47645A56D31118CB4FDD82C7291C06C09B38","orcidId":"0000-0002-5105-8873","documentHash":"f59957d4-aa45-44d8-af75-aa7faae78bc9"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a04739297b","name":"Maria","lastName":"Ganzha","uuid":"FE26E0DC9CD7FD1F79C4A997D7DC8891B9C0EE91BFE7ED751B9AB870736888AA93D8E9937A2CD6224547116A9D8C7FEB856D1DF950682C0D3DEC77E6B271B193","orcidId":"0000-0001-7714-4844","documentHash":"e6181dd5-2e2f-4441-b7d3-6ba79a91c547"}],"objectId":"67e51a6afdbe831b59a2d386","doi":"10.3390/app142210124","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/22/10124","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Comparison of Multi-Agent Platform Usability for Industrial-Grade Applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Nowoczesne systemy często wykorzystują zdecentralizowane i rozproszone podejścia. Można to przypisać między innymi rosnącej złożoności procesów systemowych, które wykraczają poza możliwości pojedynczych komponentów. Ponadto, wraz ze wzrostem zapotrzebowania na automatyzację systemów i koordynację na wysokim szczeblu, często stosuje się rozwiązania należące do zdecentralizowanej sztucznej inteligencji i wspólnego podejmowania decyzji. Można zauważyć, że te obawy mieszczą się w domenie systemów wieloagentowych. Jednak mimo że koncepcje MAS pojawiły się ponad 40 lat temu, pomimo ich oczywistych zalet i ciągłych wysiłków społeczności naukowej, agenci są nadal rzadko wykorzystywani w aplikacjach klasy przemysłowej. W tym kontekście celem tego wkładu jest analiza przyczyn braku przyjęcia rozwiązań agentowych w świecie rzeczywistym. Podczas analizy badane są wszystkie istotne aspekty cyklu życia nowoczesnego rozwoju oprogramowania i porównywane z tym, co jest obecnie dostępne w domenie systemów agentowych. W szczególności badanie koncentruje się na identyfikacji luk, które są często pomijane w przypadku naukowych zastosowań MAS, ale mają kluczowe znaczenie pod względem potencjału rozwoju systemów na dużą skalę w praktyce.\n\t\t\t\t"},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Modern systems often employ decentralised and distributed approaches. This can be attributed, among others, to the increasing complexity of system processes, which go beyond the capabilities of singular components. Additionally, with the growth in demand for system automation and high-level coordination, solutions belonging to the decentralised Artificial Intelligence and collaborative decision-making are often applied. It can be observed that these concerns fall within the domain of multi-agent systems. However, even though MAS concepts emerged more than 40 years ago, despite their obvious advantages and continuous efforts of the scientific community, agents remain rarely used in industrial-grade applications. In this context, the goal of this contribution is to analyse the reasons for the lack of adoption of agent solutions in the real world. During the analysis, all pertinent aspects of the modern software development life cycle are examined and compared to what is currently available in the agent system domain. Specifically, the study focuses on identifying gaps that are often overlooked when it comes to scientific applications of MAS, but are critical in terms of potential for large-scale system development in practice.\n\t\t\t\t"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6711c828ece3983997134bf6","5e709241878c28a04739297b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709264878c28a047394e98"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"1—28","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6711c828ece3983997134bf6","5e709241878c28a04739297b","5e709264878c28a047394e98","5e70924f878c28a047393837","67e51a6afdbe831b59a2d389","67e51a6afdbe831b59a2d38a","67e51a6afdbe831b59a2d38b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","eissn":"2076-3417","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"672b77ecfdbe8307b0580cdd","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"14","number":"22","documentHash":"f91f5a0b-e432-4f3f-8678-6dd8ec4ff201"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["systemy agentowe","zorientowane na agentów","inżynieria oprogramowania","SDLC","systemy klasy przemysłowej"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["industrial-grade systems","agent oriented","agent systems","software engineering","SDLC"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060884165"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6157c42975234017e04d67a2","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Sowiński","uuid":"61C2F74F415A6987BE0DF0CCF5E79A89E70D740035FB8CFE4DCED32E19D9D03DAF253E41CB974DDF55DD3DEE6E4E934D922DE5FBD48FD18086ADDEE4D5F68684","documentHash":"f1e63e58-a734-4db8-be82-7426cb11ec82"},{"objectId":"5e709461878c28a0473bbde2","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Szmeja","uuid":"7CCB16B6E7E3B7851245DCD0C8DE2B86D2C529EFDB5B046FDD7D0854477A5B2F76DCE28990A01F0D1D36D257FA492BAAC4D5A2FF30A98547B07B90E40D448B42","orcidId":"0000-0003-0869-3836","documentHash":"aa3d82e8-bd2e-4f7b-b3c8-d7851a0d8c0e"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394e98","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Paprzycki","uuid":"5B7C90E72D40497375F5BA78D1C4DB9BB79A6D4D7BB177AD034994CA885AAF6ED7617D5EF01EEBCCF0178890D10A52D5AC35FE1F7603165AE8C861AE672BCCD5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8069-2152","documentHash":"3f20fd48-b1cd-4c97-952f-84211d07be00"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a04739297b","name":"Maria","lastName":"Ganzha","uuid":"FE26E0DC9CD7FD1F79C4A997D7DC8891B9C0EE91BFE7ED751B9AB870736888AA93D8E9937A2CD6224547116A9D8C7FEB856D1DF950682C0D3DEC77E6B271B193","orcidId":"0000-0001-7714-4844","documentHash":"e6181dd5-2e2f-4441-b7d3-6ba79a91c547"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67e51a5efdbe831b59a2d2ff","doi":"10.3390/electronics13132558","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/13/2558","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"RDF Stream Taxonomy: Systematizing RDF Stream Types in Research and Practice","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Over the years, RDF streaming has been explored in research and practice from many angles, resulting in a wide range of RDF stream definitions. This variety presents a major challenge in discussing and integrating streaming systems due to a lack of a common language. This work attempts to address this critical research gap by systematizing RDF stream types present in the literature in a novel taxonomy. The proposed RDF Stream Taxonomy (RDF-STaX) is embodied in an OWL 2 DL ontology that follows the FAIR principles, making it readily applicable in practice. Extensive documentation and additional resources are provided to foster the adoption of the ontology. Three use cases for the ontology are presented with accompanying competency questions, demonstrating the usefulness of the resource. Additionally, this work introduces a novel nanopublications dataset, which serves as a collaborative, living state-of-the-art review of RDF streaming. The results of a multifaceted evaluation of the resource are presented, testing its logical validity, use case coverage, and adherence to the community’s best practices, while also comparing it to other works.

The cost functional is given by the energy dissipation in the fluid. The topological perturbation is carried out by the nucleation of an infinitesimal circular obstacle, which can be considered as a small measurement device. Our approach is based on the topological derivative method, which has been previously employed in the shape and topology optimization problems. The topological derivative (TD) measures the sensitivity of a given shape functional with respect to topological domain perturbations. The TD is used to determine the location of the small device placement, through a distributed control problem. By taking into account the effect of the disturbance term or uncertain input data in the TD expression, the problem of robustness to topological perturbation for the energy functional can be formulated as a minimax optimization problem with a pointwise observation. Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of the proposed topological derivative method."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396dab"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"35","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"69-81","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["681c5193fdbe835dc68bb196","681c5193fdbe835dc68bb197","5e709281878c28a047396dab","681c5193fdbe835dc68bb198"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478175","mniswId":"8624","title":"International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science","issn":"1641-876X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"dfc095e3-860a-4798-924f-bd64ed62bed8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67e26581fdbe834633e744fe","year":"2025","volume":"35","number":"1","documentHash":"f8e91e3c-329b-4eeb-a153-97dec828e9ad"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["topological derivative","shape optimization","optimal control","robust control"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061008425"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396bc2","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"945DA6E16C90D78458D39308A1998768752D49A1805D54917A3EEEB988E8787854B31A358F57E9D28580C67C5564546092D461B7FC627AD2653971B60EAC7769","orcidId":"0000-0002-9325-4493","documentHash":"01e9dce5-3b73-4594-8fdb-d41b3d8cee0d"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a04739603a","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Gątarek","uuid":"91922752C3DB560598E65B89A74C17C79A99A27233767AC28E7CBC14450D2FE4BA679334B9CCBB9B352B698B5463C126FFAD15DD060CC51C53419D4CF4A61070","orcidId":"0000-0002-0527-0945","documentHash":"776df795-73c6-4625-ac20-b47d026079ab"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-03-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"681c4d31fdbe835dc68b608d","doi":"10.3390/e27030320","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/e27030320","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Distribution Approach to Local Volatility for European Options in the Merton Model with Stochastic Interest Rates","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Dupire formula is a very useful tool for pricing financial derivatives. This paper is dedicated to deriving the aforementioned formula for the European call option in the space of distributions by applying a mathematically rigorous approach developed in our previous paper concerning the case of the Margrabe option. We assume that the underlying asset is described by the Merton jump-diffusion model. Using this stochastic process allows us to take into account jumps in the price of the considered asset. Moreover, we assume that the instantaneous interest rate follows the Merton model (1973). Therefore, in contrast to the models combining a constant interest rate and a continuous underlying asset price process, frequently observed in the literature, applying both stochastic processes could accurately reflect financial market behaviour. Moreover, we illustrate the possibility of using the minimal entropy martingale measure as the risk-neutral measure in our approach."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709274878c28a04739603a","5e70927e878c28a047396bc2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1-21","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927e878c28a047396bc2","5e709274878c28a04739603a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ae1","mniswId":"5774","title":"Entropy","issn":"1099-4300","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"08f80d14-1458-4b86-b80c-1f848af70f3a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"681c4d31fdbe835dc68b608e","year":"2025","volume":"27","number":"3","documentHash":"86fd84d3-acc3-4c8d-a175-77cb4c9b3471"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Dupire formula","European option","Merton model","local volatility","Schwartz distributions"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061017705"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"681df4d5fdbe83601a729538","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Skarżyńska","documentHash":"4d6b4b46-3ee4-4bcf-9351-82087c5a2005"},{"objectId":"5e709277878c28a0473963a3","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Romaniuk","uuid":"767BDD68EFA5D617757CE0EB29C53999238CB52E0AA86CE917F73BDFD3EF8E4EA86EAA08C5037B3EBED275679E39957688738506AED0E758BC9CD3BCF22336E6","orcidId":"0000-0001-9649-396X","documentHash":"0eb500bd-574a-4ea9-ace1-915ebc0afe47"}],"objectId":"681df4d5fdbe83601a729537","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-73997-2_19","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-73997-2_19","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"On Improvement of the DE-MCZ Algorithm with Modes Identification","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The DE-MCZ algorithm is an improvement of the DE-MC method, which joins the differential evolution with the theory of the Markov chains.

It seems that these new algorithms produce samples that can be considered as “similar, but not exactly the same” as the initial data, which is an important aim in the case of resampling methods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709277878c28a0473963a3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"277–288","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574192f","mniswId":"1073","fullName":"International Conference on Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty","shortName":"IPMU","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"c175b0b1-0ecd-4042-bf95-291275de1346"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"67d7fc3ffdbe83275d1d38da","startDate":"2024-07-22","endDate":"2024-07-26","fullName":"20th International Conference on Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty","shortName":"IPMU 2024","city":"Lisbon","country":"PT","website":"https://ipmu2024.inesc-id.pt/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"4786318a-f6bc-497c-a521-89a62eb47740"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["681df859fdbe83601a73092f","5e709277878c28a0473963a3"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"67d7df75fdbe83275d1c0ca4","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-73997-2","title":"Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems: 20th International Conference, IPMU 2024, Lisbon, Portugal, July 22-26, 2024, Proceedings, Volume 3","year":2025,"volume":"3","isbn":"978-3-031-73996-5","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-73997-2.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"b8ea25d1-e401-4c13-bb87-3265010165b7"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747061077256"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6784f618fdbe833b317fd07d","name":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","documentHash":"9a2ddb32-1c8a-4c98-9b41-57f1149e4e20"},{"objectId":"6784f618fdbe833b317fd07c","name":"Xinyuan","lastName":"Ji","documentHash":"a0e8f7b8-cb7a-4400-9217-8f398f02dece"},{"objectId":"6784f618fdbe833b317fd07b","name":"Hongyan","lastName":"Xing","documentHash":"9f003c11-1fb9-4926-94dc-5155e1dd7461"},{"objectId":"6784f618fdbe833b317fd07a","name":"Xu","lastName":"Yang","documentHash":"8ccf4790-c543-4c97-ac46-fcaf186fea42"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-04-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6784f618fdbe833b317fd078","doi":"10.1016/j.dcan.2024.03.010","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcan.2024.03.010","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Fuzzy clustering for electric field characterization and its application to thunderstorm interpretability","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Changes in the Atmospheric Electric Field Signal (AEFS) are highly correlated with weather changes, especially with thunderstorm activities. However, little attention has been paid to the ambiguous weather information implicit in AEFS changes. In this paper, a Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering method is used for the first time to develop an innovative approach to characterize the weather attributes carried by AEFS. First, a time series dataset is created in the time domain using AEFS attributes. The AEFS-based weather is evaluated according to the time-series Membership Degree (MD) changes obtained by inputting this dataset into the FCM. Second, thunderstorm intensities are reflected by the change in distance from a thunderstorm cloud point charge to an AEF apparatus. Thus, a matching relationship is established between the normalized distance and the thunderstorm dominant MD in the space domain. Finally, the rationality and reliability of the proposed method are verified by combining radar charts and expert experience. The results confirm that this method accurately characterizes the weather attributes and changes in the AEFS, and a negative distance-MD correlation is obtained for the first time. The detection of thunderstorm activity by AEF from the perspective of fuzzy set technology provides a meaningful guidance for interpretable thunderstorms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"299-307","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6784f618fdbe833b317fd07a","6784f618fdbe833b317fd07b","6784f618fdbe833b317fd07c","6784f618fdbe833b317fd07d","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bf2b","mniswId":"5080","title":"Digital Communications and Networks","issn":"2468-5925","eissn":"2352-8648","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"a3e21127-48eb-47a6-8465-9d6c8ef92841"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6821cb5afdbe8356e57b10e9","year":"2025","volume":"11","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"c468eea9-a115-465a-a63b-4fdd2ab10f3f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Atmospheric electric field (AEF)","Thunderstorm","Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)","Attribute"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747088288004"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67767a97fdbe833e69533fe5","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Bartoszuk","documentHash":"1ac0da05-bb1f-42b9-869d-fd5ed7be9c46"},{"objectId":"5ebed7e5752340254fc40d57","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Brzozowski","uuid":"225C182885739C178FCAE1C9A8E55D6106A7E2A4BCC19294A6ED836D35ADB47F8B9994C1C9CF7B228613D57CE982A412ED6160B2B340A53A3D7B55CF2485C8B8","documentHash":"e2b81be1-76cf-4421-8d6f-edd9f0f3d417"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f55","name":"Anna","lastName":"Cena","uuid":"E471B047EF6E34A5C8BDF0F979AB4BF1946A5EA8D960BFAB25895F722733C05ECA4C6BF33B11556BC110BB40A3E73DDDF0B2ABE6430A68039067E926C818A198","orcidId":"0000-0001-8697-5383","documentHash":"d7083ad9-6ac6-4806-90a9-add254e0e023"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395fcb","name":"Marek","lastName":"Gągolewski","uuid":"D1F789DA719ACDE4F786BBA60CF8D2DE726661D5A7E254F316F4820329A49BCFEEA3CF3ED30E610FD1925A22E44E517CE8570971F86F2FC086AC8F5C20BEE1C0","orcidId":"0000-0003-0637-6028","documentHash":"0308d267-3047-4e3d-a992-4311b211b0b2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-07-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"67767a97fdbe833e69533fe3","doi":"10.1007/s00357-024-09483-1","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00357-024-09483-1","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Clustering with Minimum Spanning Trees: How Good Can It Be?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Minimum spanning trees (MSTs) provide a convenient representation of datasets in numerous pattern recognition activities.

By identifying the upper bounds for the agreement between the best (oracle) algorithm and the expert labels from a large battery of benchmark data, we discover that MST methods can be very competitive. Next, we review, study, extend, and generalise a few existing, state-of-the-art MST-based partitioning schemes. This leads to some new noteworthy approaches. Overall, the Genie and the information-theoretic methods often outperform the non-MST algorithms such as K-means, Gaussian mixtures, spectral clustering, Birch, density-based, and classical hierarchical agglomerative procedures.

Significant progress in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and its wider use in many interactive products are quickly transforming further areas of our life, which results in the emergence of various new social phenomena. Many countries have been making efforts to understand these phenomena and find answers on how to put the development of artificial intelligence on the right track to support the common good of people and societies. These attempts require interdisciplinary actions, covering not only science disciplines involved in the development of artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction but also close cooperation between researchers and practitioners. For this reason, the main goal of the MIDI conference held on 9-10.12.2021 as a virtual event is to integrate two, until recently, independent fields of research in computer science: broadly understood artificial intelligence and human-technology interaction.\\nThis volume has been divided into two parts: (1) Machine Intelligence and (2) Digital Interaction. As a result, the chapters deal with such topics as weather classification, object detection, automatic translation in the scientific community. The remaining chapters of the volume refer to the matters pertaining to people’s behaviors in contact with virtual reality, use of virtual reality in psychological science, and to the issues that are

In order to obtain the numeric estimation along with its reliability, the construction of prediction intervals (PIs) is highly demanded by any practical applications as well as being long term for providing more information on future trends. Bearing this in mind, in this article, a hierarchical granular computing (HGrC)-based model is established for constructing long-term PIs, in which probabilistic modeling gives rise to a long horizon of numeric prediction, and the deployment of information granularities hierarchically extends the result to be interval-valued format. Considering that the structure of this model has a direct impact on its performance, Monte-Carlo search with a policy gradient technique is then applied for reinforcement structure learning. Compared with the existing methods, the size (length) of the granules in the proposed approach is unequal so that it becomes effective for not only periodic but also nonperiodic data. Furthermore, with the use of parallel strategy, the efficiency can be also guaranteed for real-world applications. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to other commonly encountered techniques, and the stability of the structure learning process behaves better when compared with other reinforcement learning approaches."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"52","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"666-676","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602951272467f026ee3e0da2","5e70922b878c28a047391011","602951272467f026ee3e0da3","602951272467f026ee3e0da4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fec","mniswId":"7967","title":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","issn":"2168-2267","eissn":"2168-2275","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"601369b6-3303-4225-ace9-83b182a8eb17"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dedeb02467f0772e660db8","year":"2022","volume":"52","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"83b3730b-5529-4bb5-9680-1f3f5e6b35ac"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Byproduct gas","hierarchical granular computing (HGrC)","prediction intervals (PIs)","reinforcement structure learning","steel industry"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654298805"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"602924862467f026ee3e0cb9","name":"Jinjin","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"0a37b3f6-0ef4-4604-99aa-26fa7371fce0"},{"objectId":"602924862467f026ee3e0cb8","name":"Wei-Zhi","lastName":"Wu","documentHash":"50ef0a36-8bdf-41cf-b4b0-189f19d17907"},{"objectId":"602924862467f026ee3e0cb7","name":"Suwei","lastName":"Shi","documentHash":"80e94176-4716-40f3-a62c-b0e5f1948741"},{"objectId":"602924862467f026ee3e0cb6","name":"Anhui","lastName":"Tan","orcidId":"0000-0002-2525-3499","documentHash":"8a5e7453-bfde-4112-9681-aae772cc20b8"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"602924862467f026ee3e0cb5","doi":"10.1109/tcyb.2020.2973379","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2020.2973379","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Granularity and Entropy of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Information and Their Applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A granular structure of intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) information presents simultaneously the similarity and diversity of samples. However, this structural representation has rarely displayed its technical capability in data mining and information processing due to the lack of suitable constructive methods and semantic interpretation for IF information with regard to real data. To pursue better performance of the IF-based technique in real-world data mining, in this article, we examine information granularity, information entropy of IF granular structures, and their applications to data reduction of IF information systems. First, several types of partial-order relations at different hierarchical levels are defined to reveal the granularity of IF granular structures. Second, the granularity invariance between different IF granular structures is characterized by using relational mappings. Third, Shannon's entropies are generalized to IF entropies and their relationships with the partial-order relations are addressed. Based on the theoretical analysis above, the significance of intuitionistic attributes using the information measures is then introduced and the information-preserving algorithm for data reduction of IF information systems is constructed. Finally, by inducing substantial IF relations from public datasets that take both the similarity/diversity between the samples from the same/different classes into account, a collection of numerical experiments is conducted to confirm the performance of the proposed technique."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"52","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"192-204","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602924862467f026ee3e0cb6","602924862467f026ee3e0cb7","602924862467f026ee3e0cb8","602924862467f026ee3e0cb9","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fec","mniswId":"7967","title":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","issn":"2168-2267","eissn":"2168-2275","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"601369b6-3303-4225-ace9-83b182a8eb17"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dedeb02467f0772e660db8","year":"2022","volume":"52","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"83b3730b-5529-4bb5-9680-1f3f5e6b35ac"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Attribute reduction","granular structure","granularity","information entropy","intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) relation","uncertainty measure"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654302803"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c32eef2467f01f29213b59","name":"Marek","lastName":"Bukowicki","documentHash":"334a3beb-3f33-43d0-a53d-6309c1821dc0"},{"objectId":"60c32eef2467f01f29213b58","name":"Karol","lastName":"Brzezinski","orcidId":"0000-0002-1634-3919","documentHash":"8680fbaa-b912-4f64-9dc6-ed08108c6f4e"},{"objectId":"5e709460878c28a0473bbb37","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kaczmarek-Majer","uuid":"0087CB6164DB0E85F06F1E33A2F188BD3B4D4B8B535FBDFD1B35F1237A1063F10FC364FE3B1DB1E69F4D42AE88BEBAA8DA8D9BFEBE15113835244D62D71574C8","documentHash":"506043a3-b093-402e-b5cf-5d2037ba7f11"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396bdb","name":"Karol","lastName":"Opara","uuid":"87EA036EA878A3AF690AA68ABBFA11F814645A1247FFEE0B145260F08486915D7264FB23206CE77E5E6D69ECB2F29E02A2B4BB26CF4FD8848EF1B2FB50A5D1E1","orcidId":"0000-0002-7149-4031","documentHash":"3748c6a9-f884-4526-9816-34166251ebc1"}],"objectId":"60c32eef2467f01f29213b57","doi":"10.1109/mits.2021.3049382","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9345727","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Road roughness estimation through smartphone-measured acceleration","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Driving on an uneven road causes vibration of the vehicle.

This study demonstrates the feasibility, accuracy, and repeatability of the accelerometer system for pavement evaluation that computes the international roughness index (IRI) using multiple smartphones to collect data. It uses quarter-car and half-car suspension models calibrated through rides on speed bumps or a section with a known profile. We report on a field test with eight runs over an 18.6-km route of urban asphalt roads. The correlation of our results with the reference laser profilometer IRI oscillates around 0.7 for a single measurement and reaches 0.85 in the case of using multiple sensors and repeated rides. We also demonstrate that inaccuracies in the spatial attribution of the road localization are a similarly important source of errors as the uncertainty related to mechanical models."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927e878c28a047396bdb","5e709460878c28a0473bbb37"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"209-220","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927e878c28a047396bdb","60c32eef2467f01f29213b58","60c32eef2467f01f29213b59","5e709460878c28a0473bbb37"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fb5","mniswId":"7898","title":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","issn":"1939-1390","eissn":"1939-1390","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"7729f80f-8bd1-4fca-bfb9-c9cfb8c8a527"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6231c6942467f0518534e68e","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"405d5de7-6627-4a18-879e-5cd29784c01d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Roads","Mathematical model","Vibrations","Rough surfaces","Smart phones","Sensors","Data models"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654425767"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde28","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Szelągowski","uuid":"27F74A4788BFD3CE18AFEB15DDFD6AF68BFD26DF42B08C891FC5799E5B821C30B1F9540493266D7BECFDE07FFF614A4D3046CB12C2036C95DBF88BD8E077B779","orcidId":"0000-0002-5114-6793","documentHash":"e3659fe9-4b80-4538-b542-c25ae66f4639"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Berniak-Woźny","uuid":"6138BF6B0A41DA74BFC258AA49BE7E5394626426404BA3AC8D242813245830AFA5AACE0908A279A3C7F928737C7621C8210C452F3DFC7AD46842090E2364BA3B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3156-5755","documentHash":"95feafe5-9ec4-4ca4-8cd3-ceb6bdadc6bf"}],"objectId":"6179446f2467f06ca1272bc8","doi":"10.1108/bpmj-01-2021-0012","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/BPMJ-01-2021-0012/full/html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Towards the assessment of business process knowledge intensity – a systematic literature review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose\nThe aim of the article is to propose an integrated definition of knowledge-intensive business processes (kiBPs) and a model of business process (BP) knowledge intensity and develop holistic criteria and measures for the assessment of BP knowledge intensity.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA qualitative systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out as a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to the research topic, in this case, BP knowledge intensity.

to give an in-depth understanding of the nature of business processes (BPs) from the perspective of their dynamism and knowledge intensity that will allow for their correct classification and provide practical and useful implications for their more relevant and effective management. A simple and low labor-intensive BP nature assessment approach is proposed that will allow for objective assessment and internal benchmarking of all BPs in a specific context of execution based on their nature.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe research is divided into two parts. The first comprises a systematic literature review (SLR) based on the resources of the ProQuest, Springer Nature and ScienceDirect full-text databases and the second includes illustrative case studies.\n\n\nFindings\nBuilding on the SLR, the authors identified and reviewed 3,385 articles and defined a set of criteria by which the nature of BPs can be assessed. Further, the authors proposed a BP nature assessment matrix together with complementary questionnaires for the evaluation of process dynamism and knowledge intensity.

The network is assumed to be operable if there is a path from the source to the terminal node, composed of operable elements. A cut-set is a set of elements whose failure ensures that no such path exists. A minimal cut-set contains no other cut-set. The method is based on the tree of loop-free paths connecting the two distinguished nodes. This tree, rather than the network structure itself, is analyzed with the aim of finding all minimal cut-sets, but it also serves to eliminate \"stub\" subnetworks not traversed by any loop-free path (the elements of a stub network do not belong to any minimal cut-set). The algorithm scans the tree from bottom to top producing a collection of sets of network elements at every multi-child node. Each obtained set is checked for being a minimal cut-set or a subset of one. In the first case the set is added to the list of minimal cut-sets, in the second - to the collection passed to the next step. When the last step is executed, the list of all minimal cut-sets is complete. It must be noted that the minimality and subminimality checks do not involve comparing a set to other sets, but are performed much faster using two theorems proved by the author. This feature makes the presented method faster than many other algorithms for generating minimal cut-sets, that identify them by comparing the newly obtained candidate sets with the previously obtained ones. Apart from being fast, the new algorithm is universal in the sense that it can be applied to networks in which some links are directed and some undirected. Furthermore, following the assumption that failures can affect both the links and the nodes, the cut-sets can be composed of these two types of elements rather than of links or nodes alone. This is an important property in view of the fact that many existing algorithms only find cut-sets composed of links, which strongly affects their applicability. Last but not least, if the tree of acyclic paths is limited to the paths not exceeding a given length, the presented algorithm finds all minimal cut-sets intersecting these paths, but leaves out cut-sets that intersect longer paths only. This aspect makes the algorithm suitable for the analysis of computer or transportation networks where a limit is often imposed on the length of a route."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a04739100c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1655-1661","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"63987d7e40970708596c736e","fullName":"European Safety and Reliability Conferences","shortName":"ESREL","website":"https://www.esrel2022.com/about","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"d4166633-a1b8-4b16-ab6e-2fe89f2f3c53"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"63987e0f40970708596c7bba","startDate":"2022-08-28","endDate":"2022-09-01","fullName":"32nd European Safety and Reliability Conference","shortName":"ESREL 2022","city":"Dublin","country":"IE","website":"https://www.esrel2022.com/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"62c31968-bce3-45ef-adea-3e3c782feb26"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a04739100c"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"63987f4a40970708596c8b26","title":"Proceedings of the 32nd European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL 2022)","year":2022,"isbn":"978-981-18-5183-4","url":"https://www.rpsonline.com.sg/proceedings/esrel2022/html/toc.html","translation":false,"documentHash":"76b90ce9-6158-4b48-9a1d-62a96dd8eee5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Network structure","Source/terminal node","Directed/undirected link","Tree of loop-free paths","Minimal cut-set","Cut-sets enumeration"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654669226"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6398838840970708596ccf44","name":"Christian","lastName":"Tanguy","documentHash":"146dcd1b-5b1a-431b-91a3-b1b02447cf59"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739100c","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":"1CF7E7126E77D10B28C94B1E5481F8C55BD4C2F14986D43F46FEEA67F45E681C5FC6DA57EA865A94DF0A21ECA5B4FD8980C09D5B520689EDB30B966581B98FC0","orcidId":"0000-0002-4413-1868","documentHash":"33c3049c-1764-44ae-b468-bc9666bb8f86"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"6398838840970708596ccf43","doi":"10.3850/978-981-18-5183-4_r29-04-375-cd","publicUri":"https://www.rpsonline.com.sg/proceedings/esrel2022/html/R29-04-375.xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Exact and Asymptotic Results for the Availability of Connected (2,2)-out-of-(m,n):F Lattice Systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"There has been a recent interest about the availability of connected (r,s)-out-of-(m,n):F lattice systems. Computing its exact value has been deemed a numerically complex task by Zhao et al. (2011) and Nashwan (2015). This calculation could be accomplished with less effort only in special cases as shown in Nakamura et al. (2018). Exact results have been proposed by Malinowski in 2021 for (2,2)-out-of-(m,n):F lattice systems, using recursive procedures and finding the exact system availability for m = 2, 3, 4.\nIn the present work, an alternate derivation of these results clearly demonstrating the recursive nature of the problem is proposed, which lends itself to symbolic computation. The recursion relations, as well as the associated generating functions, have been obtained for m up to 10. As n increases, the general solution exhibits an essentially power-law behavior, making numerical calculations very quick (O(1)) and accurate.\nFrom the obtained expressions when 2 ≤ m ≤ 10, improved upper and lower bounds to the true availability may be obtained for arbitrary m and n.

This leads to a nonlinear plate evolution equation with a nonlocal stretching active in the spanwise direction. The wind-flow in the chordwise direction is modeled through a piston-theoretic approximation, which provides both weak (frictional) dissipation and nonconservative forces. The long-time behavior of solutions is analyzed from various points of view. Compact global attractors, as well as fractal exponential attractors, are constructed using the recent quasi-stability theory. The nonconservative nature of the dynamics requires the direct construction of a uniformly absorbing ball, and this relies on the superlinearity of the stretching. For some parameter ranges, the nontriviality of the attractor is shown through the spectral analysis of the stationary linearized (non-self-adjoint) equation and the existence of multiple unimodal solutions is shown. Several stability results, obtained through energy estimates under various smallness conditions and/or assumptions on the equilibrium set, are also provided. Finally, the existence of a finite set of determining modes for the dynamics is demonstrated, justifying the usual modal truncation in engineering for the study of the qualitative behavior of suspension bridge dynamics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927d878c28a0473968d6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"39","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"457-500","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6231cfb02467f05185353197","6231cfb02467f05185353198","5e70927d878c28a0473968d6","6231cfb02467f0518535319a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477047","mniswId":"1171","title":"ANNALES DE L INSTITUT HENRI POINCARE-ANALYSE NON LINEAIRE","issn":"0294-1449","eissn":"1873-1430","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"9d3b733f-f969-42ac-aaa7-f7d7d4bb7ca9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6231d0612467f05185353349","year":"2022","volume":"39","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"511fbcec-4127-4b4d-b0c9-4d94e6182424"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Nonlinear plate equation","determining modes","nonconservative term","non-self-adjoint operator"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654678811"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6273a5ac40970720005a8979","name":"Yong","lastName":"Zhao","documentHash":"73ee664e-d838-4fd1-a64f-19c3455d7075"},{"objectId":"6273a5ac40970720005a8978","name":"Xiaoqian","lastName":"Chen","orcidId":"0000-0001-9255-3371","documentHash":"e98cacb9-40ce-4828-a9a9-6c21a3ba77fa"},{"objectId":"6273a5ac40970720005a8977","name":"Wen","lastName":"Yao","orcidId":"0000-0001-5224-9834","documentHash":"7bc05d19-320c-4156-bb82-66db18f016ba"},{"objectId":"6273a5ac40970720005a8975","name":"Ning","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"ce2432ec-6a7b-4590-ae15-306d34e8aa68"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"6273a5ac40970720005a8973","doi":"10.1109/tfuzz.2020.3039371","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9264752","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Disjunctive Fuzzy Neural Networks: A New Splitting-Based Approach to Designing a T–S Fuzzy Model","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article proposes a new network approach toward the implementation of Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy models referred to as disjunctive fuzzy neural networks (DJFNNs). The proposed DJFNN involves a novel network architecture and a greedy learning algorithm. Being different from the existing grid-based and clustering-based network architectures, the proposed architecture adds an OR neural layer positioned between the fuzzification layer and the rule layer. In this way, the implied constraint between the number of rules and the number of fuzzy labels is excluded so that a curse of dimensionality can be overcome and more interpretable models are formed. Furthermore, inspired by the core algorithm for building a decision tree, a top–down, nonbacktracking, and greedy algorithm is proposed to learn the unknown parameters of the networks. The input space splits into smaller and smaller subspace along the predefined fuzzy grids in a supervised manner meanwhile the associated conditions of the T–S fuzzy model are identified. The greedy algorithm is applicable to high-dimensional problems since there is no exponential growth in time or space as the dimensionality increases. The new network architecture and greedy learning algorithm make the proposed DJFNN a regression model of high interpretability and good prediction capability, particularly suitable for solving the high-dimensional problems. The DJFNN was experimented with using a synthetic dataset and 28 real-world datasets and compared with classical and state-of-the-art methods through nonparametric statistical tests. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the DJFNN in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and computational cost."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"370-381","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6273a5ac40970720005a8975","5e70922b878c28a047391011","6273a5ac40970720005a8977","6273a5ac40970720005a8978","6273a5ac40970720005a8979"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ff6","mniswId":"7978","title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS","issn":"1063-6706","documentHash":"e873763d-d418-440d-97ba-4fc19e1593ff"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6273a5ac40970720005a897b","year":"2022","volume":"30","number":"2","documentHash":"bb067430-881a-4ccb-9dc1-a551c14c666b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fuzzy neural networks","greedy algorithms","Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) model"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654679194"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aee361409707743b3249cf","name":"Francisco","lastName":"Blanquer","documentHash":"449974ea-4338-4de0-adb6-a7ce6a2bf320"},{"objectId":"63aee361409707743b3249ce","name":"Eduardo","lastName":"Garro","documentHash":"445451b2-c098-4be7-8068-f1a667d90d3d"},{"objectId":"63aee361409707743b3249cd","name":"Carlos E.","lastName":"Palau","documentHash":"f5e79b35-a6e5-437d-8453-987158b9917a"},{"objectId":"63aee361409707743b3249cc","name":"Ignacio","lastName":"Lacalle","documentHash":"6f1a549f-7746-4bf4-ae83-37fa96d6690e"},{"objectId":"63aee361409707743b3249cb","name":"Alejandro","lastName":"Fornés-Leal","documentHash":"6524c332-957f-4465-836e-bdfbb7676d75"},{"objectId":"5e709461878c28a0473bbde2","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Szmeja","uuid":"7CCB16B6E7E3B7851245DCD0C8DE2B86D2C529EFDB5B046FDD7D0854477A5B2F76DCE28990A01F0D1D36D257FA492BAAC4D5A2FF30A98547B07B90E40D448B42","orcidId":"0000-0003-0869-3836","documentHash":"aa3d82e8-bd2e-4f7b-b3c8-d7851a0d8c0e"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394e98","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Paprzycki","uuid":"5B7C90E72D40497375F5BA78D1C4DB9BB79A6D4D7BB177AD034994CA885AAF6ED7617D5EF01EEBCCF0178890D10A52D5AC35FE1F7603165AE8C861AE672BCCD5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8069-2152","documentHash":"3f20fd48-b1cd-4c97-952f-84211d07be00"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a04739297b","name":"Maria","lastName":"Ganzha","uuid":"FE26E0DC9CD7FD1F79C4A997D7DC8891B9C0EE91BFE7ED751B9AB870736888AA93D8E9937A2CD6224547116A9D8C7FEB856D1DF950682C0D3DEC77E6B271B193","orcidId":"0000-0001-7714-4844","documentHash":"e6181dd5-2e2f-4441-b7d3-6ba79a91c547"}],"objectId":"63aee361409707743b3249ca","doi":"10.3233/faia220243","publicUri":"https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/60792","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"ASSIST-IoT: A Reference Architecture for Next Generation Internet of Things","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"New requirements, posed by the Next Generation IoT, demand design of novel reference architectures, providing foundation for implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems.

Food webs are the physical foundations of ecosystems. Visualisations help to find and present structural patterns of these weighted networks and are essential in research, conservation practice and education. There has been no open-source library drawing weighted food webs with fractional trophic levels clearly. The existing approaches are scattered across separate libraries and programming languages.\n2. We provide an ensemble of mutually complementary visualisation methods that enable a general overview of the system, as well as a clear presentation of its details: https://github.com/ibs-pan/foodwebviz. We use colours, sizes, positions, zoom and movement for precise identification of flows, their magnitudes and connectivity patterns. Vertical positions of nodes highlight the fractional trophic level as the most significant structural variable in a food web. The visualisations are in the form of modular and extensible python functions. Jupyter notebooks display them interactively in HTML.\n3. A heat map of food web flows or diet proportions shows their general pattern at a glance while retaining their precise identification. An interactive graph allows tracing the flow of matter over subsequent links. The user can select nodes, zoom, adjust layout parameters and manually drag-and-drop nodes. An intuitive animation of particles moving between the nodes uses colours and time dimension to trace connections better. It shows the multivariate food web aspects in one graph, together with a structural indicator, the trophic level. A bar plot and a heat map summarise exchanges of matter between the trophic levels.\n4. We bring several complementary and customisable methods together to facilitate accompanying every food web publication and analysis with its visualisation. Users can tinker with the interactive output and method parameters to reach the desired effect. Aesthetically appealing images presenting empirical data help to communicate the importance of species interconnectedness and ecosystem complexity to the broader public. Visualisation tools facilitate incorporating real-world examples in education."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62da6ea140970752a1f0f3e0","5e709459878c28a0473baf87"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"57-64","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62da6ea140970752a1f0f3e0","5e709459878c28a0473baf87"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e59","mniswId":"14294","title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","issn":"2041-210X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"7a3da3ea-018f-4f5e-8995-11cf1970d044"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63eba1944097075ca5159f09","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"d0039a1c-0b4b-4858-aadc-1e11346978ba"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["food web","network visualisation","ecological network","animated flow network","interactive graph","trophic level","flow matrix heat map"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654689918"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63be90f640970720586f7db3","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Koniarski","documentHash":"5c9dbf8f-a4fa-4848-af85-664cd1e3cc6a"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b56","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Myśliński","uuid":"9C83A6F063FE2F720C598B9D6282690E1CA207C9AB0E4641DA3BDE6AFF4B49ABECFA96140FFED392345738558E0A1A081106E89DDBCB02EEC141F95294EAA7A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0909-3114","documentHash":"267fab46-c039-4419-9a82-95284b2ada39"}],"objectId":"63be90f640970720586f7db2","doi":"10.15439/2022f28","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.15439/2022f28","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A Modified ICP Algorithm Based on FAST and Optical Flow for 3D Registration","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a modified Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm based on a suitable selection of initial points and local optical flow to speed up registration of static scenes with high accuracy. The biggest disadvantages of using standard ICP algorithm are appropriate initialization and effective matching point step in each iteration. In the proposed modification we deal with these problems and optimize this method for Augmented Reality application. As this application uses RGB-D images sequence the changes between consecutive key-frames are small. Therefore only small subset of the source image key-points is selected using scale-space pyramid and FAST approaches. It leads to the significant reduction of the number of the processed image points. Since the point matching technique using local optical flow is applied, in each optimization step of ICP the costly point matching procedure can be abandoned.

The performance suffers from individual differences in corresponding time to MI tasks. In order to solve the problem, in this study, we propose a novel method named Riemannian sparse optimization and Dempster-Shafer fusion of multi-time-frequency patterns (RSODSF) to enhance the decoding efficiency. First, we effectively combine the Riemannian geometry of the spatial covariance matrix with sparse optimization to extract more robust and distinct features. Second, the Dempster-Shafer theory is introduced and used to fuse each time window after sparse optimization of Riemannian features. Besides, the probabilistic values of the support vector machine (SVM) are obtained and transformed to effectively fuse multiple classifiers to leverage potential soft information of multiple trained SVM. The openaccess BCI Competition IV dataset IIa and Competition III dataset IIIa are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed RSODSF. It achieves higher average accuracy (89.7% and 96.8%) than state-of-the-art methods. The improvement over the common spatial patterns (SFBCSP) are respectively 9.9% and 12.4% (p<0.01, paired t-test).

The approach presented in this paper is designed to examine if unlabeled data can improve the accuracy of classification tasks in the considered case study of classifying a patient's state. First, unlabeled data are represented by clusters membership through Fuzzy C-means algorithm which corresponds to the uncertainty of the patient's condition in this disease. Secondly, the classification is performed using two well-known algorithms, Random Forest and SVM. The obtained results indicate a minimal improvement in the quality of classification thanks to the use of membership in clusters.

For example, reduced speech activity, changes in specific voice features, and pause-related measures were found to be sensitive markers of depressive symptoms. Considering the possibility of continuous speech data collection via a smartphone app, voice analysis has great potential for monitoring mental states. Nevertheless, there is still a need to select the most effective validation approaches for solving the task of predicting the mental state. Those validation approaches shall consider that the data collected from sensors and the response variables considered in this BD application problem are subject to various sources of uncertainty. The aim of the study is to perform an experimental evaluation of the accuracy of top-performing crisp and fuzzy methods, such as Naive Bayes Network, SOTA algorithm, Fuzzy Rule, Probabilistic Neural Network, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Tree, Random Forest, Tree Ensemble, and an ensemble approach that combines them. Various training and testing scenarios are considered for each of these methods, consisting of a given percentage of all observations. Additionally, the results from multiple methods are aggregated using the dominant function. Thus, the most frequent rating is taken and a metric based on fuzzy numbers is also considered for comparative purposes. The preliminary results of numerical experiments are promising. The sensitive point is the vicinity of the threshold of transition to a disease state. It should be noted that due to minor differences inherent in such cases, it seems intuitive to use fuzzy numbers to determine the patient’s assessment. Experiments confirmed also that the ranking of methods depends on the choice of the training set and evaluation metric."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709460878c28a0473bbb37"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157417a7","mniswId":"649","fullName":"IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","shortName":"FUZZ-IEEE","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"6ff20ffd-a184-431f-85f7-26401a0dd5fd"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"632d79814097073ab8827a58","startDate":"2022-07-18","endDate":"2022-07-23","fullName":"2022 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","shortName":"FUZZ-IEEE","city":"Padua","country":"IT","website":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9882530/proceeding","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"68b4eb74-95ed-41c0-b44a-9c1bf2855655"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709460878c28a0473bbb37","5e709277878c28a04739636f"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"634534be4097077ad4d81dc3","doi":"10.1109/fuzz-ieee55066.2022","title":"2022 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","year":2022,"isbn":"978-1-6654-6710-0","issn":"1558-4739","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9882530/proceeding","translation":false,"documentHash":"5dfe0bd9-98d9-4f83-8e54-af765a647cbf"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["intelligent data analysis","experimental evaluation","classification","bipolar disorder monitoring","smartphone data","speech processing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654698524"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d8fd8b409707399491a23d","name":"Gvantsa","lastName":"Tsulaia","documentHash":"f074d495-fc46-427a-98fc-5c509339c748"},{"objectId":"63d8fd8b409707399491a23c","name":"Gia","lastName":"Sirbiladze","documentHash":"f2368a7b-f45a-47a4-a608-c036bee61443"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391000","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kacprzyk","uuid":"4A8B2CA444BD6ED60EACF6DE687FF3AF9E95EF07222C91937E5CA1F185E2124FF08DCD7D9A596E8E60911E67B522D3EBFC737B67D6B4294639E916338A719CCB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4187-5877","documentHash":"13701ef2-8325-46ae-a25f-9758ec64477a"}],"objectId":"63d8fd8b409707399491a23a","doi":"10.1142/s0219622022500146","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219622022500146","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Associated Fuzzy Probabilities in MADM with Interacting Attributes: Application in Multi-Objective Facility Location Selection Problem","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"For decreasing service centers’ selection risks in emergency facility location selection, it is crucial to have selected candidate service centers within deeply detailed facility location selection model. To achieve this, a new approach developed in this article involves two stages. In the first stage, the fuzzy multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) model for evaluation of the selection of candidate service centers is created. For the aggregation of experts’ assessments of candidate service centers (with respect to attributes) aggregation operators’ approach is used. Experts’ assessments are presented in fuzzy terms with semantic form of triangular fuzzy numbers. For the deeply detailed facility location selection modeling and for the intellectual activity of experts in their evaluations, pairwise interactions between attributes of MAGDM model are considered in the construction of the second-order additive triangular fuzzy valued fuzzy measure (TFVFM). The associated triangular fuzzy probability averaging (As-TFPA) aggregation operators’ family is constructed with respect to TFVFM. Analytical properties of the As-TFPA operators are studied. The new operators are certain extensions of the well-known Choquet integral operator. The extensions, in contrast to the Choquet aggregation, consider all possible pair-wise interactions of the attributes by introducing associated fuzzy probabilities of a TFVFM. At the end of the first stage, a candidate service center’s selection index is defined as As-TFPA operator’s aggregation value on experts’ assessments with respect to attributes.\n\nAt the second stage, fuzzy multi-objective facility location set covering problem (MOFLSCP) is created for facility location selection optimal planning with new criteria: (1) maximization of candidate service centers selection index and classical two criteria, (2) minimization of the total cost needed to open service centers and (3) minimization of number of agents needed to operate the opened service centers.\n\nFor the constructed two-stage methodology a simulation example of emergency service facility location planning for a city is considered. The example gives the Pareto fronts obtained by As-TFPA operators, the Choquet integral-TFCA operator and well-known TOPSIS approach, for optimal selecting candidate sites for the servicing of demand points. The comparative analysis identifies that the differences in the Pareto solutions, obtained by using As-TFPA operators and TFCA operator or TOPSIS aggregation, are also caused by the fact that TFCA operator or TOPSIS approach considers the pair interaction indexes for only one consonant structure of attributes. While new As-TFPA aggregations provide all pairwise interactions for all consonant structures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391000"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"21","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1155-1188","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a047391000","63d8fd8b409707399491a23c","63d8fd8b409707399491a23d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547822a","mniswId":"9030","title":"International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making","issn":"0219-6220","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e762d190-0a89-4bad-83ca-7bb52eb32601"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d8fd8b409707399491a23b","year":"2022","volume":"21","number":"4","documentHash":"100148a7-0d16-41b0-a4f0-c1a7d3bdf059"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Associated fuzzy probabilities of a fuzzy measure","Choquet integral","fuzzy aggregation operators","interacting fuzzy MAGDM","fuzzy multi-objective facility location set covering problem","service center’s selection index","Pareto front"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654701935"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d11d1b40970711f8f9ca6b","name":"Junhao","lastName":"Wen","documentHash":"aebd84f0-1b71-4122-a3bc-f0888248a999"},{"objectId":"63d11d1b40970711f8f9ca6a","name":"Fuyuan","lastName":"Xiao","documentHash":"51a33b75-dba4-44bb-b906-a31f655886cb"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"63d11d1b40970711f8f9ca68","doi":"10.1109/tkde.2022.3177896","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9782586","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Generalized Divergence-based Decision Making Method with an Application to Pattern Classification","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In decision-making systems, how to address uncertainty plays an important role for the improvement of system performance in uncertainty reasoning. Dempster—Shafer evidence (DSE) theory is an effective method to address uncertainty in decision-making problems by means of basic belief assignments (BBAs) and Dempster's combination rule. In the DSE theory, divergence measure between BBAs, which is beneficial for conflict information management in decision making, remains an open issue. In this paper, several generalized evidential divergences (EDs) are proposed and studied to measure the difference and discrepancy between BBAs in DSE theory, which have more universal applicability in decision theory. On this basis, a uniform BJS divergence-based decision-making algorithm is devised to improve the decision level. Furthermore, the extensions of weighted BJS to decision-making algorithms are discussed by considering not only subjective weights but also objective weights. Notably, this is the first work to propose the weighted BJS divergence in DSE theory providing a promising way to analyze decision-making problems from different perspectives. Finally, the proposed BJS-based decision-making algorithm is applied to pattern classification. The results validate that the proposed decision-making algorithm is beneficial for diverse real-world datasets and outperforms several well-known related works and demonstrates higher classification accuracy as well as robustness."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"35","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"6941-6956","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d11d1b40970711f8f9ca6a","63d11d1b40970711f8f9ca6b","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478003","mniswId":"7990","title":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","issn":"1041-4347","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"febb011e-59f0-4d1a-a72b-56e3164f2945"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6490136240970747b95cc36a","year":"2023","volume":"35","number":"7","doi":"","documentHash":"2dbf2307-830e-41c5-8bcd-6f34c34917b0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Dempster-Shafer evidence theory","Belief function","Evidential divergence","Weighted Belief-Jensen-Shannon divergence","Belief entropy","Conflict management","Decision-making","Pattern classification"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654702074"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d97aae4097073994993bb4","name":"Enrique","lastName":"Herrera-Viedma","documentHash":"055cf032-62c0-4a76-b955-40c5b67c623a"},{"objectId":"63d97aae4097073994993bb3","name":"Juan Antonio","lastName":"Morente-Molinera","documentHash":"caade2fa-4870-4135-a460-77fcdb64266e"},{"objectId":"63d97aae4097073994993bb2","name":"Francisco","lastName":"Javier Cabrerizo","documentHash":"0424141d-0f61-4edd-9599-1530eb459ff1"},{"objectId":"63d97aae4097073994993bb1","name":"Jose Ramon","lastName":"Trillo","documentHash":"6ee57dc1-6a7b-4ec0-9eba-3b14d65b7563"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739101f","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Zadrożny","uuid":"C34AE9CE91E6A1B4C123DDE8FEA58BD66D2144E8AD5551ED1D54D774E4A2E152FA2ADDBF74E3FB1377E7B6BBD67255F2566A7E10A1E4194429AEDCFFD702F891","orcidId":"0000-0002-6642-0927","documentHash":"bb76266c-0da9-4d75-83ef-53badcb12c83"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391000","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kacprzyk","uuid":"4A8B2CA444BD6ED60EACF6DE687FF3AF9E95EF07222C91937E5CA1F185E2124FF08DCD7D9A596E8E60911E67B522D3EBFC737B67D6B4294639E916338A719CCB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4187-5877","documentHash":"13701ef2-8325-46ae-a25f-9758ec64477a"}],"objectId":"63d97aae4097073994993bb0","doi":"10.1109/is57118.2022.10019687","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10019687","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Large-Scale Group Decision-Making Method based on Trust Clustering among Experts","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A group decision-making process is considered which is meant as that a group of experts (agents, decision-makers,…) rank a finite set of options from the best to the worst. A special class of such processes is discussed in which the number of experts is large or indeterminate, the so-called Large-Scale Group Decision-Making. In this type of process, a key factor is trust in making a decision and evaluating an alternative, and the problem of managing the trust of agents is in this type of process complex and challenging. In this paper, a new approach to the management of trust in a Large-Scale Group Decision-Making system is presented. For this purpose, clusters are formed based on two factors: the mutual trust that agents have for each other and the similarity of opinions. If these two conditions are met, the experts are grouped into a single cluster. In this way, it is possible to manage the trust of experts and to apply it to the formulation and solution of a Large-Scale Group Decision-Making system. It is also possible to detect isolated points, which are clusters of single experts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a04739101f","5e70922b878c28a047391000"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"291-298","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157417b3","mniswId":"661","fullName":"IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Systems","shortName":"IEEE IS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"e88f34db-c7ff-4df4-9eb7-e5b13c09d7ee"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"63d978e64097073994992d80","startDate":"2022-10-12","endDate":"2022-10-14","fullName":"IEEE 11th International Conference on Intelligent Systems","shortName":"IS’22","city":"Warsaw","country":"PL","website":"http://ieee-is-2022.ibspan.waw.pl/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"f70eebed-d68c-4380-a7cb-8bde2c5100af"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d97aae4097073994993bb1","63d97aae4097073994993bb2","63d97aae4097073994993bb3","63d97aae4097073994993bb4","5e70922b878c28a04739101f","5e70922b878c28a047391000"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"63d9799b40970739949930fe","doi":"10.1109/is57118.2022","title":"2022 IEEE 11th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS)","year":2022,"isbn":"978-1-6654-5656-2","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10019601/proceeding","translation":false,"documentHash":"d8d15e50-6159-4a38-a0c2-09cce810f244"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Large-Scale Group Decision-Making System","Clustering","Trust","Group Decision Making Method"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654702354"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"643a82a24097076e1e9e8846","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Matejko","documentHash":"368af78b-563d-488e-9228-799d99980773"},{"objectId":"643a82a24097076e1e9e8845","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Mentel","documentHash":"5efbb81b-445b-4310-8adf-78b293062dc6"},{"objectId":"643a82a24097076e1e9e8844","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Brozyna","documentHash":"a71be5b5-77e6-4905-bcc2-22259f8fceb1"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abf45","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Gajowniczek","uuid":"29A06E652603B456E5474ED16F1885A9909E699E41C8492FF85EEC65C1200AEE650B9A5AD9AD4A226F9923EF02261AB4BFEE77EA7010B3229FA077FC06C2BA3B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6953-8907","documentHash":"cb123988-d4d8-495a-8bb0-d247c80954ab"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396e01","name":"Anna","lastName":"Olwert","uuid":"FF080CE621C40DAE845999FCE62BA9DA4E71A50F6D9280AAC82B52B37ABD879BCD9CCF8341DE8F246328F628BF258E2295427EA9C7E9BD82368733D59D9C0439","documentHash":"b117238f-4bfb-4b2a-9ccf-b98f1a1fb47e"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396d6a","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Radziszewska","uuid":"8E5B3D4F2229E091232F7FDB796D799204A62276E271D3FFBF18EE580CDFE3667814568EDA0E755D1038A5320161E62E7B3A80CEF66A383CA2A6B3424117E9E4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2958-5156","documentHash":"892b1ec9-c68f-461a-8141-e59b466b482b"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047396044","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Charytanowicz","uuid":"21B4690A4BBE001432456F66E7090F86CB9A837C1A26B40EAA0C92795E0BA562456C2700DB0D9818B093E02CA2212B006F27193FB57CEB42EABF419028D2AD15","orcidId":"0000-0002-1956-3941","documentHash":"a50ee15d-4d4a-422e-b630-ac83ca9abfde"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a047394204","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Ząbkowski","uuid":"17BA1DBFDAFA46CB76CFCD9ABB73D0D327C46FEE069E3377B92374B70EEE2942E6E23D84818C9E29459E0B631AF8441715DC3FCE9EE257543D3E29E56BDAFAB1","orcidId":"0000-0003-1722-1179","documentHash":"344a838c-2bec-437a-b381-7c4d5112fdea"},{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f6d5","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Jarnicka","uuid":"D89A3AD0F0006A1CAE8FB8F480CF5F506C765170E05BA02266604D6796EC18EB4DBD6CBD59E026C48BF52283AFD8EA45A4CEF64310994EFE244228057C522E73","documentHash":"7c7d8f1f-28b3-41db-b615-a50e43b3b453"}],"objectId":"643a82a24097076e1e9e883f","doi":"10.1109/is57118.2022.10019658","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10019658","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Machine Learning for Energy Load Prediction and its Interpretation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper refers to real-life data on energy consumption from three companies, connected to a medium voltage grid. The companies use single-, two-, or three-zone tariffs and the general characteristic of their activity is comparable. The input dataset contains hourly electricity consumption recorded from January 2020 to December 2020. The independent variables used for the study include weather, time-dependent factors, and aggregated energy factors. We perform the prediction of consumption using three methods: naive, multiple regression, and extreme gradient boosting regression. The performance of the methods is compared based on the MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE metrics. The study shows that the scores achieved for the extreme gradient boosting method are higher than for the multiple regression. To gain the interpretability of the energy load forecasting and feature analysis the Shapley additive explanations method is used for the best model. As a result, a ranking of the most important factors is created. It shows the importance of aggregated energy factors and weather conditions while placing daylight and season at the bottom of the ranking."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii

path regularization for handling label uncertainty in semi-supervised learning: use case in bipolar disorder monitoring","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Semi-supervised learning has gained great interest because of its ability to combine unlabeled data with – potentially few – labeled observations in a training process. However, in some application contexts, one can question whether all available labels are equally valid. For example, in the context of bipolar disorder (BD) remote monitoring, a common practice is to extrapolate the psychiatrist’s assessment onto some fixed time window surrounding the visit, the so-called ground truth period. In consequence, all data from this period are labeled with the same category. Such an approach may potentially result in misguided supervision affecting the model’s performance. In this paper, we consider the problem of label uncertainty, assuming that the labels are crisp, but they may be assigned to particular observations with varying confidence. We propose a novel method called Confidence Path Regularization (CPR) that incorporates this uncertainty into the fuzzy c-means semi-supervised learning. The proposed CPR approach is a novel method for automatic, data-driven handling of label uncertainty. We achieve it by estimating the confidence factor for each labeled observation. In addition, CPR allows for the exploration of potential class-specific patterns in the adjusted confidence. The proposed method is illustrated with experiments on partially labeled data about speech characteristics collected from smartphone application for BD monitoring. In this particular applied scenario, we also use additional contextual data to improve the construction of confidence paths. It is shown that the proposed CPR approach enables to reflect the varying confidence in labels as compared with the nominal approach which assigns the majority of observations to the same class associated with relevant ground truth period."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["616644a875234017e052cae5","5e709232878c28a0473918ef","5e709460878c28a0473bbb37"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157417a7","mniswId":"649","fullName":"IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","shortName":"FUZZ-IEEE","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"6ff20ffd-a184-431f-85f7-26401a0dd5fd"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"632aae8640970732c4ac7e68","startDate":"2022-07-18","endDate":"2022-07-23","fullName":"2022 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","shortName":"FUZZ-IEEE 2022","city":"Padua","country":"IT","website":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9882530/proceeding","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"bd7561c6-90ab-42a4-a5a1-ffeb98412307"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["616644a875234017e052cae5","63b207b340970703c60da900","63b207b340970703c60da901","5e709232878c28a0473918ef","5e709460878c28a0473bbb37"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"632aae8640970732c4ac7e67","title":"2022 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)","year":2022,"isbn":"978-1-6654-6711-7","issn":"1558-4739","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9882530/proceeding","translation":false,"documentHash":"7214f785-4146-40e5-b886-20ba4b2f9006"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["semi-supervised learning","prediction","label uncertainty","weak learning","regularization","bipolar disorder","process monitoring","acoustic features","smartphones","intelligent data analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654749613"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709352878c28a0473a7475","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Skowron","uuid":"5F1926B596FC713500F3E6B7D9075D38399B5A8382DDA7CD65F7F176BEE2523B3D39BADA38F6A62E5C00027AFA887B23F2F8DC823D59FC8F6BD0A565B1833A9C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5271-6559","documentHash":"feedcacc-b75a-4e42-9ceb-fc9cef69a6f5"},{"objectId":"5e70933c878c28a0473a56d0","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Ślęzak","uuid":"ED8F8DEE018777326FDC3F06A6560F1BB2BB42570E2190FB890DBE888CA741EE8009F4EEA588A53902F3D5DA39664A0403E3495FFDF4D3F75B792A0ECA857304","orcidId":"0000-0003-2453-4974","documentHash":"d705d0b9-b647-47cb-bfba-295564b891da"}],"objectId":"63b2b98e4097074fedff6b44","doi":"10.15439/2022f310","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.15439/2022f310","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Rough Sets Turn 40: From Information Systems to Intelligent Systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The theory of rough sets was founded by Zdzisław Pawlak as a framework for data and knowledge exploration. His seminal paper titled \"Rough Sets\" was published in 1982, in International Journal of Computer and Information Sciences. One of the key aspects that lets us use rough sets in practical scenarios is the notion of information system, which comes from even earlier Professor Pawlak’s works. Information systems are the means for data and knowledge representation. They constitute the input to rough set mechanisms aimed at computing approximations of concepts and deriving compacted, interpretable decision models. In particular, the fundamental notion of the indiscernibility relation is defined on the basis of a given information system. Accordingly, we discuss to what extent information systems can serve as the basis for intelligent systems. We claim that in many cases it is not enough to treat a data set – represented as an information system – as a purely abstract object with no linkage to the data origins. Oppositely, we should give ourselves a technical possibility to construct information systems dynamically, taking into account interaction with physical environments where the data comes from. With this respect, we refer to the notions of interactive granular computing and we generally consider together the paradigms of rough sets, information systems, and information granulation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1a","uid":"bo-gzHUCaPNoq216Hhf4uRQ","uuid":"04d8f337-6a41-4c73-b0ee-a3f1a9293995","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Informatyki i Mechaniki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933c878c28a0473a56d0"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709352878c28a0473a7475"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"23-34","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"61b9ae66ad204581b62ebbd8","mniswId":"2222","fullName":"CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS","shortName":"FedCSIS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"8eb81c65-25da-4c93-b8c5-29c2918b99a5"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"63341ec64097070fbdd5e91d","startDate":"2022-09-04","endDate":"2022-09-07","fullName":"17th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems","shortName":"FedCSIS 2022","city":"Sofia","country":"BG","website":"https://fedcsis.org/2022/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"24252ad8-38f0-47bf-9438-c0931742532d"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709352878c28a0473a7475","5e70933c878c28a0473a56d0"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"633c2e884097074f7353202f","doi":"10.15439/978-83-962423-9-6","title":"Proceedings of the 17th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems","year":2022,"volume":"30","isbn":"9788396242396","issn":"2300-5963","url":"https://annals-csis.org/Volume_30/","translation":false,"documentHash":"96aa03c8-dc13-4bbe-b7b2-aa684079cc1c"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Rough Sets","Information Systems","Data Mining","Big Data","Interactive Granular Computing","Intelligent Systems"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654749629"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d125ec40970711f8fb91c2","name":"Zhiwu","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"01494bbe-5d92-4a6b-b910-16b7f3c34a03"},{"objectId":"63d125ec40970711f8fb91c1","name":"Ye","lastName":"Cui","documentHash":"32c0c536-96e9-4a8b-a45e-379484169cf5"},{"objectId":"63d125ec40970711f8fb91c0","name":"Hanyu","lastName":"E","documentHash":"c0ff8572-5bfa-4f13-878d-cd8a0e7a58ed"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"63d125ec40970711f8fb91be","doi":"10.1109/tfuzz.2020.3048577","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9311791","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Fuzzy Relational Matrix Factorization and Its Granular Characterization in Data Description","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article is concerned with a problem of relational factorization which engages fuzzy relational calculus. It forms an interesting alternative to the method of nonnegative matrix factorization that has been commonly discussed and found in numerous applications. The relational factorization takes original n -dimensional data located in the unit hypercube and factorizes it into data of lower dimensionality and some fuzzy relations. Owing to the logic nature of processing delivered by relational calculus, the dimensionality reduction exhibits transparency as the reduction mechanism itself is described in terms of logic expressions. Two types of factorizations mechanisms are investigated by using s–t and t–s composition operators where t and s are triangular norms and conorms, respectively. A two-level process of factorization is designed. A gradient-based learning scheme is developed. The quantification of the performance of the factorization process is realized by bringing a concept of information granularity: The obtained fuzzy relations are formed based on granular constructs and the quality of the produced factorization is assessed in terms of the coverage and specificity of the obtained granular results. A collection of experiments is included to present the performance of factorization and its parametric analysis. In addition, the proposed algorithm comes with sound interpretability in terms of both the structure of the model and an intuitive meaning of the fuzzy relations being the result of factorization."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"794-804","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d125ec40970711f8fb91c0","63d125ec40970711f8fb91c1","5e70922b878c28a047391011","63d125ec40970711f8fb91c2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ff6","mniswId":"7978","title":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issn":"1063-6706","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2707d48e-bd2d-4094-8688-dbcf61c20fb1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d125ec40970711f8fb91bf","year":"2022","volume":"30","number":"3","documentHash":"6e814a66-e0bd-4df9-88ab-f01d21d9d64d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["information granules","learning","logic processing","relational calculus","relational factorization"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654752690"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d244a040970773d539d7b5","name":"Duoqian","lastName":"Miao","documentHash":"b2da7c67-8ff4-43e8-95e3-fb38741ba18f"},{"objectId":"63d244a040970773d539d7b4","name":"Tianna","lastName":"Zhao","documentHash":"a7ba3586-5e4c-4c6b-bdbc-300920011d8d"},{"objectId":"63d244a040970773d539d7b3","name":"Yuanjian","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"e456765b-b457-4ff6-b548-a2428ab77110"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"63d244a040970773d539d7b1","doi":"10.1109/tsmc.2021.3062714","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9377714","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Granular Multilabel Batch Active Learning With Pairwise Label Correlation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Abundant data with limited labeling are a widespread bottleneck in multilabel learning. Active learning (AL) is an effective solution to gradually enhance model robustness, however how to effectively extend instance selection criteria to multilabel case remains challenging. Considering the label specificity and label correlation, a granular batch mode-based ranking active model for the multilabel (GBRAML) is proposed. Taking a bottom-up view, three granulation operators are successively constructed to formulate three granular structures. In low-level granulation operator, auxiliary label is introduced to enhance the informativeness and representativeness of each label. The contribution of labels to the usefulness of instances is incorporated with pair-wise label correlation, and is considered in the middle-level granulation operator. The labeling priority is determined by ranking the scorings coming from high-level granulation operator. To alleviate the impact of skewed label correlation, we take a three-way strategy on fitness of representative label correlation, thus a three-way GBRAML model (TGBRAML) is devised. Extensive experiments on six multilabel benchmark demonstrate GBRAML gains 5.4% and 210.1% improvement on MicroF1 and Average Precision over state-of-the-art batch mode multilabel active learning. The effectiveness of three-way decisions in multilabel AL is also verified."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"52","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"3079-3091","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d244a040970773d539d7b3","63d244a040970773d539d7b4","63d244a040970773d539d7b5","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478021","mniswId":"8021","title":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","issn":"2168-2216","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b54395d2-53aa-4fe8-8073-e4841966b519"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d244a040970773d539d7b2","year":"2022","volume":"52","number":"5","documentHash":"d3264e02-0a3f-4035-8286-8ee06be1e337"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Active learning","batch mode","granular computing (GrC)","label correlation","multilabel","three-way decisions"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654752877"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c968214097074220cfce75","name":"Yu.

The first stage is to make each agent converge to its own locally optimal state (the minimizer of local cost function) from any initial value in fixed time by designing distributed local optimization controllers. The second one is to realize the goal that all agents achieve the globally optimal state (the minimizer of global cost function) in fixed time under the distributed global optimization protocol. During the second stage of the proposed algorithm, each agent only communicates with its neighbors at event-triggered instants. Hence, comparing to the continuous communication optimization algorithm, our method has the advantage in the terms of saving the communication resources. Furthermore, Zeno behavior is avoided under such control strategy. The proposed algorithm in this paper can ensure that all agents achieve the globally optimal state in fixed time, which is independent of agents’ initial values and decided by some tunable parameters. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented optimization algorithm is demonstrated by a simulation example."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1154-1162","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ce844a4097072e2fc847dd","63ce844a4097072e2fc847de","5e709200878c28a04738e75e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c33a","mniswId":"8001","title":"IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering","issn":"2327-4697","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"a3d7f07c-259b-425b-b276-d807cbcefe03"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ce77e74097072e2fc72d34","year":"2022","volume":"9","number":"3","documentHash":"5a3c0a40-fbee-4048-9921-966c195e7ed0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fixed-time distributed optimization","event-triggered control","strongly convex optimization","consensus"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654753094"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d27d4640970773d5406459","name":"Zunwei","lastName":"Fu","documentHash":"a9068bc3-3369-4d8f-bd10-1686f04ef2b9"},{"objectId":"63d27d4640970773d5406458","name":"Eun-Hu","lastName":"Kim","documentHash":"c23a700d-b823-459e-8e43-931e46e585b1"},{"objectId":"63d27d4640970773d5406457","name":"Sung-Kwun","lastName":"Oh","documentHash":"886ca596-3114-47ee-8af7-9f53c40a0229"},{"objectId":"63d27d4640970773d5406456","name":"Zheng","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"23826d2f-d90f-4e92-b2b8-630510c1d774"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63d27d4640970773d5406455","doi":"10.1109/access.2022.3140397","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9669948","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Hierarchically Reorganized Multi-Layer Fuzzy Neural Networks Architecture Driven With the Aid of Node Selection Strategies and Structural Network Optimization","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, a design methodology based on fuzzy sets inference and polynomial neural network(PNN) for hierarchically reorganized self-organizing network architecture is introduced to cope with over-fitting as well as multi-collinearity problems which generally appear in a conventional fuzzy neural network. The design method of the proposed self-organizing network structure provides an efficient solution to construct the hierarchically reorganized multi-layer fuzzy neural networks (HRmFNN) architecture through a synergy of multi-techniques such as L 2 -norm regularization, probability theory, and multi-optimization. The overall network structure is realized with the aid of parallel network structure with newly added inputs as well as effective neuron selection method through the exponential-based roulette selection technique for each layer in HRmFNN, and the least square error estimation (LSE)-based learning method with L2-norm regularization is used for constructing the stabilized network architecture, and their ensuring design methodologies result in alleviating the overfitting phenomenon and also enhancing the generalization ability. For the performance enhancement of HRmFNN directly affected by some parameters such as the number of input variables, collocation of the specific subset of input variables, the number of membership functions per each variable, and the order of polynomial in the consequent parts of the fuzzy rules, multi-particle swarm optimization (MPSO) is exploited for the effectively structural as well as parametric optimization of the proposed network. That is, the multi-optimization helps achieve a compromise between the better generation performance and the alleviated over-fitting leading to the stabilization of the proposed multi-layered self-organizing network structure with the aid of synergistic multi-techniques such as a) L 2 -norm regularization-based LSE learning, b) probability theory for effective neuron selection, and c) novel parallel network structure including newly added inputs and neuron selection method.

Granular computing provides a potential strategy for representing and dealing with time series at a higher level of abstraction. In this study, we propose an information granulation-based weighted fuzzy C-means (wFCM) method to realize time-series clustering, which could avoid high dimensionality processing and provide a concise and visible granular prototype for each cluster. In this method, each time series is first transformed into a series of information granules with trend following the principle of justifiable granularity. The formed granular time series can well capture the main features lying in the original time series and help realize dimensionality reduction. Then, the wFCM method is developed to complete time-series clustering in the granular space. Here, the dynamic time warping (DTW) is extended to capture the similarity for trend-based granular time series. Furthermore, the weighted DTW barycenter averaging is introduced to derive prototypes presented in a granular format, capturing the level, the fluctuation, and the changing trend, which are meaningful and understandable clustering results. The experiments conducted on real-world datasets coming from the UCR time-series database and Chinese stocks are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the designed time-series clustering model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d236f240970773d538ca8e","63d236f240970773d538ca8f","63d236f240970773d538ca90","63d236f240970773d538ca91","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fec","mniswId":"7967","title":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","issn":"2168-2267","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c0bf8f9d-14c5-4757-a7dd-adaa18c03c9e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d0093c4097075010fd1dfd","year":"2022","documentHash":"ae9ea4c2-fbab-4145-8ab5-c575e99c751b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Dynamic time warping (DTW)","granular prototype","time series","trend-based information granulation (TIG)","weighted fuzzy clustering"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654753154"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"632d766b4097073ab8826aee","name":"Cezary Radosław","lastName":"Lipinski","documentHash":"84e9f10e-b428-404d-bef5-102764aab2aa"},{"objectId":"632d766b4097073ab8826aed","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Biernacki","documentHash":"da82266c-6c87-47ed-b358-f5472e7ed1c9"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde28","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Szelągowski","uuid":"27F74A4788BFD3CE18AFEB15DDFD6AF68BFD26DF42B08C891FC5799E5B821C30B1F9540493266D7BECFDE07FFF614A4D3046CB12C2036C95DBF88BD8E077B779","orcidId":"0000-0002-5114-6793","documentHash":"e3659fe9-4b80-4538-b542-c25ae66f4639"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Berniak-Woźny","uuid":"6138BF6B0A41DA74BFC258AA49BE7E5394626426404BA3AC8D242813245830AFA5AACE0908A279A3C7F928737C7621C8210C452F3DFC7AD46842090E2364BA3B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3156-5755","documentHash":"95feafe5-9ec4-4ca4-8cd3-ceb6bdadc6bf"}],"objectId":"632d766b4097073ab8826aeb","doi":"10.1108/bpmj-11-2021-0743","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/BPMJ-11-2021-0743/full/html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Proposal of BPMN extension with a view to effective modeling of clinical pathways","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose\nThe aim of the article is to propose BPMN extensions that facilitate the modeling of Clinical Pathways in a way that enables for various groups of users, the transfer of a much wider range of information in the form of process models without compromising their readability and usefulness.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe paper uses the design science research methodology (DSRM) and covers phases of a design-oriented research project extending BPMN notation for clinical pathway modeling.\nFindings\nThe article proposes extensions of BPMN in 5 areas, enabling standardization of the description of business processes of different natures and complexity and in turn meeting the needs and requirements of modeling clinical pathways and, more broadly speaking, knowledge-intensive business processes (kiBPs) in general.

Defined extensions to the BPMN specification makes it possible to standardise the description of processes of different natures and levels of complexity.

The authors applied a methodological approach based on a theoretical literature review and a review of practice through online structured expert interviews with key BPMS solution providers. According to the literature, the main drivers pertain to the enterprises’ efforts to reduce costs and improve their productivity and efficiency, develop technology, and enact changes in business models and business processes. According to vendors, the main drivers for the combination of BPMS and Case Management Systems (CMS) were the users’ expectations, technology identity, and further development perspectives. The main limiters of the decision to combine both classes of systems were technological problems predicted by vendors related to the unification of historically different technologies used in both classes of systems, as well as implementation-based problems related to the likely need to reconfigure the software environments of software users. The article formulated original recommendations for both vendors and users of iBPMS software, including the basic recommendation of the selection of the methodology of implementation of BPM and iBPMS in accordance with the context of the organization’s operations (the nature of its business processes)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"399-420","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","632d6ed04097073ab88142d4","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780c6","mniswId":"8300","title":"Informatica","issn":"0868-4952","eissn":"1822-8844","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"11caa9f7-abd9-4e7a-ad01-9eba21d77914"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632d6ed04097073ab88142d3","year":"2022","volume":"33","number":"2","documentHash":"7ec50968-52f2-48c4-b664-2ca148c9d17f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Business Process Management Systems (BPMS)","Case Management Systems (CMS)","systems merger","merger drivers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654753242"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d00c924097075010fd321c","name":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Loia","documentHash":"3ef2072f-52ef-4d40-b3f6-abf7c7debd4b"},{"objectId":"63d00c924097075010fd321b","name":"Stefania","lastName":"Tomasiello","documentHash":"02585c97-de20-4f91-a607-ec7709029168"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"63d00c924097075010fd3219","doi":"10.1109/tfuzz.2022.3157947","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9732219","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"On Fractional Tikhonov Regularization: Application to the Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System for Regression Problems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this article, we introduce a variant of the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).

This results in a simpler rule base, with a low number of rules, allowing to handle problems with many input variables with relatively low computational time while keeping high accuracy. We present new theoretical results on the fractional Tikhonov regularization. Such results are the basis for a formal discussion on how much the choice of a different architecture, resulting in a different matrix in the least-squares minimization, could affect the accuracy. We perform several numerical experiments on benchmark examples, first to assess the impact of the fractional regularization on the accuracy and then to compare our results against the most recent ones reported in the literature by other ANFIS-like or neuro-fuzzy systems.

However, the works on estimating oscillation bounds of output values with regard to varying limits of input, are lacking. In this study, we investigate the oscillation-bound estimation of perturbations for BKS. First, the BKS output variation scopes are acquired for interval perturbation, where the R -implication, ( S,N )-implication, QL-implication, and t -norm implication are adopted. Second, in allusion to the more sophisticated problem of the fuzzy reasoning chain with BKS, the oscillation bounds of BKS output resulting from input interval perturbation are offered. Third, we construct the upper and lower bounds of BKS output deviation originated in the simple perturbation of the input fuzzy set, in which the situations of one rule and multiple rules are both dissected. Finally, the stable properties of all these BKS strategies are confirmed. It is emphasized that interval perturbation and simple perturbation are more general ways to give expression describing the robustness issue, and the obtained oscillation bounds also deliver more detailed characterization of the output deviation along with the input perturbation. This study further validates the sound properties of the BKS method."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"52","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"6269-6282","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d25ec840970773d53c1ed8","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fec","mniswId":"7967","title":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","issn":"2168-2267","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c0bf8f9d-14c5-4757-a7dd-adaa18c03c9e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d25ec840970773d53c1ed7","year":"2022","volume":"52","number":"7","documentHash":"29ef3bc3-ab34-4892-9e5f-c66e4fda9cf7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bandler–Kohout subproduct (BKS)","compositional rule of inference (CRI)","fuzzy reasoning","perturbation","robustness","stability"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654753379"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d1346a40970711f8fd2f97","name":"Zunwei","lastName":"Fu","documentHash":"2f3fe1b6-d9a2-414c-8ba1-7c4bb41f5e7d"},{"objectId":"63d1346a40970711f8fd2f96","name":"Sung-Kwun","lastName":"Oh","documentHash":"bd4a923e-5e62-4ad7-abe6-d0003c907d96"},{"objectId":"63d1346a40970711f8fd2f95","name":"Seok-Beom","lastName":"Roh","documentHash":"1bdde9d5-07c2-45e3-80a0-aefce954aa0e"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"63d1346a40970711f8fd2f93","doi":"10.1109/tnnls.2020.3041947","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9298923","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Dynamically Generated Hierarchical Neural Networks Designed With the Aid of Multiple Support Vector Regressors and PNN Architecture With Probabilistic Selection","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The two issues on dynamically generated hierarchical neural networks such as the sort of basic neurons and how to compose a layer are considered in this article. On the first issue, a variant version of the least-square support vector regression (SVR) is chosen as a basic neuron. Support vector machine (SVM) is a representative classifier which usually shows good classification performance. Along with the SVMs, SVR was introduced to deal with the regression problem. Especially, least-square SVR has the advantages of high learning speed due to the substitution of the inequality constraints by the equality constraint in the formulation of the optimization problem. Based on the least-square SVR, the multiple least-square (MLS) SVR, which is a type of a linear combination of least-square SVRs with fuzzy clustering, is proposed to improve the modeling performance. In addition, a hierarchical neural network, where the MLS SVR is utilized as the generic node instead of the conventional polynomial, is developed. The key issues of hierarchical neural networks, which are generated dynamically layer by layer, are discussed on how to retain the diversity of the nodes located at the same layer according to the increase of the layer. In order to maintain the diversity of the nodes, various selection methods such as truncation selection and roulette wheel selection (RWS) to choose the nodes among candidate nodes are proposed. In addition, in order to reduce the computational overhead to determine all candidates which exhibit all compositions of the input variables, a new implementation method is proposed. From the viewpoint of the diversity of the selected nodes and the computational aspects, it is shown that the proposed method is preferred over the conventional design methodology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1385-1399","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d1346a40970711f8fd2f95","63d1346a40970711f8fd2f96","5e70922b878c28a047391011","63d1346a40970711f8fd2f97"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547800c","mniswId":"8002","title":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","issn":"2162-237X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"8f46c096-72fa-4032-aec0-8c4388a3c47f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d1346a40970711f8fd2f94","year":"2022","volume":"33","number":"4","documentHash":"aca2831a-bbb1-48ce-9f68-4604f25d964c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hierarchical neural networks","least-square support vector regression (SVR)","multiple SVR","polynomial neural networks (PNNs)","roulette wheel selection (RWS)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654753444"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63cfdb264097075010f9bcc5","name":"Oleg H.","lastName":"Huseynov","documentHash":"4967a28e-d88a-470d-a6fc-d14e5be04f24"},{"objectId":"63cfdb264097075010f9bcc4","name":"Babek G.","lastName":"Guirimov","documentHash":"b93f7e47-558c-43ac-86fa-b94a33753f3e"},{"objectId":"63cfdb264097075010f9bcc3","name":"Rafik A.","lastName":"Aliev","documentHash":"08566751-d705-4cb8-9a0d-4f7d1c1949c9"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"63cfdb264097075010f9bcc1","doi":"10.1109/tfuzz.2020.3037969","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9258938","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Acquisition of Z-Number-Valued Clusters by Using a New Compound Function","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A large number of clustering methods exist including deterministic, probabilistic, and fuzzy clustering.

The main finding from this work is that inclusion of expert knowledge leads to more robust and accurate predictive models. Considering the limited size of data from air pollution monitoring stations, additional expert knowledge enabled to select most meaningful explanatory variables, and as the consequence the statistical inference lead to the improved predictions.

The problem is commonly known as catastrophic forgetting, a significant challenge in continual learning (CL). To overcome the catastrophic forgetting, regularization-based CL methods construct a regularization-based term, which can be considered as the approximation loss function of previous tasks, to penalize the update of parameters. However, the rigorous theoretical analysis of regularization-based methods is limited. Therefore, we theoretically analyze the forgetting and the convergence properties of regularization-based methods. The theoretical results demonstrate that the upper bound of the forgetting has a relationship with the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix. Hence, to decrease the upper bound of the forgetting, we propose eiGenvalues ExplorAtion Regularization-based (GEAR) method, which explores the geometric properties of the approximation loss of prior tasks regarding the maximum eigenvalue.

The IFSs attract much attention and find many applications though, obviously, there are still some conceptual and algorithmic open problems related to their use. One of such problems is the ranking of intuitionistic fuzzy alternatives. The problem is very important but not all known methods produce satisfactory results. In this paper, we recall and critically analyze several methods of ranking of the intuitionistic fuzzy alternatives. We analyze them from the point of view of the results they yield and compare them taking into account their very illustrative geometrical representations. It turns out that most of these methods, except for one, have similar geometrical representations. For this latter method, we augment the assumptions assumed in the original version with an additional assumption, a justified and natural one, though not explicitly included so far. We therefore obtain a clearer interpretation of formulas involved in the augmented version of the method since the arguments pro, against and the hesitation are explicitly accounted for. This transparency is relevant for the user because there is no intuitively appealing linear order among the intuitionistic fuzzy alternatives so that some additional assumptions are to be made while ranking the elements. These issues are dealt with, and examples are provided."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii

All these constructs are aimed at the formalization and processing data at a certain level of abstraction. Along the same line, in the recent years, we have seen intensive developments in fuzzy clustering, which are not surprising in light of a growing impact of clustering on fundamentals of fuzzy sets (as supporting ways to elicit membership functions) as well as algorithms (in which clustering and clusters form an integral functional component of various fuzzy models). In this study, we investigate order-2 information granules (fuzzy sets) by analyzing their formal description and properties to cope with structural and hierarchically organized concepts emerging from data. The design of order-2 information granules on a basis of available experimental evidence is discussed and a way of expressing similarity (resemblance) of two order-2 information granules by engaging semantically oriented distance is discussed. In the sequel, the study reported here delivers highly original contributions in the realm of order-2 clustering algorithms. Formally, the clustering problem under discussion is posed as follows: given is a finite collection of reference information granules. Determine a structure in data defined over the space of such granules. Conceptually, this makes a radical shift in comparison with data defined in the p-dimensional space of real numbers R $^{p}$ . In this situation, expressing distance between two data deserves prudent treatment so that such distance properly captures the semantics and consequently, the closeness between any two information granules to be determined in cluster formation. Following the proposal of the semantically guided distance (and its ensuing design process), we develop an order-2 variant of the fuzzy C-means (FCM), discuss its detailed algorithmic steps, and deliver interpretation of the obtained clustering results. Several relevant applied scenarios of order-2 FCM are identified for spatially and temporally distributed data, which deliver interesting motivating arguments and underline the practical relevance of this category of clustering. Experimental studies are provided to further elicit the performance of the clustering method and discuss essential ways of interpreting results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"53","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"5414-5423","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fec","mniswId":"7967","title":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","issn":"2168-2267","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c0bf8f9d-14c5-4757-a7dd-adaa18c03c9e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64e5d4bb409707485e780e67","year":"2023","volume":"53","number":"9","doi":"","documentHash":"78072a85-d98b-4eb4-8842-8f027c45f0b6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["clustering","interpretation","multiview clustering","order-2 fuzzy sets","reference information granules","semantics-oriented distance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654786158"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63cfb4b64097075010f295c5","name":"Wenyi","lastName":"Zeng","documentHash":"b75e32e2-78b5-49ef-ab91-eed1260d474b"},{"objectId":"63cfb4b64097075010f295c4","name":"Yuming","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"845fbb2d-d0d2-4b6e-960a-47a4a1948575"},{"objectId":"63cfb4b64097075010f295c3","name":"Fusheng","lastName":"Yu","documentHash":"47b4b581-45ce-4b80-bbc6-fdc9ea6433ae"},{"objectId":"63cfb4b64097075010f295c2","name":"Yuqing","lastName":"Tang","documentHash":"805c6190-83a5-40d3-b101-cbd08a14dcb6"},{"objectId":"63cfb4b64097075010f295c1","name":"Fang","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"61a199ba-a32d-4781-95c3-cdb5824f1e86"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"63cfb4b64097075010f295bf","doi":"10.1109/tfuzz.2021.3113762","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9540982","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Multilinear-Trend Fuzzy Information Granule-Based Short-Term Forecasting for Time Series","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Although the idea of information granulation has been shown to be a research craze in short-term time series forecasting, it is still urgent to develop a granular framework so that information granulation can characterize the trend distribution of data to the significant extent under a common concept of time. This article puts forward a novel granulation algorithm involving two-stage partitioning scheme so that information granule established there exhibits well-articulated semantics at the time level, while at the same time, it gives full consideration to the varying patterns of data. On this basis, a new association rule based on this type of information granules is presented. Unlike most fuzzy association rules, the proposed association rules can extract and derive the correlations between two collections of trend features corresponding to the past and future, which is in accord with human's reasoning. Keeping in mind that the prediction process should center on essential rules while freeing from the interference of irrelevant rules, which contributes to a reliable prediction result, thus, a rule selection algorithm is involved so as one makes sure the accuracy and interpretability of the forecasting results. The design of short-term forecasting model based on fuzzy inference system is implemented, where the concept of granulation eliminates the commonly used alternative, i.e., the recursive iterations of one-step prediction.

To overcome these shortcomings, in this article, we build trend fuzzy granulation-based long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to carry out long-term forecasting, where data points with consistent trend characteristics, including trend change, fluctuation range, and trend persistence, are predicted in unison rather than individually. Noticing that these trend characteristics are more urgently needed than just magnitude information, a question on how to granulate a time series into a granular time series consists of meaningful granules containing trend information that comes to be a crucial step. Only if the established granules fit the varying patterns of time series at utmost, such a granulation can make sense for the improvement of the forecasting accuracy; thus, an optimization method of trend-oriented fuzzy granulation is proposed to meliorate the granulation results. With the built trend fuzzy granulation-based LSTM networks, the successive iterations of one-step forecasting are prevented, and the prediction errors of data within a granule will not further increase. This is the first attempt to build trend fuzzy granule-based LSTM to predict the trend characteristics.

Although they can quantitatively depict the overlapping areas with a partition matrix, their performances deteriorate when dealing with high-dimensional data because the distance computations may be negatively impacted by the irrelevant features, and then the concentration effect may arise. Moreover, they are sensitive to noisy environments. To tackle these obstacles, a robust jointly sparse fuzzy clustering method (RJSFC) is proposed in this study. The representative prototypes, sparse membership grades, and an orthogonal projection matrix are simultaneously learnt when optimizing RJSFC. The obtained low-dimensional embeddings can preserve the local neighborhood structure, and the clustering is conducted in the transformed lower dimensional space rather than the original space, which improves the capability of fuzzy clustering for dealing with high-dimensional scenarios. Furthermore, L2,1 -norm is exploited as the basic metric for both loss and regularization parts in RJSFC, the robustness of the model and the interpretability of the extracted features are enhanced. The notions of fuzzy clustering, neighborhood structure preservation, and feature extraction are seamlessly integrated into a unified model. The limitation of the previous two-stage clustering framework when dealing with high-dimensional data entailing dimensionality reduction and clustering procedures separately can be effectively addressed. Extensive experimental results on various well-known datasets demonstrate the usefulness of RJSFC when comparing with some state-of-the-art methods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1073-1087","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d79a0e4097074c74269aa5","5e70922b878c28a047391011","63d79a0e4097074c74269aa6","63d79a0e4097074c74269aa7","63d79a0e4097074c74269aa8","63d79a0e4097074c74269aa9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ff6","mniswId":"7978","title":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issn":"1063-6706","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2707d48e-bd2d-4094-8688-dbcf61c20fb1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d79a0e4097074c74269aa4","year":"2022","volume":"30","number":"4","documentHash":"8b3131ad-d431-43e5-8378-9f4febc8a08b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Feature extraction","fuzzy clustering","jointly sparse","neighborhood structure preservation","space projection"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654786428"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"63d137dd40970711f8fdc586","doi":"10.1109/tfuzz.2021.3105193","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9516933","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Federated FCM: Clustering Under Privacy Requirements","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Federated learning addresses the issue of machine learning realized under constraints of privacy and security. While there have been intensive studies on building and analyzing federated regression models, this topic has not been analyzed so far in the area of fuzzy systems. To narrow down this gap, in this study, we formulate and solve a problem of unsupervised federated learning by designing an original federated FCM (F-FCM) clustering which could serve as a basis toward building a spectrum of fuzzy set constructs including rule-based models. Following a general client–server structure, where the local data residing with each client are not available globally and cannot be centralized (as commonly encountered in learning scenarios), the aim is to discover an overall structure across all data. The federated gradient-based optimization realized in the horizontal mode is developed. An overall learning process is derived, which is composed of communicating gradients coming from clients and providing updates of the prototypes at the server side and passing them on to the clients. It is also shown that the relevance of the globally constructed structure is conveniently assessed in terms of granular footprints of the prototypes constructed by the F-FCM. Some illustrative examples are covered to illustrate the efficiency of the developed federated algorithm."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"3384-3388","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ff6","mniswId":"7978","title":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issn":"1063-6706","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2707d48e-bd2d-4094-8688-dbcf61c20fb1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63cfb4b64097075010f295c0","year":"2022","volume":"30","number":"8","documentHash":"52d5de85-7c80-44e5-b1fb-7f9a3f6a443c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Client","distributed data","fuzzy clustering","federated learning","gradient learning","granular footprint","horizontal model of learning","privacy and security","server"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654786432"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64c0f54d409707196b345426","name":"Eduardo","lastName":"Garro","documentHash":"39e828e3-e6e1-4443-b855-10cfadec4dd5"},{"objectId":"64c0f54d409707196b345425","name":"Lambis","lastName":"Tassakos","documentHash":"63eb676a-2d86-4523-beee-33cb435c9391"},{"objectId":"634f612b752340623bbe664e","name":"Anastasiya","lastName":"Danilenka","uuid":"069BE6142859027D635B6D4659E69E4F97F3C961DD5B87FDED9F98E9307CDD9F19333C0C15092F0DA79435A123FE874101E36420C532023150CCC705E637953B","documentHash":"c7cb1f84-39c0-4ee6-ab3b-dbda9aa235f9"},{"objectId":"633f8f297523402e340fee5f","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Bogacka","uuid":"14DBEB0291614AADEEF3FF8DF0AE88BE045B3145519C4FE43D4C02831D5BF047432485EED7B2608E0A74F850BC4F2576474D938FD0BB1DFD8E10F9913CEB11F2","documentHash":"0e7589c4-9740-498a-aba4-51ca2994ec13"},{"objectId":"5e709460878c28a0473bbbb2","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wasielewska-Michniewska","uuid":"7AC38E766400919F5105968D58CBEACEC4CA05765138568D6854E0AC9D6E612DBC361D82892AC468833F6AAC7F34A0FA87AFF8EBFC6DC459D2C51E5CE37E9333","documentHash":"650618eb-edb9-4d99-bd37-453b9670bf3f"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394e98","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Paprzycki","uuid":"5B7C90E72D40497375F5BA78D1C4DB9BB79A6D4D7BB177AD034994CA885AAF6ED7617D5EF01EEBCCF0178890D10A52D5AC35FE1F7603165AE8C861AE672BCCD5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8069-2152","documentHash":"3f20fd48-b1cd-4c97-952f-84211d07be00"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a04739297b","name":"Maria","lastName":"Ganzha","uuid":"FE26E0DC9CD7FD1F79C4A997D7DC8891B9C0EE91BFE7ED751B9AB870736888AA93D8E9937A2CD6224547116A9D8C7FEB856D1DF950682C0D3DEC77E6B271B193","orcidId":"0000-0001-7714-4844","documentHash":"e6181dd5-2e2f-4441-b7d3-6ba79a91c547"}],"objectId":"64c0f541409707196b3453ff","doi":"10.1109/wf-iot54382.2022.10152142","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10152142","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Introducing Federated Learning into Internet of Things ecosystems – preliminary considerations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Federated learning (FL) was proposed to train models in distributed environments.

The random parameters of the systems are subject to a two-layer stochastic process and the underlying stochastic process is assumed to be subject to a semi-Markov process. Furthermore, a novel switched Lyapunov function is used, which may be monotonically increasing or decreasing at the instant of nonmodal switching.

Achieving accurate and dynamic prediction of carbon consumption in this process is of evident significance to protect the environment and raise the economic efficiency of iron and steel industry. This article develops an original dynamic modeling framework, including automatic identification of operating conditions, modeling in different conditions, and dynamic prediction model of sintering carbon consumption. First, an automatic kernel-based fuzzy C-means algorithm is presented for the automatic identification of operating conditions. Dynamic relationships between the inputs and output of the model are analyzed by copula entropy, and then, the relevant production data in each operating condition are determined by a just-in-time learning method. Next, broad learning models are established under different operating conditions. Furthermore, a dynamic prediction model of sintering carbon consumption is designed, and the prediction error is adopted to quantify the performance of the model and as one criterion to determine the update of production database. Finally, results of experiments using actual production data demonstrate the advantage and validity of the developed model compared with some advanced modeling methods. The developed model considers complex characteristics of the sintering process and presents better dynamic performance and information mining performance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"71","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"3133-3141","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b78afe4097073a07588c50","65b78afe4097073a07588c51","65b78afe4097073a07588c52","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ffb","mniswId":"7983","title":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issn":"0278-0046","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"75463c36-77e9-41e6-8888-73d50b6ff5e1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b78afe4097073a07588c4f","year":"2024","volume":"71","number":"3","documentHash":"f3c37c07-e2d9-47d6-a217-2e96453ed04f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Actual production data","automatic kernel-based fuzzy C-means (AKFCM) algorithm","broad learning model (BLM)","carbon consumption prediction","sintering process (SP)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654790152"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63dcef6040970768a2c05356","name":"Fuyuan","lastName":"Xiao","documentHash":"54b919af-cf7a-4569-83cb-142522d446da"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"63dcef6040970768a2c05354","doi":"10.1109/tpami.2022.3167045","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9756979","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Negation of the Quantum Mass Function for Multisource Quantum Information Fusion With its Application to Pattern Classification","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In artificial intelligence systems, a question on how to express the uncertainty in knowledge remains an open issue. The negation scheme provides a new perspective to solve this issue. In this paper, we study quantum decisions from the negation perspective. Specifically, complex evidence theory (CET) is considered to be effective to express and handle uncertain information in a complex plane. Therefore, we first express CET in the quantum framework of Hilbert space. On this basis, a generalized negation method is proposed for quantum basic belief assignment (QBBA), called QBBA negation. In addition, a QBBA entropy is revisited to study the QBBA negation process to reveal the variation tendency of negation iteration. Meanwhile, the properties of the QBBA negation function are analyzed and discussed along with special cases. Then, several multisource quantum information fusion (MSQIF) algorithms are designed to support decision making. Finally, these MSQIF algorithms are applied in pattern classification to demonstrate their effectiveness. This is the first work to design MSQIF algorithms to support quantum decision making from a new perspective of “negation”, which provides promising solutions to knowledge representation, uncertainty measure, and fusion of quantum information."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"45","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"2054-2070","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63dcef6040970768a2c05356","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478010","mniswId":"8006","title":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","issn":"0162-8828","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"71ac5882-8621-4b73-9614-0c17a445e9e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63dcef6040970768a2c05355","year":"2023","volume":"45","number":"2","documentHash":"d140463e-ae8e-4bf7-b37f-6555b2638051"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["complex evidence theory","quantum decision","quantum basic belief assignment","quantum negation","quantum entropy","multisource quantum information fusion","uncertainty","pattern classification"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654790197"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"65bce54f40970779568cedf5","doi":"10.1109/tfuzz.2022.3204416","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9878201","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Granular Data Compression and Representation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We develop a comprehensive and original methodology of data compression realized in the setting of granular computing.

Then knowledge-driven and data-driven fuzzy clustering methods come into being. To address the challenges of inadequate extraction mechanism and imperfect fusion mode in such class of methods, we propose the Knowledge-induced Multiple Kernel Fuzzy Clustering (KMKFC) algorithm. First, to extract knowledge points better, the Relative Density-based Knowledge Extraction (RDKE) method is proposed to extract high-density knowledge points close to cluster centers of real data structure, and provide initialized cluster centers. Moreover, the multiple kernel mechanism is introduced to improve the adaptability of clustering algorithm and map data to high-dimensional space, so as to better discover the differences between the data and obtain superior clustering results. Second, knowledge points generated by RDKE are integrated into KMKFC through a knowledge-influence matrix to guide the iterative process of KMKFC. Third, we also provide a strategy of automatically obtaining knowledge points, and thus propose the RDKE with Automatic knowledge acquisition (RDKE-A) method and the corresponding KMKFC-A algorithm. Then we prove the convergence of KMKFC and KMKFC-A.

In terms of coding, a new fuzzy C-means coding (FCMC) method is proposed, which breaks the limitation of uniformly distributed receptive fields of existing coding methods and automatically determines suitable receptive fields that reflect the density distribution of the input data for encoding through the fuzzy C-means clustering. In terms of spike response function, triangular fuzzy numbers instead of the commonly used alpha-type function are used as the spike response function. Different from other functions of fixed shape, width parameters of the proposed function are learnt in the iterative way like weights of synapses do.

Existing urban distribution modes mostly depend on trucks. This paper proposes a novel package pickup and delivery mode and system wherein multiple drones collaborate with automatic devices. The proposed mode uses free areas on top of residential buildings to set automatic devices as delivery and pickup points of packages, and employs drones to transport packages between buildings and depots. The integrated scheduling problem of package drop-pickup considering m -drones, m -depots, and m -customers is crucial for the system. Therefore, we propose a simulated-annealing-based two-phase optimization (SATO) approach to solve this problem. In the first phase, tasks are allocated to depots for serving, such that the initial problem is decomposed into multiple single-depot scheduling problems with m -drone. In the second phase, considering the drone capability and task demand constraints, we generated a route-planning scheme for drones in each depot. Concurrently, an improved variable neighborhood descent (IVND) algorithm was designed in the first phase to reallocate tasks, and a local search (LS) algorithm was proposed to search for high-quality solutions in the second phase. Finally, extensive experiments and comparative studies were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"9175-9190","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65c4bf1a4097075e5f15dc3e","65c4bf1a4097075e5f15dc3f","65c4bf1a4097075e5f15dc40","65c4bf1a4097075e5f15dc41","65c4bf1a4097075e5f15dc42","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478002","mniswId":"7989","title":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","issn":"1524-9050","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4c1c29ee-ee5e-439c-90b9-c7835ecd1651"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c4b3554097075e5f150f91","year":"2023","volume":"24","number":"9","documentHash":"0826a467-7879-44aa-9375-e79725011e78"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Last-mile distribution","drop-pickup","drone","two-phase optimization approach","SATO-IVND"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654802938"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65cf9bbd4097075ea847aaf9","name":"Josep","lastName":"Batle","documentHash":"0bc36cfe-9a53-418c-8f0a-7cf1f6088a52"},{"objectId":"65cf9bbd4097075ea847aaf7","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Białecki","documentHash":"a9e586fb-51d3-4f61-b4b2-f7307cee0440"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7cef","name":"Adam","lastName":"Bednorz","uuid":"6A396DB9945482AE040D2C122C90EB4AB9A6F54B1DBE0E85EA0E6B345A6EBD0AECB80835641E3BB5E92841058CE1F7C788B68142AECB1FB81E02F10339154098","orcidId":"0000-0001-6329-2328","documentHash":"696182bc-7ba8-4ea5-bf66-9912b421fd04"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0ec6","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Rybotycki","uuid":"897C50FD08D1E1C7E1D847E52E6B17284720DE16A905746C4FC31F35D1B1A20C8A6687DCBB6B343C4180F783FE2135C4D836F4938A191BE1C5CD6963ACDB5441","orcidId":"0000-0003-2493-0459","documentHash":"409ac0d1-bcc9-40c6-ad2f-00edeeea1141"}],"objectId":"65cf9bbd4097075ea847aaf5","doi":"10.1103/physreva.109.l020201","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.109.L020201","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Quantum dimension witness with a single repeated operation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present a simple null test of a dimension of a quantum system, using a single repeated operation in the method of delays, assuming that each instance is identical and independent.

The objective of this article is to develop a concept and provide a design framework as well as assess its performance for constructing a collection of rule-based models on a basis of a randomly sampled repository of data and then realize their aggregation. More specifically, for the sampled data, the design of each model is carried out in a standard way as commonly encountered in the case of Takagi–Sugeno (TS) rule-based models and next augmented by gradient boosting. The aggregation is realized by optimizing a weighting scheme applied to the results of the individual models. Our intent is also to carefully demonstrate the performance offered by the mechanisms of machine learning applied in the setting of rule-based models, which is an original task completed before. A number of high-dimensional data are used in the experimental studies to complete a thorough assessment. A comparative performance analysis is reported with respect to the monolithically developed TS models."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"31","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"2479-2486","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65c4cc8a4097075e5f1797e8","65c4cc8a4097075e5f1797e9","5e70922b878c28a047391011","65c4cc8a4097075e5f1797ea"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ff6","mniswId":"7978","title":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issn":"1063-6706","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2707d48e-bd2d-4094-8688-dbcf61c20fb1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c4cc8a4097075e5f1797e7","year":"2023","volume":"31","number":"7","documentHash":"e47b2eb1-98e4-4ff7-8469-c1938d1fbefe"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Aggregation","curse of dimensionality","data dimensionality","distributed rule-based model","gradient boosting"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654803118"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65c4cffb4097075e5f17d57e","name":"Kaoru","lastName":"Hirota","documentHash":"640d2a7f-f06c-4056-96ff-23075dd540ad"},{"objectId":"65c4cffb4097075e5f17d57d","name":"Min","lastName":"Wu","documentHash":"6a916ba7-3732-4ea7-b662-db869ab1a2c3"},{"objectId":"65c4cffb4097075e5f17d57c","name":"Min","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"e301a557-ad40-4fd5-a58d-4222e74ca78f"},{"objectId":"65c4cffb4097075e5f17d57b","name":"Luefeng","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"75400016-5b8c-4c5f-b8b6-4e5c190ffbc1"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"65c4cffb4097075e5f17d57a","doi":"10.1109/tnnls.2023.3236320","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10024142","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Coupled Multimodal Emotional Feature Analysis Based on Broad-Deep Fusion Networks in Human–Robot Interaction","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A coupled multimodal emotional feature analysis (CMEFA) method based on broad–deep fusion networks, which divide multimodal emotion recognition into two layers, is proposed. First, facial emotional features and gesture emotional features are extracted using the broad and deep learning fusion network (BDFN). Considering that the bi-modal emotion is not completely independent of each other, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is used to analyze and extract the correlation between the emotion features, and a coupling network is established for emotion recognition of the extracted bi-modal features. Both simulation and application experiments are completed. According to the simulation experiments completed on the bimodal face and body gesture database (FABO), the recognition rate of the proposed method has increased by 1.15% compared to that of the support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVMRFE) (without considering the unbalanced contribution of features). Moreover, by using the proposed method, the multimodal recognition rate is 21.22%, 2.65%, 1.61%, 1.54%, and 0.20% higher than those of the fuzzy deep neural network with sparse autoencoder (FDNNSA), ResNet-101 + GFK, C3D + MCB + DBN, the hierarchical classification fusion strategy (HCFS), and cross-channel convolutional neural network (CCCNN), respectively.

This is extremely important from the perspective of eliminating the existing broadening gap between the considerations of academic researchers and the needs of business itself.\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nA systematic literature review was conducted on the basis of the resources of two digital databases: Web of Science (WoS) and SCOPUS. Based on the PRISMA protocol, the authors selected 29 papers published in the last decade that diagnosed the challenges and limitations of modern BPM and contained recommendations for its future development. The content of the articles was analyzed within four BPM core areas.\nFindings\n\nThe authors of the selected articles most commonly point to the areas of organization (21 articles) and methods and information technology (IT) (22 articles) in the context of the challenges and limitations of current BPM and the directions of recommended future BPM development. This points to the prevalence among researchers of the perspective of Industry 4.0 – or focus on technological solutions and raising process efficiency, with the full exclusion or only the partial signalization of the influence of implementing new technologies on the stakeholders and in particular – employees, their roles and competencies – the key aspects of Industry 5.0.\nResearch limitations/implications\n\nThe proposal of BPM future development directions requires the extension of the BPM paradigm, taking into account its holistic nature, especially unpredictable, knowledge-intensive business processes requiring dynamic management, the need to integrate BPM with knowledge management (KM) and the requirements of Industry 5.0 in terms of organizational culture. The limitation is that the study is based on only two databases: WoS and SCOPUS and that the search has been narrowed down to publications in English only.\nPractical implications\n\nThe proposal of BPM future development directions also requires the extension of the BPM paradigm, taking into account the specific challenges and limitations that managers encounter on a daily basis. The presented summaries of the challenges and limitations resulting from the literature review are accompanied by recommendations that are primarily dedicated to practitioners.\nSocial implications\n\nThe article indicates the area people and culture as one of the four core areas of BPM.

However, they are susceptible to unilateral revocations by the vendor making them a risky proposition for long-running applications with strict performance requirements. It is challenging to effectively balance the cost savings that transient resources provide with the associated revocation risk which, if realised, can impact application performance. To address this challenge, we propose an approach for risk-aware cloud cost optimization that is inspired by the concept of portfolio diversification . Contract diversification mitigates the revocation risk by procuring the required compute capacity as a mixed portfolio of transient and non-transient resources. Resource diversification further diversifies the risk by using multiple transient resource types. Using our approach, consumers can leverage contract and resource diversification to proactively (re-)configure their application's resource portfolio to handle workload and resource price fluctuations while minimizing ongoing cost and keeping ongoing revocation risk within tolerable limits. Simulative evaluation using three real-world workload traces and Amazon's EC2 offerings demonstrate that our proposed approach can achieve meaningful cost savings compared to the baseline costs, while significantly reducing the portfolio's exposure to revocation risk."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709434878c28a0473b824f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"3014-3026","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["652931a640970767695ff757","652931a640970767695ff758","652931a640970767695ff759","652931a640970767695ff75a","5e709434878c28a0473b824f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478019","mniswId":"8015","title":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","issn":"1939-1374","eissn":"1939-1374","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"9c6ad4e1-a0c4-46dd-9a95-3776eba0afcb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"652931a640970767695ff756","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"4","documentHash":"e6bfda53-8cc9-425a-a7f1-c61940b74d7a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Amazon EC2","cost-optimization","diversification","risk-adjusted returns","risk-aware","transient resources"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654877808"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"652cf846409707703df75f83","name":"Hongtao","lastName":"Ren","documentHash":"5d873d8e-8ba5-4b5b-942a-c98221e1369c"},{"objectId":"652cf846409707703df75f82","name":"Bingqing","lastName":"Ding","documentHash":"c97c3b2b-b42a-4fdc-8724-1ae3c361e6d2"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0946","name":"Marek","lastName":"Makowski","uuid":"6124BA71FD42D934638D3F4F7E43E06A3398CF92609518BA61E13F66AE11E14560CCB1D905E9B1D012BF8087F12100D351B69EDE50936109281940E9C457403D","documentHash":"cb49a74b-5f3c-49d7-abb4-ea1cbae7895c"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a04739100e","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Nahorski","uuid":"1EF2B08D468D1EF6CA5ABE8126DCD17798EB839E7274A8A4BC24B463FB0BE117628EDF6056801D65239486B31E9BDA80234841E215F38754E9F3EB67B689D6C0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2340-8020","documentHash":"9de9252a-2092-4211-92b7-73f2c543d376"}],"objectId":"652cf846409707703df75f80","doi":"10.1109/is57118.2022.10019642","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10019642","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Handling parameter uncertainty in long-term technology-mix planning models","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The raw material prices are key parameters of long-term technology-mix planning models. Some of such prices, in particular of the crude oil, dramatically change in periods much shorter than the planning horizon. Therefore, approaches based on price prediction methods or on price scenarios are unsuitable for planning the technology-mix because changing an implemented mix is usually impracticable; thus the mix can hardly be adapted to changing prices.The paper proposes a novel approach to handling uncertain model parameters, motivated by planning technologies for production of liquid fuels in China that is nowadays based mainly on imported crude oil. The method augments the earlier developed model by finding such a fixed crude-oil price that minimizes regret caused by inevitable difference between the assumed fixed price and actually diverse prices during operations of the planned technology mix.The paper outlines the adopted technology planning model, defines the regret function, and illustrates its use by simple examples. Thanks to the modular structure of the proposed approach, it is rather easy to experiment with diverse regret functions as well as different technology-mix models."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c5878c28a0473b0946","5e70922b878c28a04739100e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157417b3","mniswId":"661","fullName":"IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Systems","shortName":"IEEE IS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"e88f34db-c7ff-4df4-9eb7-e5b13c09d7ee"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"63d978e64097073994992d80","startDate":"2022-10-12","endDate":"2022-10-14","fullName":"IEEE 11th International Conference on Intelligent Systems","shortName":"IS’22","city":"Warsaw","country":"PL","website":"http://ieee-is-2022.ibspan.waw.pl/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"f70eebed-d68c-4380-a7cb-8bde2c5100af"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a04739100e","5e7093c5878c28a0473b0946","652cf846409707703df75f82","652cf846409707703df75f83"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"63d9799b40970739949930fe","doi":"10.1109/is57118.2022","title":"2022 IEEE 11th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS)","year":2022,"isbn":"978-1-6654-5656-2","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10019601/proceeding","translation":false,"documentHash":"d8d15e50-6159-4a38-a0c2-09cce810f244"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Technology-mix model","uncertain oil prices","regret function","long-term capacity planning","liquid fuel production"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654892699"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a0878c28a0473c0a3f","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Bykuć","uuid":"AC7DC186480FFC75AF6058177C4B27F1EEA7BBEE7103B01CABA795BBB24F11916A8DFE561A87AD60422DF31B79C6E84EDCDBC89976F16AA51FA3BEBEA60E6A48","orcidId":"0000-0001-8192-5432","documentHash":"7cdec7da-6cfc-4e13-bd87-5f7b1e01fb9f"},{"objectId":"5e709460878c28a0473bbb37","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kaczmarek-Majer","uuid":"0087CB6164DB0E85F06F1E33A2F188BD3B4D4B8B535FBDFD1B35F1237A1063F10FC364FE3B1DB1E69F4D42AE88BEBAA8DA8D9BFEBE15113835244D62D71574C8","documentHash":"506043a3-b093-402e-b5cf-5d2037ba7f11"},{"objectId":"5e709287878c28a04739746d","name":"Joerg","lastName":"Verstraete","uuid":"29AD362756C373ED073B919257FE21512D8FA54FBA4035B6C938C55E5284CA1882ED37A6F5D66F9E21B570D4D2CEC95EA88E97B5B0557541E4BFE60B609F8161","documentHash":"5c456f03-3557-411c-bdd0-790ae934931d"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396d6a","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Radziszewska","uuid":"8E5B3D4F2229E091232F7FDB796D799204A62276E271D3FFBF18EE580CDFE3667814568EDA0E755D1038A5320161E62E7B3A80CEF66A383CA2A6B3424117E9E4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2958-5156","documentHash":"892b1ec9-c68f-461a-8141-e59b466b482b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"66eaf1bafdbe836650b22463","doi":"10.1109/tfuzz.2024.3367008","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439613","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Combined Defuzzification Under Shared Constraint","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Defuzzification of fuzzy sets is an important aspect of fuzzy processing, as it determines how the fuzziness is dealt with when performing the final step to obtain crisp solutions. In this contribution, we consider the possibility of defuzzifying multiple general type-1 fuzzy sets, given that their defuzzified values are bound by a single, known constraint. This stems from an application in spatial data processing, where we obtained a number of fuzzy sets whose defuzzified values should sum up to a crisp and known value. It is possible to defuzzify each fuzzy set individually and rescale the outcomes to meet the constraint. However, considering that the fuzzy set contains information on what constitutes good values, accounting for the constraint in the defuzzification process has the potential to yield better results.

The authors present the current knowledge on the challenges faced by business process management in the era of hyperautomation, especially from the perspective of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). They discuss theoretical aspects and, in the form of two case studies, present how hyperautomation reduces traditional business processes to tasks performed mainly automatically and increases the importance of dynamic business processes (BPs), which are difficult to copy as a source of competitive advantages. This is especially important in the case of SMEs, which usually do not use their size (effect of scale) as a competitive advantage, but rather, their knowledge, speed of adaptation, or flexibility of action."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","uid":"bLDwoyIU1jG5BHqZ9HzVPQg","uuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Zarządzania z siedzibą w Rzeszowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","parentUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","rootUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"384-400","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dfce","mniswId":"23383","title":"International Journal of Process Management and Benchmarking","issn":"1460-6739","eissn":"1741-816X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"41442e6e-3d26-445c-99c4-950ecc0ea42a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6557428b4097077c67904350","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"3","documentHash":"24b41e75-3848-462d-8d73-9688a0bebad4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Business Process Management (BPM)","business process nature","Industry 4.0","Hyperautomation","Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)","illustrative case study"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654903287"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e32","name":"Aleksy","lastName":"Barski","uuid":"914AE85E6B6F876D628C71E4374D86EB480AB638C38B64DB19A51DA83296013A73BE3EAB202401FB9A3A05D9FDC1BB60E71971C16310AD9C0CB7DE602EAECB26","documentHash":"34752bea-f16d-4781-9407-9afc1cc7d666"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391019","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Stańczak","uuid":"DA2B04A9DEC64395130272C3DE2B80F85A2940C452594AFDB480492A5B3E4F8D1A58F6708DF7B10EF64F6A3D1D82695AE237AB745157B67F4F5800DB22D00508","documentHash":"d0b01401-93a3-4bc2-a194-85c321378a7e"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391015","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Sęp","uuid":"8B2510D597EC946B909B5E83F59DD065DFF280C8B754E6B4F3D292445F4F1F7F3C1F9C2419184A39F72B59904A47E7E558D33E8819800F300258CDE8D71E22C2","documentHash":"6e88c516-34b7-43cc-b1ee-681d0b49413b"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391010","name":"Jan","lastName":"Owsiński","uuid":"416042265B06410CDDA6F2A0342AF1B0372F802B33CCC88EB6873B5E8CE78AFB1F9CCAA7D953998E4EB364B2E5BA21FE72EE64265D7AA153D6CD0EE725F588B4","documentHash":"e6f64468-5cbe-471d-b233-d312af71f8f3"},{"objectId":"5e70920f878c28a04738f539","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Mażbic-Kulma","uuid":"65B0F6ED54ACAD17CA99A12FBF0FB90E32447634B7FAA5320C84923D8C6DF3A092F314FAE45B8F5F89C4BE595F491D7F52722B8E20646F05C47E7185639052CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-7668-4694","documentHash":"572e840e-0a6f-4ebe-9c38-e552d1855793"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"6582b78040970751d8ee8846","doi":"10.15439/2023f9176","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.15439/2023f9176","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Evolutionary k-means Graph Clustering Method to Obtain the hub&spoke Structure for Warsaw Communication System","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The k-means method is one of the most frequently used clustering methods due to its efficiency and ease of modification. This paper presents its modification used for clustering in graphs. The method is presented on the example of generating the hub\\&spoke structure in the graph of public transport connections in Warsaw. Optimization of the public transport is one of the most important task for large cities. An efficient transport system is very important for its inhabitants. One of possible solutions is introducing the idea of hub \\& spoke to communication system. In this approach is important to detect main stations, called hubs, which will create axes of high-speed connections (city trains, metro, high-speed trams), from which passengers will transfer to slower local connections to get to their rather close destinations. In the presented approach we propose to find locations of such main changeover stations using an evolutionary k-means algorithm."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709273878c28a047395e32","5e70922b878c28a047391019","5e70922b878c28a047391015","5e70922b878c28a047391010"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"289-294","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"61b9ae66ad204581b62ebbd8","mniswId":"2222","fullName":"CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS","shortName":"FedCSIS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"8eb81c65-25da-4c93-b8c5-29c2918b99a5"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"650be39d40970743d238ef44","startDate":"2023-09-17","endDate":"2023-09-20","fullName":"18th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems","shortName":"FedCSIS 2023","city":"Warsaw","country":"PL","website":"https://2023.fedcsis.org/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"9e6f935e-55b8-44f8-866c-29f7064cf73f"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a047391019","5e70922b878c28a047391010","5e70920f878c28a04738f539","5e709273878c28a047395e32","5e70922b878c28a047391015"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"652e50ea40970777572f5026","doi":"10.15439/978-83-969601-3-9","title":"Communication Papers of the 18th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems","year":2023,"volume":"37","isbn":"978-83-969601-3-9","url":"https://annals-csis.org/proceedings/2023/pliks/communication.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"5fe51c18-6f55-46b9-86b7-460e65c11ae5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hub&spoke","evolutionary k-means algorithm","city transport system"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654907027"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66a06729ece39868043da593","name":"Meizhi ","lastName":"Qian","uuid":"62012B322AE559DBBFD5C957FFC639ABEC29CACAAD7A208804A38419255168A6BD0B898469A61F99E4F8F9B46E6EE8B2D575E61DC050E9ACE212BCEBECB58B20","documentHash":"c5443086-3de8-4794-a7e2-ef17844fe612"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a047397664","name":"Nikolai","lastName":"Osmolovskii","uuid":"3E3C5815A3EE42C9EED71511289BEE7FD5BCA6BCA228CE433F71927A761FDCA7BEEB621BBA5323424B8C3E27B7BA047F0A51769ACF2A959B76047A138022005B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3111-3908","documentHash":"e2d3b5ae-848a-4061-be0d-938585bda134"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396dab","name":"Jan","lastName":"Sokołowski","uuid":"D86F76C962EA4F52C42EC0E2867AFE870286266A7B8FACAAA324F869A573E8589798B0DD2700B73686277707B16BBD81D2D84C00FEE9C0AA49AAB989F7376D7A","documentHash":"8831a331-385f-4d75-bf78-45626a80b1b0"}],"objectId":"672dd99afdbe835022282980","doi":"10.1109/mmar62187.2024.10680812","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680812","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Control and optimum design for networks with nonlinear state equations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Optimal control problem for semilinear hyperbolic equations is considered on 3 -star metric graph.

The domain of definition for the distributed parameter system is given by a graph G. The optimal cost function for control problem is further optimized with respect to the shape and topology of the graph Ω. The small cycle is introduced and the topological derivative of the cost with respect to the size of the cycle is determined. In this way, the singular perturbations of the graph can be analyzed in order to change the topology Ω. The topological derivative method in shape and topology optimization is a new tool which can be used to minimize the shape functionals under the Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) constraints. The topological derivative is used as well for solution of optimum design problems for graphs. In optimal control problems the topological derivative is used for optimum design of the domain of integration of the state equation. As an example, optimal control problems are considered on a cross with a small cycle. The state equation is the wave equation on the graph. The boundary control problem by Neumann conditions at a boundary vertex is solved for a tracking cost function. The shape functional is given by the optimal value of the control cost. The topological derivative of the shape functional is determined for the steady state model with the size of a cycle ε → 0.

The model is a Neumann wave-type equation with low regularity coupling conditions given in terms of a nonlinear von Karman plate. This problem is motivated by the elimination of aeroelastic instability (sustained oscillations of bridges, airfoils, etc.) in engineering applications. Empirical observations indicate that the subsonic wave-plate system converges to equilibria. Classical approaches which decouple the plate and wave dynamics have fallen short. Here, we operate on the model as it appears in the engineering literature with no regularization and achieve stabilization by microlocalizing the Neumann boundary data for the wave equation (given through the plate dynamics). We observe a compensation by the plate dynamics precisely where the regularity of the 3D Neumann wave is compromised (in the characteristic sector)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927d878c28a0473968d6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"505-545","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65a7b1584097071e0b8907b4","5e70927d878c28a0473968d6","65a7b1584097071e0b8907b5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478db9","mniswId":"14031","title":"Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences","issn":"0218-2025","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"ded5ce68-8153-430b-9da3-7c6d8e74db06"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a7b1584097071e0b8907b3","year":"2023","volume":"33","number":"3","documentHash":"875c0e1d-cad6-464d-b434-3f6d43046b74"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fluid–structure interaction","nonlinear plate","hyperbolic regularity","Neumann-to-Dirichlet map","aeroelasticity","feedback stabilization","microlocal analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654913699"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65ad1de84097072172c06faf","name":"Jinde","lastName":"Cao","documentHash":"c41a97c9-3a3e-4a73-9d50-1e13a5057b9a"},{"objectId":"65ad1de84097072172c06fae","name":"Hao","lastName":"Shen","documentHash":"bc2e7d37-5754-43de-8438-93e2dc1b965b"},{"objectId":"65ad1de84097072172c06fad","name":"Zongjie","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"22645790-06e5-4dbe-9638-175f49725ecc"},{"objectId":"65ad1de84097072172c06fac","name":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"df27344b-3cec-4d19-bcf3-1740e64447bb"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e75e","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"A56F3A8C2F6246587B88982FE48FEA2855A7B5222539A126265F1D882510368FD87B8932975E7451D01686982B7D3158DA885EF3F5FFA39E4B9D9EE6FD22470F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6960-9525","documentHash":"715a0529-c457-4823-a66d-ee6bebb7dd83"}],"objectId":"65ad1de84097072172c06faa","doi":"10.1109/tfuzz.2023.3284609","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10147345","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Fuzzy H∞ Control of Semi-Markov Jump Singularly Perturbed Nonlinear Systems With Partial Information and Actuator Saturation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article focuses on the fuzzy H∞ control problem for a class of semi-Markov jump singularly perturbed nonlinear systems with actuator saturation.

To alleviate these problems, we devise an independent object-level decomposing and enhancing generative adversarial networks, denoted as InDecGAN, to synthesize complex images and capture varied objects in a complex scene. Specifically, InDecGAN fully utilizes the independent object-level information, bounding boxes and high-resolution images of objects in training, by employing independent object-level pathways to synthesize varied objects. The independent object-level pathway integrates an independent object-level adversarial loss and the bounding box information to learn the visual features of objects independently, then, the main pathway exploits the features provided by the object-level pathway to compose the full scene and synthesize images. In addition, we analyze the generalization properties of the proposed InDecGAN and demonstrate the improvement from the perspective of the model architecture. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on a widely used dataset are presented to demonstrate that the proposed model with an independent object-level pathway produces synthesized images of significantly improved quality."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"8279-8293","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65ac06f1409707191d2b322b","65ac06f1409707191d2b322c","65ac06f1409707191d2b322d","65ac06f1409707191d2b322e","5e709200878c28a04738e75e","65ac06f1409707191d2b322f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478009","mniswId":"7996","title":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","issn":"1520-9210","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"74b523fa-51a2-4367-b612-9587b1b84d99"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ac06f1409707191d2b322a","year":"2023","volume":"25","documentHash":"a12eaa12-249d-4493-8f9d-845015f12b00"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Complex scene","independent object-level pathway","size information","text-to-image synthesis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654917442"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b912a14097073f660ba7b2","name":"ZhiWu","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"35659879-38bb-4852-b490-3e88f7782a77"},{"objectId":"65b912a14097073f660ba7b1","name":"Giancarlo","lastName":"Succi","documentHash":"07ea22a4-bae7-401b-a517-7b349844f9cb"},{"objectId":"65b912a14097073f660ba7b0","name":"XiuBin","lastName":"Zhu","documentHash":"8157fa17-9445-463e-85f6-c2c3b5fea121"},{"objectId":"65b912a14097073f660ba7af","name":"TaiLong","lastName":"Jing","documentHash":"05bb6b18-4c6f-437a-b322-a30c65f88773"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"65b912a14097073f660ba7ad","doi":"10.1109/tetci.2023.3265391","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10114455","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Linguistic Models: Optimization With the Use of Conditional Fuzzy C-Means","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Most fuzzy models are just numeric. In this study, we revisit, explore and augment a concept of linguistic models, viz., fuzzy models producing results that are information granules, and, specifically, intervals or fuzzy sets. The proposed architecture is formed by constructing a network of linked fuzzy sets (information granules) ininput and output spaces with the aid of a context-based Fuzzy C-Means clustering method. The user centricity of such clustering method is implied by the explicit formulation of fuzzy sets in the output space. The resulting information granules constructed in the input space are conditioned by the corresponding fuzzy sets in the output space. This arrangement can increase the interpretability of the model and represent the model as a collection of logically arranged associations among information granules. The model's overall design process is discussed along with a detailed algorithmic structure. Its experimental evaluations are provided by using both synthetic and publicly datasets. For the former, the model brings the performance improvement ranging from 91% to 250% over the models with information granules uniformly distributed in output space. For the latter, such improvement ranges from 6% to 94%.

However, they still suffer when coping with faces under large poses and heavy occlusions for inaccurate facial shape constraints and insufficient labeled training samples. In this article, we propose a semisupervised framework, that is, a self-calibrated pose attention network (SCPAN) to achieve more robust and precise facial landmark detection in challenging scenarios. To be specific, a boundary-aware landmark intensity (BALI) field is proposed to model more effective facial shape constraints by fusing boundary and landmark intensity field information. Moreover, a self-calibrated pose attention (SCPA) model is designed to provide a self-learned objective function that enforces intermediate supervision without label information by introducing a self-calibrated mechanism and a pose attention mask. We show that by integrating the BALI fields and SCPA model into a novel SCPAN, more facial prior knowledge can be learned and the detection accuracy and robustness of our method for faces with large poses and heavy occlusions have been improved. The experimental results obtained for challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the literature."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"53","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"3546-3560","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b787884097073a07583e59","65b787884097073a07583e5a","65b787884097073a07583e5b","65b787884097073a07583e5c","5e70922b878c28a047391011","65b787884097073a07583e5d","65b787884097073a07583e5e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fec","mniswId":"7967","title":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","issn":"2168-2267","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c0bf8f9d-14c5-4757-a7dd-adaa18c03c9e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b787884097073a07583e58","year":"2023","volume":"53","number":"6","documentHash":"e44e268e-7498-4af0-95a7-86ffa8b818a3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Facial landmark detection","heatmap regression","heavy occlusions","self-calibrated mechanism","shape constraints"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654920966"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65bcb490409707795688fc67","name":"Liehuang","lastName":"Zhu","documentHash":"5cb38513-a8cb-437d-9d03-b04cdf217ce8"},{"objectId":"65bcb490409707795688fc66","name":"Sung-Kwun","lastName":"Oh","documentHash":"90fe6833-f38e-4b22-8728-3affdd6d8972"},{"objectId":"65bcb490409707795688fc65","name":"Yueyue","lastName":"Xiao","documentHash":"838e2f5d-9a1a-48f2-83ff-109ddd864067"},{"objectId":"65bcb490409707795688fc64","name":"Wei","lastName":"Huang","documentHash":"66ef7be4-f8d8-41d3-96dd-fc5b972abca9"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"65bcb490409707795688fc63","doi":"10.1109/tnnls.2023.3288577","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172227","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Random Polynomial Neural Networks: Analysis and Design","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this article, we propose the concept of random polynomial neural networks (RPNNs) realized based on the architecture of polynomial neural networks (PNNs) with random polynomial neurons (RPNs). RPNs exhibit generalized polynomial neurons (PNs) based on random forest (RF) architecture. In the design of RPNs, the target variables are no longer directly used in conventional decision trees, and the polynomial of these target variables is exploited here to determine the average prediction. Unlike the conventional performance index used in the selection of PNs, the correlation coefficient is adopted here to select the RPNs of each layer. When compared with the conventional PNs used in PNNs, the proposed RPNs exhibit the following advantages: first, RPNs are insensitive to outliers; second, RPNs can obtain the importance of each input variable after training; third, RPNs can alleviate the overfitting problem with the use of an RF structure. The overall nonlinearity of a complex system is captured by means of PNNs. Moreover, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is exploited to optimize the parameters when constructing RPNNs. The RPNNs take advantage of both RF and PNNs: it exhibits high accuracy based on ensemble learning used in the RF and is beneficial to describe high-order nonlinear relations between input and output variables stemming from PNNs. Experimental results based on a series of well-known modeling benchmarks illustrate that the proposed RPNNs outperform other state-of-the-art models reported in the literature."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"35","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"15589-15599","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65bcb490409707795688fc64","65bcb490409707795688fc65","65bcb490409707795688fc66","5e70922b878c28a047391011","65bcb490409707795688fc67"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547800c","mniswId":"8002","title":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","issn":"2162-237X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"8f46c096-72fa-4032-aec0-8c4388a3c47f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67765bd1fdbe833e69509b07","year":"2024","volume":"35","number":"11","doi":"","documentHash":"20f11843-9670-46fa-b8e1-b7cddc7ce698"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","polynomial neural networks (PNNs)","random polynomial neural networks (RPNNs)","random polynomial neurons (RPNs)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654920992"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b9176d4097073f660c4eb5","name":"Xin","lastName":"Su","documentHash":"7e107bbb-838f-4c4b-adda-8fffe3d5eeff"},{"objectId":"65b9176d4097073f660c4eb4","name":"Di","lastName":"Zhao","documentHash":"017167e2-4e3c-4d33-b614-b936915f443f"},{"objectId":"65b9176d4097073f660c4eb3","name":"Xinyuan","lastName":"Ji","documentHash":"bb34c7c1-925f-45c2-bc11-244b53fadec3"},{"objectId":"65b9176d4097073f660c4eb2","name":"Hongyan","lastName":"Xing","documentHash":"7f1f66dc-4cf6-493f-bc3c-b2155cd3445c"},{"objectId":"65b9176d4097073f660c4eb1","name":"Xu","lastName":"Yang","documentHash":"ca38dae2-50f3-4052-bb77-1487cc98ef7d"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"65b9176d4097073f660c4eb0","doi":"10.1109/jsen.2023.3291397","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10177907","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Multifeature Fusion-Based Thunderstorm Prediction System With Switchable Patterns","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Atmospheric electric field signal (AEFS) features can be characterized by their average value (AV), standard deviation (SD), and entropy value (EV). How to mine and fully utilize AEFS features to ensure reliable and efficient thunderstorm detection has not been considered so far. In this article, based on the stacked autoencoder (SAE) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model, extracted deep-seated features of AEFS are used to obtain its predicted value (PV). It fuses three regular features plus one PV feature and proposes a thunderstorm moving path (TMP) prediction system with switchable patterns among the applied three AEFS prediction models based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). This fully considers that a single model is difficult to meet AEFS predictions with different weather attributes. Specifically, AEF data measured by a self-made AEF apparatus are adopted to determine feature values (FVs). According to FV intervals (FVIs) in sunny and thunderstorm weathers, the proportion of each feature satisfying FVIs is taken as the weighting factors of corresponding feature terms. A switchable pattern function with different switching conditions is formed by combining weightings and feature variables. Optimal AEFS prediction models are fixed under the same switching condition and applied to corresponding patterns. Empirical results confirm that the proposed system effectively predicts TMPs, with an average determination coefficient of 95.58%. This is the first study to design switchable patterns to detect thunderstorms from a new perspective of multiple AEFS feature fusion, which provides promising solutions to the refinement and intelligent prediction of thunderstorms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"16","pagesFromTo":"18461-18476","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b9176d4097073f660c4eb1","65b9176d4097073f660c4eb2","65b9176d4097073f660c4eb3","65b9176d4097073f660c4eb4","65b9176d4097073f660c4eb5","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fd0","mniswId":"7933","title":"IEEE Sensors Journal","issn":"1530-437X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"3b9ba5c4-ee9a-4ada-9f3c-718ff7f26faf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64dc5e104097071887053e6d","year":"2023","volume":"23","number":"16","documentHash":"2d025dfd-36bf-4452-bdb3-1149a846307a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Atmospheric electric field (AEF)","feature","prediction","thunderstorm"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654921085"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b7910a4097073a075974f3","name":"Kwok-Wai","lastName":"Hung","documentHash":"3fdb1087-d654-446f-9e2b-7da7a369891b"},{"objectId":"65b7910a4097073a075974f2","name":"Yudong","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"d1f2cf0e-256c-45ea-8f34-6747a8c2d19f"},{"objectId":"65b7910a4097073a075974f1","name":"Jie","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"734f2fb2-32f5-41ff-aa5a-5c511bb601d5"},{"objectId":"65b7910a4097073a075974f0","name":"Jianglin","lastName":"Lu","documentHash":"178627d5-0374-4819-b00e-2282bad4e904"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"65b7910a4097073a075974ee","doi":"10.1109/tcyb.2022.3232787","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10015100","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Asymmetric Transfer Hashing With Adaptive Bipartite Graph Learning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Thanks to the efficient retrieval speed and low storage consumption, learning to hash has been widely used in visual retrieval tasks. However, the known hashing methods assume that the query and retrieval samples lie in homogeneous feature space within the same domain. As a result, they cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous cross-domain retrieval. In this article, we propose a generalized image transfer retrieval (GITR) problem, which encounters two crucial bottlenecks: 1) the query and retrieval samples may come from different domains, leading to an inevitable domain distribution gap and 2) the features of the two domains may be heterogeneous or misaligned, bringing up an additional feature gap. To address the GITR problem, we propose an asymmetric transfer hashing (ATH) framework with its unsupervised/semisupervised/supervised realizations. Specifically, ATH characterizes the domain distribution gap by the discrepancy between two asymmetric hash functions, and minimizes the feature gap with the help of a novel adaptive bipartite graph constructed on cross-domain data. By jointly optimizing asymmetric hash functions and the bipartite graph, not only can knowledge transfer be achieved but information loss caused by feature alignment can also be avoided. Meanwhile, to alleviate negative transfer, the intrinsic geometrical structure of single-domain data is preserved by involving a domain affinity graph. Extensive experiments on both single-domain and cross-domain benchmarks under different GITR subtasks indicate the superiority of our ATH method in comparison with the state-of-the-art hashing methods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"54","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"533-545","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b7910a4097073a075974f0","65b7910a4097073a075974f1","65b7910a4097073a075974f2","5e70922b878c28a047391011","65b7910a4097073a075974f3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fec","mniswId":"7967","title":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","issn":"2168-2267","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c0bf8f9d-14c5-4757-a7dd-adaa18c03c9e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b7910a4097073a075974ef","year":"2024","volume":"54","number":"1","documentHash":"112af5e9-1f64-4e90-a2e2-c5e16527e00c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Adaptive bipartite graph","asymmetric hashing","learning to hash","transfer learning (TL)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654921135"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b90d934097073f660b55e7","name":"Yong","lastName":"Deng","documentHash":"444b9907-1656-4caf-95ed-6f5ea180c54a"},{"objectId":"65b90d934097073f660b55e6","name":"Yingying","lastName":"Liang","documentHash":"77df64fd-b917-4e86-8183-b68ef1184158"},{"objectId":"65b90d934097073f660b55e5","name":"Qianli","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"23b19e56-172d-4348-b51d-802e6ade0b33"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"65b90d934097073f660b55e4","doi":"10.1109/tfuzz.2023.3284713","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10147362","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Information Granule Based Uncertainty Measure of Fuzzy Evidential Distribution","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Quantifying the uncertainty of information distributions containing randomness, imprecision, and fuzziness is the premise of processing them.

Such a structure is composed of parallel substructures arranged in series and is considered operable if at least one component in each substructure is operable. The components are assumed to have different failure probabilities, so the system reliability depends on where they are located in the structure. The optimal allocation minimizes the system failure probability or, alternatively, maximizes its reliability. Interestingly enough, while the optimal components allocation problem for a parallel-series structure (i.e. series substructures arranged in parallel) has a well-known simple solution, the same does not hold for a series-parallel one. The considered problem has been investigated by several researchers who proposed quite elaborate solutions. This paper presents a recently developed, simple and efficient procedure finding a nearly optimal allocation, and sometimes the optimal one. The presented approach is based on a theorem specifying a threshold value that cannot be exceeded by a series-parallel system's reliability. Starting from some random allocation and using pairwise interchanges of components between the parallel substructures, the algorithm finds successive allocations that yield system reliabilities oscillating towards the value specified by the above theorem. In this way a suboptimal (or, many a time, optimal) allocation is obtained. An important feature is that the method's accuracy is expressed by the easy-to-compute upper bound of the difference between the optimal reliability and the obtained suboptimal value. The performed tests show that the method allows to find a (sub)optimal solution in a relatively small number of steps. Illustrative examples are given that demonstrate the method's modus operandi."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a04739100c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1151-1157","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"6594016140970739462e2dce","fullName":"European Safety and Reliability  Conference","shortName":"ESREL","website":"https://www.esrel2023.com/","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"854472a7-3066-4cb8-a446-1ba072f0957c"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"6594033640970739462e3e88","startDate":"2023-09-03","endDate":"2023-09-07","fullName":"33rd European Safety and Reliability Conference","shortName":"ESREL 2023","city":"Southampton","country":"GB","website":"https://www.esrel2023.com/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"6175b194-3166-4b41-9058-0707304a1b13"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a04739100c"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"6594071440970739462e8916","title":"Proceedings of the  The 33rd European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL 2023)","year":2023,"isbn":"978-981-18-8072-8","url":"https://rpsonline.com.sg/proceedings/esrel2023/html/toc.html","translation":false,"documentHash":"6535b043-c529-46cd-bbdb-a5eda75020ae"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Series-parallel structure","Reliability","Components independence","Pairwise interchange","Optimal/suboptimal components allocation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654926131"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659fd6a040970707a12d92d1","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Wojna","documentHash":"ba2caf6b-1019-404a-a9ba-07ed39d1a569"},{"objectId":"659fd6a040970707a12d92d0","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Góra","documentHash":"432bb346-bbd9-4ed0-8963-9376e1b76044"},{"objectId":"5e709352878c28a0473a7475","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Skowron","uuid":"5F1926B596FC713500F3E6B7D9075D38399B5A8382DDA7CD65F7F176BEE2523B3D39BADA38F6A62E5C00027AFA887B23F2F8DC823D59FC8F6BD0A565B1833A9C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5271-6559","documentHash":"feedcacc-b75a-4e42-9ceb-fc9cef69a6f5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"659fd6a040970707a12d92cf","doi":"10.15439/2023f4139","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.15439/2023f4139","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Explainability in RIONA Algorithm Combining Rule Induction and Instance-Based Learning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article concerns the well-known RIONA algorithm.

It should be noted that the RIONA algorithm requires analysing only a small number of objects and rules contrary to algorithms based on the generation of huge sets of rules."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709352878c28a0473a7475"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"491-502","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"61b9ae66ad204581b62ebbd8","mniswId":"2222","fullName":"CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS","shortName":"FedCSIS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"8eb81c65-25da-4c93-b8c5-29c2918b99a5"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"6508017a40970775139dc641","startDate":"2023-09-17","endDate":"2023-09-20","fullName":"18th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems","shortName":"FedCSIS 2023","city":"Warszawa","country":"PL","website":"https://fedcsis.org/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"32a85a0f-b7f7-43d7-b1f3-e35405e20f3d"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659fd6a040970707a12d92d0","5e709352878c28a0473a7475","659fd6a040970707a12d92d1"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"650825234097077513a026eb","title":"Proceedings of the 18th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems: September 17–20, 2023.

More specifically, they are generally two classes of vertex-colored and edge-labeled graphs rendering a walking agent therein to determine his initial and current positions, respectively, in probability one by measuring the color sequence of his traversed vertices. In the part of analysis, we follow the aforementioned two definitions and establish the corresponding polynomial-time verifying algorithms. Notably, the implicit formulas are also established to calculate the observability and detectability probability for any pairwise vertex pair. In the synthesis part, the minimal number of colors dyeing the vertices to make the considered graph stochastically observable and detectable is investigated, respectively. Our results indicate that the minimal coloring problem is NP-hard for observability in the stochastic situations but is solvable in polynomial time for detectability in the deterministic cases. The observability and detectability of stochastic finite-valued systems, assembling with the finite-cardinal state spaces, are validated as a compelling application of these two types of directed graphs, whereas the minimal sensors placement problems subject to observability and detectability problems are accordingly interpreted by the minimum set cover algorithm."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"7299-7311","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65ac00f6409707191d2b05ce","65ac00f6409707191d2b05cf","65ac00f6409707191d2b05d0","5e709200878c28a04738e75e","65ac00f6409707191d2b05d1","65ac00f6409707191d2b05d2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fdc","mniswId":"7945","title":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","issn":"0018-9286","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"843bf367-f25f-404d-99f4-e60c3c038ff6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ac00f6409707191d2b05cd","year":"2023","volume":"68","number":"12","documentHash":"54cdda48-afb2-4753-b635-53ccb41dd37b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Colored graphs","detectability","discrete-time and discrete-state dynamic systems","minimal sensors placement problem","NP-hardness","observability"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654930073"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65bcd69140970779568bb410","name":"Xiaocheng","lastName":"Song","documentHash":"f4dce163-b91d-4028-98df-5f3f9639b168"},{"objectId":"65bcd69140970779568bb40f","name":"Fuji","lastName":"Ren","documentHash":"5848dff8-f9e1-4abe-aa65-908696f546a1"},{"objectId":"65bcd69140970779568bb40e","name":"Zhifu","lastName":"Pan","documentHash":"56967ce1-a3d3-4a29-b5e0-a3ae085b9329"},{"objectId":"65bcd69140970779568bb40d","name":"Yiming","lastName":"Tang","documentHash":"0d10b659-2df6-4a7a-a449-26649bd4b2c0"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"65bcd69140970779568bb40b","doi":"10.1109/tetci.2022.3201620","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9875204","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Viewpoint-Based Kernel Fuzzy Clustering With Weight Information Granules","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Domain knowledge can be introduced into fuzzy clustering with the aid of information granules, embodied by the concept of viewpoints. For such kind of fuzzy clustering methods, the strategy of acquisition of viewpoints has not been fully developed. Furthermore a way of determining the related information granules deserves more attention. Having these problems in mind, in this study, the density Viewpoint-based Weighted Kernel Fuzzy Clustering (VWKFC) algorithm is proposed. First, the kernel-based hypersphere density initialization (KHDI) algorithm is presented as a certain prerequisite, in which the kernel distance is utilized instead of the Euclidean distance. Besides, a novel density radius is put forward. Second, the concept of the weight information granule is established, which incorporates two parts. The feature weight matrix is provided, where different weights are assigned to different features to reduce the influence of unrelated features. Meanwhile a sample weight is assigned to each data point, thus the influence of noise and outliers on clustering can be reduced to a certain extent. Third, the data point with the highest local density obtained by KHDI is regarded as the density viewpoint. Then we combine kernel mechanism, density viewpoints, weight information granules and a maximum entropy regularization to design the VWKFC algorithm, and prove its convergence. Experimental results validate that VWKFC is superior over eight related clustering algorithms with regard to five evaluation indexes, especially when processing high-dimensional data. It has been shown that VWKFC makes the selection of initialized cluster centers and viewpoints more reasonable, and obtains better clustering results, and achieves higher convergence speed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"342-356","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65bcd69140970779568bb40d","65bcd69140970779568bb40e","5e70922b878c28a047391011","65bcd69140970779568bb40f","65bcd69140970779568bb410"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f4f4","mniswId":"28880","title":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence","eissn":"2471-285X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"1c75830f-85db-4a32-b2dc-7a510185c039"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65bcd69140970779568bb40c","year":"2023","volume":"7","number":"2","documentHash":"0b3cc8a9-4bb3-4f61-9d2c-506ead7e2abd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Feature weighting","fuzzy c-means","fuzzy clustering","granular computing","information granules"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654933282"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b8e3544097073f66fd23f9","name":"Badong","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"a5fb8493-d383-4133-88c5-b64918d2c50b"},{"objectId":"65b8e3544097073f66fd23f8","name":"Yuanpeng","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"2ecf305d-100a-4074-9659-edd0ad78e9be"},{"objectId":"65b8e3544097073f66fd23f7","name":"Nan","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"cd90e392-a5aa-44d2-9fba-cb37a8ee922f"},{"objectId":"65b8e3544097073f66fd23f6","name":"Kup-Sze","lastName":"Choi","documentHash":"c248cdd4-67fd-4740-b7d2-d6f7f446d37f"},{"objectId":"65b8e3544097073f66fd23f5","name":"Xiuyu","lastName":"Huang","documentHash":"2ae132b8-527e-4fa0-80ea-9f99430d914f"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"65b8e3544097073f66fd23f3","doi":"10.1109/tcds.2023.3279262","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10132039","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Shallow Inception Domain Adaptation Network for EEG-based Motor Imagery Classification","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Electroencephalography (EEG) data across multiple individuals have a high variance. Directly using the data to train a deep learning model usually degrades the performance. To address this issue, we propose a shallow Inception domain adaptation framework to extract informative deep features from data of multiple subjects for accurate motor imagery (MI) recognition. To our best knowledge, the Inception architecture in deep learning is combined with domain adaptation (DA) scheme for the first time for the MI classification task. The approach contains two compact Inception blocks that decode temporal features in different scales. In addition, we jointly optimize a novel combined loss function to reduce both marginal and class conditional discrepancies caused by the multi-modal structure of EEG signals. The DA-based loss enables Inception blocks to take full advantage of their learning abilities to capture discriminative patterns of MI data from multiple subjects instead of relying on the target user only. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct substantial experiments on two wellknown datasets, BCI competition IV-2a and IV-2b. Results show that our model achieves better performance than state-of-theart strategies.

To this end, automatic consensus reaching approaches have been developed to improve effectiveness and efficiency. However, in the existing automatic consensus reaching approaches, preference adjustment willingness (PAW) is overlooked and consistency/consensus thresholds cannot be guaranteed to be reached, which may lead to an unacceptable collective decision. This study proposes a new automatic consensus reaching approach with PAW for GDM. First, under the paradigm of interval information granularity, PAW is formally defined by considering both the amount and sensitivity of preference adjustment. Levels of interval information granularity are adaptively determined by an algorithm with achievement of the consistency threshold. Then, we propose an automatic preference adjustment model where the weighted average of PAW, group consensus, and individual consistency is defined as its performance index. Based on the proposed model and algorithm, a consensus evolution realizing a continuous improvement of consensus is subsequently developed. Finally, the framework of the proposed approach is presented. The applicability of the proposed approach was analyzed through a case study concerning the concept selection of a turbofan engine's component. Discussions on parameter settings and time-consuming of the approach show its great effectiveness and time efficiency. Comparison with other similar approaches demonstrates that the proposed approach is able to achieve larger consistency and consensus improvement with a smaller preference adjustment amount."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"31","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"3331-3345","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b8f5de4097073f66010929","65b8f5de4097073f6601092a","65b8f5de4097073f6601092b","65b8f5de4097073f6601092c","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ff6","mniswId":"7978","title":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issn":"1063-6706","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2707d48e-bd2d-4094-8688-dbcf61c20fb1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b8f5de4097073f66010928","year":"2023","volume":"31","number":"10","documentHash":"2f4d01a8-dc1f-4b9d-a879-d8929d3ccb12"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Consensus reaching approach","group decision-making (GDM)","information granularity","preference adjustment willingness (PAW)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654933296"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65bcae864097077956886909","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Koniarski","documentHash":"6a86d4a3-625f-4b53-b65a-fa2d671356d7"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b56","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Myśliński","uuid":"9C83A6F063FE2F720C598B9D6282690E1CA207C9AB0E4641DA3BDE6AFF4B49ABECFA96140FFED392345738558E0A1A081106E89DDBCB02EEC141F95294EAA7A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0909-3114","documentHash":"267fab46-c039-4419-9a82-95284b2ada39"}],"objectId":"65bcae864097077956886908","doi":"10.1109/icecet58911.2023.10389555","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10389555","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Image Registration for Virtual Drone Flight Simulation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the past decade, drones have expanded their applications, such as surveying, search and rescue, and last-mile delivery. Drone autonomy is a growing focus in these areas, requiring test environments for both drone operators and autonomous algorithms. This work addresses the creation of a realistic test environment for accurate position perception, motion planning, and drone control. Our approach uses RGB-D sensors and image registration techniques to construct a 3D map of the real environment, enabling drone navigation simulation. We adapt the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, incorporating feature point filtering and local optical flow to expedite 3D point processing, particularly in static scenes. A challenge in the standard ICP algorithm is selecting suitable initial points for effective matching between consecutive point clouds. Our modified approach tackles this issue, optimizing the algorithm for 3D map construction. Since our application involves RGB-D image sequences with minimal variation between successive key frames, we use a scale-space pyramid and FAST techniques to select a limited number of key points, reducing the computational load. Moreover, by employing a local optical flow-based point-matching approach, we eliminate resource-intensive operations in each ICP optimization iteration. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method through a virtual 3D drone flight simulator."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927e878c28a047396b56","65bcae864097077956886909"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-6","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65bcae864097077956886909","5e70927e878c28a047396b56"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"65bca742409707795687f681","doi":"10.1109/icecet58911.2023","title":"2023 International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Energy Technologies (ICECET)","year":2023,"isbn":"979-8-3503-2781-6","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10389177/proceeding","translation":false,"documentHash":"ecda5b54-bba5-4db5-9330-c33cf809a1c1","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7fc","mniswId":"26900","name":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","documentHash":"b80f2dd5-e346-440a-b828-4712b50be331"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["registration","drone operation simulation","structure from motion","ICP"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654933342"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b795f74097073a075a2de6","name":"Shuisheng","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"009b744f-731a-4f42-82c1-2b4bd9ee68c1"},{"objectId":"65b795f74097073a075a2de5","name":"Dong","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"755371e6-7635-4696-a2c4-3274bd44636a"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"65b795f74097073a075a2de3","doi":"10.1109/tkde.2023.3273274","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122981","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Accelerated Fuzzy C-Means Clustering Based on New Affinity Filtering and Membership Scaling","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is a widely used clustering method. However, FCM and its many accelerated variants have low efficiency in the mid-to-late stage of the clustering process. In this stage, all samples are involved in updating their non-affinity centers, and the membership grades of most samples, whose assignments remain unchanged, are still updated by calculating the sample-center distances. All these factors lead to the algorithms converging slowly. In this paper, a new affinity filtering technique is developed to recognize a complete set of non-affinity centers for each sample with low computations. Then, a new membership scaling technique is suggested to set the membership grades between each sample and its non-affinity centers to 0 and maintain the fuzzy membership grades for others. By integrating these two techniques, FCM based on new affinity filtering and membership scaling (AMFCM) is proposed to accelerate the whole convergence process of FCM. Numerous experimental results performed on synthetic and real-world data sets have shown the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, AMFCM is significantly faster and more effective. For example, AMFCM reduces the number of FCM iterations by 80 % on average."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"35","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"12337-12349","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b795f74097073a075a2de5","65b795f74097073a075a2de6","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478003","mniswId":"7990","title":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","issn":"1041-4347","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"febb011e-59f0-4d1a-a72b-56e3164f2945"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b795f74097073a075a2de4","year":"2023","volume":"35","number":"12","documentHash":"4aa17389-8acf-4cd5-bdc8-d5a19d3a85db"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fuzzy C-means","affinity filtering","triangle inequality","non-affinity center","non-affinity sample","membership scaling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654933405"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65bcd25340970779568b6565","name":"Dong","lastName":"Yue","documentHash":"19f08c94-f901-4df8-921c-ecaba3830391"},{"objectId":"65bcd25340970779568b6564","name":"Chen","lastName":"Peng","documentHash":"3a9f01de-9889-4545-9c1a-c46cd0517333"},{"objectId":"65bcd25340970779568b6563","name":"Fumin","lastName":"Ma","documentHash":"5fe49df1-55a5-4532-bfc9-1bee1b1f01d8"},{"objectId":"65bcd25340970779568b6562","name":"Yudi","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"0d0e97bf-3c3f-437c-b8e3-51b41193e275"},{"objectId":"65bcd25340970779568b6561","name":"Tengfei","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"ce66dcf5-51b2-4ea5-8024-51fcefc70354"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"65bcd25340970779568b6560","doi":"10.1109/tcyb.2023.3257274","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10089155","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Local Boundary Fuzzified Rough K-Means-Based Information Granulation Algorithm Under the Principle of Justifiable Granularity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Information granularity and information granules are fundamental concepts that permeate the entire area of granular computing. With this regard, the principle of justifiable granularity was proposed by Pedrycz, and subsequently a general two-phase framework of designing information granules based on Fuzzy C-means clustering was successfully developed. This design process leads to information granules that are likely to intersect each other in substantially overlapping clusters, which inevitably leads to some ambiguity and misperception as well as loss of semantic clarity of information granules. This limitation is largely due to imprecise description of boundary-overlapping data in the existing algorithms. To address this issue, the rough k -means clustering is introduced in an innovative way into Pedrycz’s two-phase information granulation framework, together with the proposed local boundary fuzzy metric. To further strengthen the characteristics of support and inhibition of boundary-overlapping data, an augmented parametric version of the principle is refined. On this basis, a local boundary fuzzified rough k -means-based information granulation algorithm is developed. In this manner, the generated granules are unique and representative whilst ensuring clearer boundaries. The validity and performance of this algorithm are demonstrated through the results of comparative experiments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"54","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"519-532","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65bcd25340970779568b6561","65bcd25340970779568b6562","65bcd25340970779568b6563","65bcd25340970779568b6564","65bcd25340970779568b6565","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fec","mniswId":"7967","title":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","issn":"2168-2267","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c0bf8f9d-14c5-4757-a7dd-adaa18c03c9e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b7910a4097073a075974ef","year":"2024","volume":"54","number":"1","documentHash":"112af5e9-1f64-4e90-a2e2-c5e16527e00c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Information granularity","local boundary fuzzy metric","overlapping data","principle of justifiable granularity","rough k-means clustering"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654933805"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65c36abf4097074c89ddb7a2","name":"Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam","lastName":"Suganthan","documentHash":"f0154a4d-6ff5-4c69-a77b-11a978053236"},{"objectId":"65c36abf4097074c89ddb7a1","name":"Ling","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"c5a95bc5-e4fb-4fbd-a5e0-bbce887d1905"},{"objectId":"65c36abf4097074c89ddb7a0","name":"Guohua","lastName":"Wu","documentHash":"67940371-2a8b-4ffb-a059-7c3b02b81b6e"},{"objectId":"65c36abf4097074c89ddb79f","name":"Huan","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"5485d82b-cb39-4155-9125-8cdfa1f5d435"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"65c36abf4097074c89ddb79d","doi":"10.1109/tits.2023.3285568","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159549","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Tangent-Based Path Planning for UAV in a 3-D Low Altitude Urban Environment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as promising platforms for fast, energy-efficient, and cost-effective package delivery. Path planning in 3-D urban environments is critical to drone delivery. The paper proposes a novel tangent-based (3D-TG) method for UAV path planning in 3-D urban environments. When a drone encounters an obstacle, a tangent graph is constructed to generate three sub-paths from both sides and above to bypass an obstacle, one of which is selected according to sophistically designed heuristic rules. The selected sub-path would be constantly adjusted its direction via tangent graph to avoid obstacles until the path can extend to the goal without obstacle collision. To avoid moving obstacles, velocity obstacle is incorporated in the 3D-TG. The experimental results on synthetic and realistic scenarios illustrate that 3D-TG performs well under static, unknown and dynamic environments. More significantly, 3D-TG can also generate a collision-free path for a drone to navigate through simple mazes efficiently, within a reasonable time."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"12062-12077","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65c36abf4097074c89ddb79f","65c36abf4097074c89ddb7a0","65c36abf4097074c89ddb7a1","5e70922b878c28a047391011","65c36abf4097074c89ddb7a2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478002","mniswId":"7989","title":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","issn":"1524-9050","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4c1c29ee-ee5e-439c-90b9-c7835ecd1651"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c36abf4097074c89ddb79e","year":"2023","volume":"24","number":"11","documentHash":"1043d01b-a9fd-4f1a-91f6-63ceb1a048a2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Tangent graph","path planning","obstacle avoidance","velocity obstacle","3-D urban environment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654936739"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b45","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Miroforidis","uuid":"829C65C42D934B7829E19305CA23CB7DB1C3F059A8031B7AE72ED4E6EEACC3752D47193388E412A0BA6231C88B92D2C4B4E8B75B962426B4E2BE0AC578931D39","documentHash":"e7f740ac-f37c-4ab8-8121-7f623133c0db"},{"objectId":"5e7091f8878c28a04738de7d","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"FILCEK","uuid":"640A97D34E7D4BF814BD15AE8DDC190AEF26935DE2E019CF74DE586B33DA3B9E0BE4D2FAC6CC2C0BAD926174D540697F1E6E6A644791851A4D7669A1F129C179","orcidId":"0000-0002-9760-0656","documentHash":"83156d1c-61d5-4764-a161-39a18a5e4c70"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67498b5efdbe8325166540de","doi":"10.15388/24-infor549","publicUri":"https://informatica.vu.lt/journal/INFORMATICA/article/1331/text","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A General Framework for Providing Interval Representations of Pareto Optimal Outcomes for Large-Scale Bi- and Tri-Criteria MIP Problems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Multi-Objective Mixed-Integer Programming (MOMIP) problem is one of the most challenging. To derive its Pareto optimal solutions one can use the well-known Chebyshev scalarization and Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solvers. However, for a large-scale instance of the MOMIP problem, its scalarization may not be solved to optimality, even by state-of-the-art optimization packages, within the time limit imposed on optimization. If a MIP solver cannot derive the optimal solution within the assumed time limit, it provides the optimality gap, which gauges the quality of the approximate solution. However, for the MOMIP case, no information is provided on the lower and upper bounds of the components of the Pareto optimal outcome. For the MOMIP problem with two and three objective functions, an algorithm is proposed to provide the so-called interval representation of the Pareto optimal outcome designated by the weighting vector when there is a time limit on solving the Chebyshev scalarization. Such interval representations can be used to navigate on the Pareto front.

The construction of easily describable and interpretable classification rules is of vital importance in pattern recognition. In this study, we propose a development of fuzzy rule-based classifier for multiclass classification problems and elaborate on a privacy-preserving realization of the proposed methodology in the presence of decentralized datasets. Fuzzy rule-based models provide an effective and efficient alternative for characterizing the complex relationship between the input variables and target classes. An overall design process of the proposed classifier consists of two main phases: (a) formation of information granules (clusters) to reveal the underlying structure of the training data, and (b) construction of local classification rules whose outputs reflect the probability distribution of the input data over all the classes. The constructed information granules form a backbone of the architecture of the classifier while the optimization of the parameters of local rules is carried out through using a gradient descent method with the guidance of the cross-entropy loss function. Furthermore, a federated gradient-based optimization mechanism is utilized to construct fuzzy classifier in a privacy-preserving approach. The originalities of the proposed methodology are twofold: first, a design of fuzzy classifier through the synergy of cluster-centric architecture and the cross-entropy loss function is presented. Second, we augment the proposed fuzzy classifier based on the concept of federated learning such that it can learn from distributed data without sacrificing data security and confidentiality. Experiments are carried out on a two-dimensional synthetic dataset and a number of real-world datasets. Experimental results show the excellent classification capability of the proposed classifier realized in the centralized way and in the federated learning environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"5098-5108","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677e442ffdbe8372a5e9a0e1","677e442ffdbe8372a5e9a0e2","677e442ffdbe8372a5e9a0e3","5e70922b878c28a047391011","677e442ffdbe8372a5e9a0e4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ff6","mniswId":"7978","title":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issn":"1063-6706","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2707d48e-bd2d-4094-8688-dbcf61c20fb1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677e442ffdbe8372a5e9a0e0","year":"2024","volume":"32","number":"9","documentHash":"2d0df37d-9c1e-4655-9e69-8facdf446fec"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Classification","cross entropy","fuzzy rule-based classifier","horizontal federated learning","softmax"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654947989"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677d374dfdbe833088b0b202","name":"Kisung","lastName":"Seo","documentHash":"fcca6779-b7a3-46f7-87c9-7468bac625af"},{"objectId":"677d374dfdbe833088b0b201","name":"Lin","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"5e039e72-d5ec-4e32-a17d-cf5a2623f7d3"},{"objectId":"677d374dfdbe833088b0b200","name":"Bo","lastName":"Yang","documentHash":"7f87e242-f122-4973-adba-fd1e771e6a43"},{"objectId":"677d374dfdbe833088b0b1ff","name":"Sung-Kwun","lastName":"Oh","documentHash":"ab2ccf7d-58dd-4b3f-bea3-ce500541c75c"},{"objectId":"677d374dfdbe833088b0b1fe","name":"Shuangrong","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"0011e542-9cbb-47cb-88f7-dccef29e54bb"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"677d374dfdbe833088b0b1fc","doi":"10.1109/tcyb.2024.3353753","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10453219","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Fuzzy Adaptive Knowledge-Based Inference Neural Networks: Design and Analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A novel fuzzy adaptive knowledge-based inference neural network (FAKINN) is proposed in this study. Conventional fuzzy cluster-based neural networks (FCBNNs) suffer from the challenge of a direct extraction of fuzzy rules that can capture and represent the interclass heterogeneity and intraclass homogeneity when the data possess complex structures. Moreover, the capability of the cluster-based rule generator in FCBNNs may decrease with the increase of data dimensionality. These drawbacks impede the generation of desired fuzzy rules, and affect the inference results depending on the fuzzy rules, thereby limiting their generalization ability. To address these drawbacks, an adaptive knowledge generator (AKG), consisting of the observation paradigm (OP) and clustering strategy (CS), is effectively designed to improve the generalization ability in FAKINN. The OP distills the characteristic information (CI) from data to highlight the homogeneity and heterogeneity of objects, and the CS, viz., the weighted condition-driven fuzzy clustering method (WCFCM), is proposed to summarize the CI to construct fuzzy rules. Moreover, the feedback between the OP and CS can control the dimensionality of CI, which endows FAKINN with the potential to tackle high-dimensional data. The main originality of the study focuses on the AKG and WCFCM that are proposed to develop the structural design methodology of FNNs. The performance of FAKINN is evaluated on various benchmarks with 27 comparative methods, and two real-world problems are adopted to validate its effectiveness. Experimental results show that FAKINN outperforms the comparison methods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"54","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"4875-4888","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677d374dfdbe833088b0b1fe","677d374dfdbe833088b0b1ff","5e70922b878c28a047391011","677d374dfdbe833088b0b200","677d374dfdbe833088b0b201","677d374dfdbe833088b0b202"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fec","mniswId":"7967","title":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","issn":"2168-2267","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c0bf8f9d-14c5-4757-a7dd-adaa18c03c9e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677d374dfdbe833088b0b1fd","year":"2024","volume":"54","number":"9","documentHash":"ebad5677-e368-40fc-bffb-11d97bf9b96b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fuzzy adaptive knowledge base","fuzzy clustering","fuzzy neural network (FNN)","observer","successive learning"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654948128"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6777e592fdbe833ec1cc6109","name":"Jose Aurelio","lastName":"Medina-Garrido","documentHash":"baaeea9a-abe1-4708-94e5-56047696ca5c"},{"objectId":"6777e592fdbe833ec1cc6108","name":"María Paula Lechuga","lastName":"Sancho","documentHash":"719dee52-80f5-4160-a21d-beea05d9de38"},{"objectId":"6777e592fdbe833ec1cc6107","name":"Alicia Maria Martín","lastName":"Navarro","documentHash":"feb9cb1d-c0b7-449a-bd1f-28eb024badff"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde28","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Szelągowski","uuid":"27F74A4788BFD3CE18AFEB15DDFD6AF68BFD26DF42B08C891FC5799E5B821C30B1F9540493266D7BECFDE07FFF614A4D3046CB12C2036C95DBF88BD8E077B779","orcidId":"0000-0002-5114-6793","documentHash":"e3659fe9-4b80-4538-b542-c25ae66f4639"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2025},"objectId":"6777e592fdbe833ec1cc6105","doi":"10.4018/joeuc.364099","publicUri":"https://www.igi-global.com/gateway/article/364099","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Is User Perception the Key to Unlocking the Full Potential of Business Process Management Systems (BPMS)?: Enhancing BPMS Efficacy Through User Perception","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study investigates factors influencing employees' perceptions of the usefulness of Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) in commercial settings.

To address these issues, in this study, revolving around the parabolic granular data, we propose an overall architecture for parabolic granular modeling and clustering. To begin with, novel coverage and specificity functions are established, and then a parabolic granular data structure is proposed. The fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is used to obtain the numeric prototypes, and then particle swarm optimization (PSO) is introduced to construct the parabolic granular data from the global perspective under the guidance of principle of justifiable granularity (PJG). Combining the advantages of FCM and PSO, we propose the parabolic granular modeling and optimization (PGMO) method. Moreover, we put forward attribute weights and sample weights as well as a distance measure induced by the Gaussian kernel similarity, and then come up with the algorithm of weighted kernel fuzzy clustering for parabolic granularity (WKFC-PG). In addition, the assessment mechanism of parabolic granular clustering is discussed. In summary, we set up an overall architecture including parabolic granular modeling, clustering, and assessment. Finally, comparative experiments on artificial, UCI, and high-dimensional datasets validate that our overall architecture delivers a good improvement over previous strategies. The parameter analysis and time complexity are also given for WKFC-PG. In contrast with related granular clustering algorithms, it is observed that WKFC-PG performs better than other granular clustering algorithms and has superior stability in handling outliers, especially on high-dimensional datasets."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"5","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"3728-3742","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677d49acfdbe833088b1c9a6","677d49acfdbe833088b1c9a7","5e70922b878c28a047391011","677d49acfdbe833088b1c9a8","677d49acfdbe833088b1c9a9","677d49acfdbe833088b1c9aa","677d49acfdbe833088b1c9ab"]},"journal":{"objectId":"64f04bf6cf9a7471b0ea3e00","mniswId":"31255","title":"IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence","eissn":"2691-4581","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"08a5b809-247a-444b-9f18-622d209a99b2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677d49acfdbe833088b1c9a5","year":"2024","volume":"5","number":"7","documentHash":"1381691b-a5a5-4d83-96ca-4246a55375c0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Clustering","fuzzy clustering","fuzzy set theory","granular computing (GRC)","unsupervised learning"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654948216"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e54bffdbe8372a5ec7286","name":"Yue","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"c70fe644-a0b0-4b7d-b0a3-4a037db755b9"},{"objectId":"677e54bffdbe8372a5ec7285","name":"Dongming","lastName":"Fan","documentHash":"68c77cc0-9760-41b2-aed2-6e8af3beb437"},{"objectId":"677e54bffdbe8372a5ec7284","name":"Ran","lastName":"Yan","documentHash":"edab4e84-09d2-4458-a91e-80d8882f1ba2"},{"objectId":"677e54bffdbe8372a5ec7283","name":"Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam","lastName":"Suganthan","documentHash":"5d610789-b944-4005-b422-1224d64eaaca"},{"objectId":"677e54bffdbe8372a5ec7282","name":"Yanjie","lastName":"Song","documentHash":"a77b3481-7d9c-4261-898b-7107418b28e6"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"677e54bffdbe8372a5ec7280","doi":"10.1109/taes.2024.3371964","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10463527","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Energy-Efficient Satellite Range Scheduling Using a Reinforcement Learning-Based Memetic Algorithm","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The rapid expansion of the satellite industry has presented numerous opportunities across various sectors and significantly transformed people's daily lives. However, the high energy consumption resulting from frequent task execution poses challenges for satellite management. Energy consumption has become an important factor to be considered in the design of future satellite management systems. The energy-efficient satellite range scheduling problem (EESRSP) aims to optimize task sequencing profits within the satellite management system while simultaneously conserving energy. To address this problem, a mixed-integer scheduling model is constructed, taking into account the energy consumption of ground stations during telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C) operations. Then, we propose a reinforcement learning-based memetic algorithm (RL-MA) that incorporates a heuristic initialization method (HIM). The HIM enables the algorithm to rapidly generate high-quality initial solutions by leveraging task features associated with EESRSRP. RL-MA employs both population search and local search (LS) techniques to explore the satellite TT&C task plan. RL-MA incorporates two genetic operators, crossover and mutation, into the population-based search. In the LS stage, multiple random and heuristic LS operators are incorporated through an ensemble LS strategy. To improve search performance, Q-learning, a classical class of reinforcement learning (RL) methods tailored to problem characteristics, is utilized for selecting effective operators. RL dynamically adjusts LS operators based on strategy performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-MA can effectively generate sound solutions for EESRSP with varying task scales. Furthermore, the improvement strategies employed in the algorithm are validated to enhance the scheduling performance of RL-MA. This study reveals that integrating RL with an ensemble of LS operators can significantly enhance the algorithm's exploit capability. Moreover, this LS approach applies to solving other types of satellite scheduling problems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"60","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"4073-4087","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677e54bffdbe8372a5ec7282","677e54bffdbe8372a5ec7283","5e70922b878c28a047391011","677e54bffdbe8372a5ec7284","677e54bffdbe8372a5ec7285","677e54bffdbe8372a5ec7286"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fd7","mniswId":"7941","title":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","issn":"0018-9251","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"39dbab1f-401a-4867-a126-460e3ab3f506"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677e54bffdbe8372a5ec7281","year":"2024","volume":"60","number":"4","documentHash":"183b55db-7890-4524-8d46-9b0d677ae296"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Energy-efficient","ensemble of local search (LS) methods","heuristic","memetic algorithm (MA)","reinforcement learning (RL)","satellite range scheduling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654948447"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67657277fdbe832d0ce700cd","name":"Yixin","lastName":"Tan","documentHash":"49f649bb-2154-4053-85f2-2eb4275c3d0e"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396dab","name":"Jan","lastName":"Sokołowski","uuid":"D86F76C962EA4F52C42EC0E2867AFE870286266A7B8FACAAA324F869A573E8589798B0DD2700B73686277707B16BBD81D2D84C00FEE9C0AA49AAB989F7376D7A","documentHash":"8831a331-385f-4d75-bf78-45626a80b1b0"}],"objectId":"67657277fdbe832d0ce700cc","doi":"10.1109/mmar62187.2024.10680821","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680821","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Optimal control and optimum design of elasticity system: Topological derivative method for control problem","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We consider a class of boundary dynamic optimal control problems for elasticity systems in the geometric domain.

However, two practical considerations are rarely mentioned in the mechanism research on the problem of diffusion-coupled cellular neural networks (CNNs): the effects of memristor and three-dimensional (3-D) network structure. Furthermore, facilitating the formation of the determined Turing pattern is expected to make the neural network exhibit the desired intelligence. This paper first realizes the 3-D diffusive networking for a primary cell circuit with memristor characteristics and utilizes a proportional-derivative (PD) control strategy to drive the pattern formation. Next, the characteristic equation is derived using the spatial eigenfunction-based decoupling method. Then, by tracing the root distribution of the characteristic equation, some analytical conditions for the stability or forming Turing patterns are deduced. In addition, the central manifold reduction and linear analysis approaches are utilized to derive the amplitude equations of 3-D Turing patterns and investigate their stability. At last, some numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the results. It is also demonstrated that PD control and memristor occupy dominant positions in various CNNs’ Turing patterns. After determining the pattern stability, the implementation of PD control can be considered an effective means to facilitate stable networks to experience Turing instability and generate switchable 3-D pattern."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"71","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"4131-4144","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677e7677fdbe8372a5f132cf","677e7677fdbe8372a5f132d0","677e7677fdbe8372a5f132d1","677e7677fdbe8372a5f132d2","677e7677fdbe8372a5f132d3","5e709200878c28a04738e75e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fe4","mniswId":"7953","title":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","issn":"1549-8328","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"247283e6-73ba-4599-aabd-5d1b48fa5f88"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677e7677fdbe8372a5f132ce","year":"2024","volume":"71","number":"9","documentHash":"c1c20a15-3627-49b1-9b27-b473b116f98b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cellular neural networks","memristor","diffusion","PD control","stability","Turing instability","3-D pattern formation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654951418"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67810a7cfdbe834a810c5daf","name":"Zhou","lastName":"Su","documentHash":"42b55894-d6b4-4787-ba49-fa2cddff392d"},{"objectId":"67810a7cfdbe834a810c5dae","name":"Weizhi","lastName":"Meng","documentHash":"0f398c3d-e862-463f-8658-4109730e65da"},{"objectId":"67810a7cfdbe834a810c5dad","name":"Qinnan","lastName":"Hu","documentHash":"4c8bdde3-b4f1-4a2a-bd33-e835be64c19a"},{"objectId":"67810a7cfdbe834a810c5dac","name":"Jiliang","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"c46fa316-af5c-4bf0-b2a9-68482ff17d35"},{"objectId":"67810a7cfdbe834a810c5dab","name":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Jiang","documentHash":"99b5fdb4-9b0d-4a6b-ada0-d85d0f97649e"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"67810a7cfdbe834a810c5da9","doi":"10.1109/jiot.2024.3397364","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10522625","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Scalable Graph-Aware Edge Representation Learning for Wireless IoT Intrusion Detection","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) have emerged as a frontline defense against the potential attacks in the wireless Internet of Things (IoT) networks.

In this study, we propose the graph isomorphism network model based on the edge (GINE), an innovative graph-based algorithm tailored to pinpoint the malicious network traffic within the wireless IoT networks. Specifically, we initiate by presenting the wireless IoT network graph, capturing the global topological interactions of its edges. Subsequently, we design an edge representation learning algorithm, capable of encoding network data frames in a discerning pattern-aware manner. Moreover, we integrate a data interpolation module into the edges of our structured graph data targeting at the data imbalance, which fosters a more balanced distribution across the various classes of edges. Our empirical analysis on the selected wireless IoT intrusion data sets shows GINE’s superiority, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art methods in classification metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, false alarm rate, etc. Through a simulated wireless environment, we demonstrate GINE’s robust scalability, even in unpredictable wireless networks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"16","pagesFromTo":"26955-26969","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67810a7cfdbe834a810c5dab","67810a7cfdbe834a810c5dac","67810a7cfdbe834a810c5dad","67810a7cfdbe834a810c5dae","5e70922b878c28a047391011","67810a7cfdbe834a810c5daf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c327","mniswId":"7900","title":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","issn":"2327-4662","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"83cc7d56-ddb9-4546-ad50-11eb4ad05d3e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67810a7cfdbe834a810c5daa","year":"2024","volume":"11","number":"16","documentHash":"7be4ab6e-7824-49db-bc88-7e414f2ceb2c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Edge representation learning","graph neural network (GNN)","intrusion detection","wireless network"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654951578"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678e3801fdbe8352f866fcd5","name":"Zeyue","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"06faf75b-1cb8-4224-a532-7f984188a526"},{"objectId":"678e3801fdbe8352f866fcd4","name":"Shoucheng","lastName":"Yan","documentHash":"152055ea-b2f4-4f80-8e13-ba06ac7278d3"},{"objectId":"678e3801fdbe8352f866fcd3","name":"Xia","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"0c5c17d9-f6de-49fb-a960-f1dcfd578001"},{"objectId":"678e3801fdbe8352f866fcd2","name":"Wenfei","lastName":"Cao","documentHash":"bf7c97ec-38a6-405b-b41d-fd26e0c8c1e6"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e6d","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Cichocki","uuid":"A492EA7996E0A2D8AA1438AFDB549E6A5A1627A6E51EF9CB549D43021827C0CE3BEF148F04062455C1FEEF399F0B443F37BE01513DD8B4FBA42D8808390D6CC8","documentHash":"532d2c49-9c8b-47a0-9afc-e7fc7d95fd74"}],"objectId":"678e3801fdbe8352f866fcd0","doi":"10.1109/tsp.2024.3427136","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596996","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"1-Bit Tensor Completion via Max-and-Nuclear-Norm Composite Optimization","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"With the emergence of various tensor data, tensor completion from one-bit measurements has received widespread attention as a fundamental inverse problem. Since tensor rank is a crucial measure of the intrinsic structure in many tensor data and its definition is not yet unique, many convex surrogates of tensor rank have been proposed to solve this problem, which owns the merits of computational tractability and reliable theoretical guarantees. In this paper, a novel tensor max-norm is introduced by approximating low-rankness of each frontal slice in a transformed 3-order tensor, and its high-order extension is also discussed. Then, for one-bit tensor completion, an estimator related to the proposed tensor max-norm and another estimator involving the hybrid between tensor max-norm and tensor nuclear-norm are presented, where the first estimator can be considered as a special case of the second estimator. The statistical analysis of upper bounds is also established for recovery error of the two estimators. The theoretical results indicate that the upper bound of the second estimator is superior to the first one with the gap of order O(log((n1+n2)n3)−−−−−−−−−−−−−√). In addition, a lower bound of recovery error of the worst-case estimator is provided to show that the two estimators are nearly order-optimal. Furthermore, an algorithm based on the alternating direction multipliers method (ADMM) and semi-definite programming (SDP) is developed to solve the estimation models. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified through the simulated experiments and a practical application in recommender-system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709273878c28a047395e6d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"72","pagesFromTo":"3487-3501","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["678e3801fdbe8352f866fcd2","678e3801fdbe8352f866fcd3","678e3801fdbe8352f866fcd4","678e3801fdbe8352f866fcd5","5e709273878c28a047395e6d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547801a","mniswId":"8017","title":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issn":"1053-587X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"80d2c21b-5b2b-47e2-b303-794015042c31"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678e3801fdbe8352f866fcd1","year":"2024","volume":"72","documentHash":"720d8b2e-431e-4e57-9142-8066393d677b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["One-bit tensor completion","tensor decomposition","tensor norm","theoretical guarantee","high-order tensors"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654951906"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67890140fdbe83734564c3e0","name":"Toshihisa","lastName":"Tanaka","documentHash":"d0ea10e7-8bae-4512-b7e2-b5acacc4ae98"},{"objectId":"67890140fdbe83734564c3df","name":"Auxiliadora","lastName":"Sarmiento","documentHash":"928400fe-5327-48e6-bfcf-0db091104263"},{"objectId":"67890140fdbe83734564c3de","name":"Sergio","lastName":"Cruces","documentHash":"8d349871-b24c-4d12-9507-ec6cac2415fc"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e6d","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Cichocki","uuid":"A492EA7996E0A2D8AA1438AFDB549E6A5A1627A6E51EF9CB549D43021827C0CE3BEF148F04062455C1FEEF399F0B443F37BE01513DD8B4FBA42D8808390D6CC8","documentHash":"532d2c49-9c8b-47a0-9afc-e7fc7d95fd74"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67890140fdbe83734564c3dd","doi":"10.1109/access.2024.3520389","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807168","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Generalized Exponentiated Gradient Algorithms and Their Application to On-Line Portfolio Selection","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and exponentiated gradient (EG) update methods are widely used in signal processing and machine learning.

The EGAB framework provides enhanced flexibility for processing data with varying distributions, thanks to the tunable hyperparameters of the AB divergence. We explore the applicability of these updates in online portfolio selection (OLPS) for financial markets with the goal of developing algorithms that achieve high risk-adjusted returns, even under relatively high transaction costs. The proposed EGAB algorithms are developed using constrained gradient optimization with regularization terms, demonstrating their versatility in OLPS by unifying the directional search of various algorithms and enabling interpolation between them. Our analysis and extensive computer simulations reveal that EGAB updates outperform existing OLPS algorithms, delivering good results on several performance metrics, such as cumulative return, average excess return, Sharpe ratio, and Calmar ratio, especially when transaction costs are significant.

Aiming at solving this defect in OACCA, we designed an online spatial–temporal equalization filter (STE) to suppress the background noise component in the electroencephalography (EEG). Meanwhile, an adaptive decoding method for SSVEP based on online spatial–temporal estimation (STE-OACCA) is proposed by combining the online STE filter and the OACCA algorithm. A pseudoonline test on the Tsinghua University FBCCA-DW dataset shows that the proposed STE-OACCA method significantly outperforms the CCA, MSI, OACCA approaches as well as STE-CCA. More importantly, proposed method can be directly used in online SSVEP recognition without calibration. The proposed algorithm is robust, which is promising for the development of practical brain computer interface (BCI)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709273878c28a047395e6d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1943-1954","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6790a7befdbe835da5479989","6790a7befdbe835da547998a","6790a7befdbe835da547998b","6790a7befdbe835da547998c","6790a7befdbe835da547998d","5e709273878c28a047395e6d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c332","mniswId":"7955","title":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems","issn":"2379-8920","eissn":"2379-8939","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"37ee03a2-6d1a-4bbf-bc85-d68dd64da9bb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6790a7befdbe835da5479988","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"6","documentHash":"c8ee7283-d142-4415-a1aa-d3704a5973d5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Brain computer interface (BCI)","common spatial filter","electroencephalography (EEG)","online adaptive canonical correction analysis (OACCA)","online spatial–temporal estimation (STE)","steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654951964"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677f88eafdbe831a91cf2070","name":"Tingwen","lastName":"Huang","documentHash":"1dea7ccb-f576-469d-bc47-151f167da234"},{"objectId":"677f88eafdbe831a91cf206f","name":"Yong","lastName":"Xu","documentHash":"1b882294-a697-4955-bef3-ec71dc92106c"},{"objectId":"677f88eafdbe831a91cf206e","name":"Chang","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"0e64e241-d771-44c1-aab2-84d8879cdb93"},{"objectId":"677f88eafdbe831a91cf206d","name":"Weijun","lastName":"Lv","documentHash":"cec81845-4e9e-4e94-b012-c55388e29b79"},{"objectId":"677f88eafdbe831a91cf206c","name":"Zenghong","lastName":"Huang","documentHash":"f9d7ef67-0153-4876-af51-769e6b44b609"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e75e","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"A56F3A8C2F6246587B88982FE48FEA2855A7B5222539A126265F1D882510368FD87B8932975E7451D01686982B7D3158DA885EF3F5FFA39E4B9D9EE6FD22470F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6960-9525","documentHash":"715a0529-c457-4823-a66d-ee6bebb7dd83"}],"objectId":"677f88eafdbe831a91cf206a","doi":"10.1109/tii.2023.3316174","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10284044","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Event-Triggered Distributed Moving Horizon Estimation Over Wireless Sensor Networks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This work proposes a fully distributed moving horizon estimation method with an event-triggered communication strategy over wireless sensor networks.

Precise decoding, one of the most significant aspects of realizing efficient and stable interaction, has received a great deal of intensive research. However, the current decoding methods based on deep learning are still dominated by single-scale serial convolution, which leads to insufficient extraction of abundant information from motor imagery signals. To overcome such challenges, we propose a new end-to-end convolutional neural network based on multiscale spatial-temporal feature fusion (MSTFNet) for EEG classification of motor imagery. The architecture of MSTFNet consists of four distinct modules: feature enhancement module, multiscale temporal feature extraction module, spatial feature extraction module and feature fusion module, with the latter being further divided into the depthwise separable convolution block and efficient channel attention block. Moreover, we implement a straightforward yet potent data augmentation strategy to bolster the performance of MSTFNet significantly. To validate the performance of MSTFNet, we conduct cross-session experiments and leave-one-subject-out experiments. The cross-session experiment is conducted across two public datasets and one laboratory dataset. On the public datasets of BCI Competition IV 2a and BCI Competition IV 2b, MSTFNet achieves classification accuracies of 83.62% and 89.26%, respectively. On the laboratory dataset, MSTFNet achieves 86.68% classification accuracy. Besides, the leave-one-subject-out experiment is performed on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset, and MSTFNet achieves 66.31% classification accuracy. These experimental results outperform several state-of-the-art methodologies, indicate the proposed MSTFNet's robust capability in decoding EEG signals associated with motor imagery."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709273878c28a047395e6d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"198-209","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6790b190fdbe835da548524f","6790b190fdbe835da5485250","6790b190fdbe835da5485251","6790b190fdbe835da5485252","6790b190fdbe835da5485253","6790b190fdbe835da5485254","6790b190fdbe835da5485255","5e709273878c28a047395e6d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fb7","mniswId":"7901","title":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","issn":"2168-2194","eissn":"2168-2208","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"dd7b97f9-6710-40c6-a9e0-b3e855bdb7bd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6790b190fdbe835da548524e","year":"2025","volume":"29","number":"1","documentHash":"24986513-8eaf-49a5-8f1c-c36511c22806"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Motor imagery","convolution neural network","feature fusion","EEG classification"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654954803"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709460878c28a0473bbbab","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Sosnowski","uuid":"EC217826C3BD9E800AC770AAF7ADE389221E20F2AC1F8E13957820A7E9CD930FD81658784A88CEF6276D490CED4BF0FF798350782DBC0179F66E26BB90CBDDBE","documentHash":"95a6e722-9d76-4c3a-905b-ada8f6acfd96"},{"objectId":"5e70933f878c28a0473a5944","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Szymusik","uuid":"263F2AA4940A32163F3998B508E428674FD18EE45588B82195DE70A53A95FB87E6D2078F9B31C260A99E1EA8D2800A000446046406FB1981A99B4FC324DBA7CA","orcidId":"0000-0001-8106-5428","documentHash":"462f35d4-2df9-4827-aaca-4b6a65131654"}],"objectId":"67c833befdbe83551ec21caf","doi":"10.1109/bigdata62323.2024.10825443","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10825443","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Premenstrual Syndrome Detection Based on Granular Computing and AI in Home Environment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Premenstrual syndrome affects women’s daily functioning in various ways.

This paper develops a technique for calculating camera trajectories in a 3D global coordinate system assuming its swift motion. The proposed algorithm is based on a disparity rather than image depth approach. Moreover, a Laplacian pyramid and dense optical flow methods are used. Highly accurate matching of two consecutive keyframes is essential for reconstructing 3D scenes as it facilitates the retrieval of the three-dimensional geometry of the scene from captured images. Numerical tests are provided and confirm the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927e878c28a047396b56","67d40718fdbe830c1d97accf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-6","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67d40718fdbe830c1d97accf","5e70927e878c28a047396b56"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"67d40600fdbe830c1d97a09e","doi":"10.1109/icecet61485.2024","title":"2024 International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Energy Technologies (ICECET)","year":2024,"isbn":"979-8-3503-9591-4","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10697983/proceeding","translation":false,"documentHash":"32fe9ebf-89c2-476f-be84-aa34a80fe6ba","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7fc","mniswId":"26900","name":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","documentHash":"b80f2dd5-e346-440a-b828-4712b50be331"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["optical flow","dense tracking","camera tracking","registration"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654977018"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67e12957fdbe833fcf55939e","name":"Xingyu","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"52607285-6dcf-46f9-aacb-955e48dfbe6c"},{"objectId":"67e12957fdbe833fcf55939d","name":"Xin","lastName":"Long","documentHash":"b7f9a51e-f1d6-4f4c-8e06-e5204fa9e15e"},{"objectId":"67e12957fdbe833fcf55939c","name":"Ruiyu","lastName":"Zhao","documentHash":"da3ef032-7397-4773-9f0e-07f515812a68"},{"objectId":"67e12957fdbe833fcf55939b","name":"Ren","lastName":"Xu","documentHash":"66bdc705-95f4-4aed-bcce-0532e1c17e8b"},{"objectId":"67e12957fdbe833fcf55939a","name":"Xinjie","lastName":"He","documentHash":"b9eedc19-5ca2-4ea2-bfaf-c86b45a93de3"},{"objectId":"67e12957fdbe833fcf559399","name":"Jing","lastName":"Jin","documentHash":"11e7febf-33de-4037-9dd6-da1332c1d417"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e6d","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Cichocki","uuid":"A492EA7996E0A2D8AA1438AFDB549E6A5A1627A6E51EF9CB549D43021827C0CE3BEF148F04062455C1FEEF399F0B443F37BE01513DD8B4FBA42D8808390D6CC8","documentHash":"532d2c49-9c8b-47a0-9afc-e7fc7d95fd74"}],"objectId":"67e12957fdbe833fcf559398","doi":"10.1109/jiot.2024.3488957","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740024","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Cross-Stimulus Transfer Learning Framework Using Common Period Repetition Components for Fast Calibration of SSVEP-Based BCIs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The decoding approach of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) based on supervised learning has achieved remarkable results. However, these approaches require extensive calibration efforts to train the mode parameters for each stimulus. To facilitate the calibration process, we proposed a cross-stimulus transfer learning framework using the common periodic repetition components (CSTLF-CPRC) in fast calibration scenario. First, a source stimulus mode was constructed, which can use periodic repetition components to obtain a source synthetic SSVEP template and source ensemble spatial filter. Second, leveraging the common information between period repeated component templates across multistimulus periods, the common source aliasing matrix was further estimated. Finally, leveraging the commonality between target and source stimuli, a cross-stimulus transfer learning mode was constructed for SSVEP cross-stimulus recognition. Offline tests on public datasets show that the CSTLF-CPRC outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, such as filter band CCA, transfer learning CCA, and common impulse response cross-stimulus transfer learning, in a fast calibration scenario. Our method only needs 16 s to calibrate 40 targets on two public datasets and achieves an average information transfer rate of 227.86 ± 106.47 bit/min and 162.41 ± 124.29 bit/min, respectively. The study has the requirement of a few calibration data to achieve high-performance recognition and to promote effective development of the practical system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709273878c28a047395e6d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"5719-5731","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67e12957fdbe833fcf559399","67e12957fdbe833fcf55939a","67e12957fdbe833fcf55939b","67e12957fdbe833fcf55939c","67e12957fdbe833fcf55939d","67e12957fdbe833fcf55939e","5e709273878c28a047395e6d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c327","mniswId":"7900","title":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","issn":"2327-4662","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"83cc7d56-ddb9-4546-ad50-11eb4ad05d3e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67e12370fdbe833fcf555872","year":"2025","volume":"12","number":"5","documentHash":"ca4732ec-85f2-4f24-b8c6-75fdfb4668ac"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Common source aliasing matrix","cross-stimulus transfer","fast calibration scenario","period repetition components","steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654979269"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66cf15e2fdbe83138146f0ea","name":"Habibullah","lastName":"Habibullah","documentHash":"9be4c503-148a-48b6-a19a-a56a1edc7e62"},{"objectId":"66cf15e2fdbe83138146f0e9","name":"Lin","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"43548352-503d-43d6-af51-dee2a4c2498e"},{"objectId":"66cf15e2fdbe83138146f0e8","name":"Sreenatha","lastName":"Anavatti","documentHash":"485a5579-83de-4bf4-a955-00887ec25b4f"},{"objectId":"66cf15e2fdbe83138146f0e7","name":"Savitha","lastName":"Ramasamy","documentHash":"c131e440-b920-4f9b-a573-1c4f759c4975"},{"objectId":"66cf15e2fdbe83138146f0e6","name":"Mahardhika","lastName":"Pratama","documentHash":"eecbc383-2e23-4213-9889-1bbcef92b69d"},{"objectId":"66cf15e2fdbe83138146f0e5","name":"MD Rasel","lastName":"Sarkar","documentHash":"02f74694-e184-43bb-ab97-565ec2291ba0"},{"objectId":"66cf15e2fdbe83138146f0e4","name":"Muhammad Anwar","lastName":"Ma'sum","documentHash":"772b97c9-0671-4bc2-af7c-d7ca216cd253"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b824f","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"C34B5BD166A72CFDCC0BB81F0FDB001A2EDE06564A6A420DB551E449F90B32FE4A6FB188EDBECD9DF6A835B4137D2D211C3B8ED329F77D14EF31C15B1A21C073","documentHash":"08e43a2c-24f1-478e-8cb2-5570dec5908f"}],"objectId":"66cf15e2fdbe83138146f0e2","doi":"10.1109/tai.2024.3365775","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439265","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Dynamic Long-Term Time-Series Forecasting via Meta Transformer Networks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A reliable long-term time-series forecaster is highly demanded in practice but comes across many challenges such as low computational and memory footprints as well as robustness against dynamic learning environments. This article proposes meta-transformer networks (MANTRA) to deal with the dynamic long-term time-series forecasting tasks. MANTRA relies on the concept of fast and slow learners where a collection of fast learners learns different aspects of data distributions while adapting quickly to changes. A slow learner tailors suitable representations to fast learners. Fast adaptations to dynamic environments are achieved using the universal representation transformer (URT) layers producing task-adapted representations with a small number of parameters.

The P300 speller is an important application of ERP-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), offering potential assistance to individuals with severe motor disabilities by decoding their electroencephalography (EEG) to communicate. Methods: This study introduced a novel speller paradigm using a dynamically growing bubble (GB) visualization as the stimulus, departing from the conventional flash stimulus (TF). Additionally, we proposed a “Lock a Target by Two Flashes” (LT2F) method to offer more versatile stimulus flash rules, complementing the row and column (RC) and single character (SC) modes. We applied the “Sub and Global” multi-window mode to EEGNet (mwEEGNet) to enhance classification and explored the performance of eight other representative algorithms. Results: Twenty healthy volunteers participated in the experiments. Our analysis revealed that our proposed pattern elicited more pronounced negative peaks in the parietal and occipital brain regions between 200 ms and 230 ms post-stimulus onset compared with the TF pattern. Compared to the TF pattern, the GB pattern yielded a 2.00% increase in online character accuracy (ACC) and a 5.39 bits/min improvement in information transfer rate (ITR) when using mwEEGNet. Furthermore, results demonstrated that mwEEGNet outperformed other methods in classification performance.

Simultaneously, semantic technologies, especially in the streaming context, are becoming increasingly important for enabling interoperability in edge-cloud systems. However, in recent years, the field of semantic data streaming has been stagnant, and there are no available solutions that would fit those requirements. To fill this gap, in this contribution, a novel end-to-end RDF streaming approach is proposed (named Jelly). The method is simple to implement, yet very elastic, and designed to fit a wide variety of use cases. Its practical performance is evaluated in a series of experiments, including end-to-end throughput and latency measurements. It is shown that Jelly achieves vastly superior performance to the currently available approaches. The presented method makes significant progress towards enabling high-performance semantic data processing in numerous applications, including future edge-cloud systems. Moreover, this study opens up the possibility of applying and evaluating the method in real-life scenarios, which will be the focus of further research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67f3b547fdbe8303cff4380a","5e709264878c28a047394e98","5e709460878c28a0473bbbb2","5e709461878c28a0473bbde2","5e709241878c28a04739297b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-8","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67f3b547fdbe8303cff4380a","5e709460878c28a0473bbbb2","5e709241878c28a04739297b","5e70924f878c28a047393837","5e709461878c28a0473bbde2","5e709264878c28a047394e98"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"64c0f432409707196b34432c","doi":"10.1109/wf-iot54382.2022","title":"Proceedings of the 2022 IEEE 8th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)","year":2022,"isbn":"978-1-6654-9153-2","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10151825/proceeding","translation":false,"documentHash":"284419f0-5219-45e1-99f7-a2877c7caa01","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7fc","mniswId":"26900","name":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","documentHash":"b80f2dd5-e346-440a-b828-4712b50be331"}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["RDF","stream processing","edge-cloud continuum","Protocol Buffers","Apache Kafka","gRPC","large IoT ecosystems"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654982691"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676279ccfdbe837ab126b7e5","name":"Siang Yew","lastName":"Chong","documentHash":"fcb7f1ba-508e-4090-9c98-440b6d000290"},{"objectId":"676279ccfdbe837ab126b7e4","name":"Xin","lastName":"Yao","documentHash":"1fcf90ab-e005-47c7-b712-36fa70b29ae8"},{"objectId":"676279ccfdbe837ab126b7e3","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Duda","documentHash":"f2a7ddc7-0e1b-4a44-8a28-d4375cfbd2c4"},{"objectId":"676279ccfdbe837ab126b7e2","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kucaba","documentHash":"79b42dc2-af23-4bdb-b5c1-ae923e0bba2b"},{"objectId":"6545baba40e3ff4ef3f3fe7a","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Wojtulewicz","uuid":"6C5B014F9143CE123946ABA8036F4F7424666D4E0788F3B87C9F0E45002478D4A48031705160F3FEDD4CE45266E479990201CFEF1C0ECDB489F16F2F08513346","documentHash":"d7a11935-e35f-48f9-ae89-ac4525f92050"},{"objectId":"5e70932c878c28a0473a4543","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Urbańczyk","uuid":"39DEE213B8889AF4DA498FAC086EC2E249D7CA89240A58CFD7380D11420947561B6B3415EC03E39876A7CDDB77F515B922FD7E8963A2717581E1D1D9361B74BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-6040-554X","documentHash":"7d1dea89-1876-43a5-934e-871e63d9c60a"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391157","name":"Marek","lastName":"Kisiel-Dorohinicki","uuid":"12CD1820003B84C72FE761480FC641096598199918B7894233C09B80EF0E0B8420325F6E0E527A8EAED853DA1EE95453948A5D232E03FF52039DEF64228257F9","orcidId":"0000-0002-8459-1877","documentHash":"0dce9e4b-9f8d-4e96-a846-8bfac899be22"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a0473910f1","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Byrski","uuid":"94F2CA753EDD0D80A3F2DDEF45D4A4A9F1231BA596A92F02DB6424384E6EA4EF895A96B937D816065FCF16EFA1B3952851D66DA03244DF2E788765B966CCD602","orcidId":"0000-0001-6317-7012","documentHash":"3433fd74-9040-4cec-b59a-fafc478ebc14"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391000","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kacprzyk","uuid":"4A8B2CA444BD6ED60EACF6DE687FF3AF9E95EF07222C91937E5CA1F185E2124FF08DCD7D9A596E8E60911E67B522D3EBFC737B67D6B4294639E916338A719CCB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4187-5877","documentHash":"13701ef2-8325-46ae-a25f-9758ec64477a"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e75e","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"A56F3A8C2F6246587B88982FE48FEA2855A7B5222539A126265F1D882510368FD87B8932975E7451D01686982B7D3158DA885EF3F5FFA39E4B9D9EE6FD22470F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6960-9525","documentHash":"715a0529-c457-4823-a66d-ee6bebb7dd83"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-03-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"673dd64bfdbe8321548e7da1","doi":"10.14313/jamris/1-2024/1","publicUri":"https://www.jamris.org/index.php/JAMRIS/article/view/1039","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"$(\\mu + \\lambda)$ Evolution Strategy with socio-cognitive mutation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Socio-cognitive computing is a paradigm developed for the last several years in our research group.

Для осуществления наших целей мы применяем аппарат теории p-регулярности [6, 7, 15, 16] и показываем, что отображение F(u,ε) является 3-регулярным в точке (u∗,ε∗)=(0,0), т.е. p = 3."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a047398452","5e709294878c28a047398437"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a047398437"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"66e93b3efdbe8369ae9a4574","name":"Federal Research Center \"Computer Science and Control\" of Russian Academy of Sciences","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a047398437"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737ed49","name":"Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, null","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a047398437"],"type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"512","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"5-9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709294878c28a047398452","5e709294878c28a047398437"]},"journal":{"objectId":"63c9702e4097074220d0a451","title":"Doklady Rossijskoj akademii nauk.

Semi-Supervised Fuzzy C-Means (SSFCMeans), a specific model we consider, uses a single hyperparameter called a scaling factor α to weigh the impact of partially labeled data. This concept became widespread and was reused directly in many works building on SSFCMeans, or even applied to other fuzzy clustering algorithms, such as Possibilistic C-Means. However, none of the works challenged the original interpretation of α , which suggests that the impact of partial supervision is directly proportional to the scaling factor. We fill the above-mentioned research gap and thoroughly analyze this relationship. We provide novel explanations of the scaling factor α in terms of the key element of fuzzy clustering—the membership values. We prove that the impact of partial supervision is a nonlinear function of α . Our approach is rooted in the explainability framework, which distinguishes interpretation from an explanation and treats the latter as superior. Explaining the scaling factor leads to an explainable impact of partial supervision and enables greater control of it. Finally, built on the novel explanations, we propose a unified, analytically justified framework for selecting the value of the hyperparameter α that is based on the cross-validation approach. We illustrate that the proposed framework enables an extensive analysis of the impact of partial supervision in SSFCMeans with a simulation experiment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["616644a875234017e052cae5","5e709232878c28a0473918ef","5e709460878c28a0473bbb37"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"3189-3198","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["616644a875234017e052cae5","5e709460878c28a0473bbb37","5e709232878c28a0473918ef"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ff6","mniswId":"7978","title":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issn":"1063-6706","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2707d48e-bd2d-4094-8688-dbcf61c20fb1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66eaf1bafdbe836650b22464","year":"2024","volume":"32","number":"5","documentHash":"8e172f06-16cf-4831-93b3-ee6c33e8a3c2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Explainable artificial intelligence","Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)","fuzzy clustering","partial supervision","Possibilistic C-Means (PCM)","semi-supervised learning (SSL)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655022765"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6821c8cffdbe8356e57a9d70","name":"-","lastName":"Habibullah","documentHash":"205c9243-8c30-4e92-a777-24858e47fed6"},{"objectId":"6821c8cffdbe8356e57a9d6f","name":"Lin","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"57757989-6ac2-46b7-b3c2-4c4889a37d7b"},{"objectId":"6821c8cffdbe8356e57a9d6e","name":"Edwin","lastName":"Lughofer","documentHash":"a757dd1a-9f23-45a0-9032-f51654a9cc08"},{"objectId":"6821c8cffdbe8356e57a9d6d","name":"Mahardhika","lastName":"Pratama","documentHash":"06780d28-cdaa-402c-9e66-047e585fd693"},{"objectId":"6821c8cffdbe8356e57a9d6c","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Anwar Ma’Sum","documentHash":"f004aec4-0b71-4034-bdf1-781b9a080cbf"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b824f","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"C34B5BD166A72CFDCC0BB81F0FDB001A2EDE06564A6A420DB551E449F90B32FE4A6FB188EDBECD9DF6A835B4137D2D211C3B8ED329F77D14EF31C15B1A21C073","documentHash":"08e43a2c-24f1-478e-8cb2-5570dec5908f"}],"objectId":"6821c8cffdbe8356e57a9d6a","doi":"10.1109/tnnls.2024.3415048","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571377","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Few-Shot Continual Learning via Flat-to-Wide Approaches","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The existing approaches on continual learning (CL) call for a lot of samples in their training processes.

Different from the previous competitive networks and leakage-delayed networks, the activation functions are discontinuous and the leakage delays are nondifferential. Without using the Lyapunov function methods, the synchronization in a finite time is investigated based on the comparison principle and inequality techniques, which are used for the first time in the study of the competitive networks and leakage-delayed networks. Moreover, the feedback controller and bounded feedback controller are designed to help achieve the finite-time synchronization. The bounded feedback controller is formulated by the function arctan and a new inequality lemma is given, which plays a vital role in achieving the synchronization via bounded feedback controller. Although both controllers can help achieve the finite-time synchronization, it can be found that there is a big difference that the value of feedback controller is greatly influenced by system's state variables, but bounded controller is not. Such fact leads to different settling-times. The conclusion is that bounded controller has more advantages in shortening convergence time through numerical simulations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"3059-3070","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67627db6fdbe837ab128078c","67627db6fdbe837ab128078d","5e709200878c28a04738e75e","67627db6fdbe837ab128078e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ff6","mniswId":"7978","title":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issn":"1063-6706","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2707d48e-bd2d-4094-8688-dbcf61c20fb1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66eaf1bafdbe836650b22464","year":"2024","volume":"32","number":"5","documentHash":"8e172f06-16cf-4831-93b3-ee6c33e8a3c2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bounded feedback controller","comparison methods","competitive networks","finite-time (FnT) synchronization","nondifferential leakage delays"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655030609"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6772a392fdbe831015cb19ad","name":"Jian-Zhang","lastName":"Wu","documentHash":"4cb949d4-accf-4bd9-8a17-3499ba7a40b4"},{"objectId":"6772a392fdbe831015cb19ac","name":"Simon","lastName":"James","documentHash":"50d682b9-d3fb-4fac-aa57-c372142545e3"},{"objectId":"6772a392fdbe831015cb19ab","name":"Gleb","lastName":"Beliakov","documentHash":"91def791-2b38-492c-a3ac-3f89c74cce60"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395fcb","name":"Marek","lastName":"Gągolewski","uuid":"D1F789DA719ACDE4F786BBA60CF8D2DE726661D5A7E254F316F4820329A49BCFEEA3CF3ED30E610FD1925A22E44E517CE8570971F86F2FC086AC8F5C20BEE1C0","orcidId":"0000-0003-0637-6028","documentHash":"0308d267-3047-4e3d-a992-4311b211b0b2"}],"objectId":"6772a392fdbe831015cb19aa","doi":"10.1109/fuzz-ieee60900.2024.10611753","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10611753","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A Tractable Approach to Fitting the Choquet Integral for Explainable Prediction and Analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"When it comes to explainable prediction, there is great potential for modeling data with high accuracy and flexibility using fuzzy integrals such as the Choquet integral.

However, it is difficult to distinguish the semantic differences between the same linguistic term, and original linguistic term may not express flexible semantics, so that this will affect the precise of decision-making results. With the help of granular computing, this article adopts a new format of linguistic term, named as hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set with granularity level, to endow preference information with flexibility and at a specific granularity. Then, in this study, we propose a novel intelligent biobjective optimization method for large-scale group decision making, considering group consensus degree and group risk degree in the decision-making process, where group risk degree is measured from the motivation of portfolio risk. Differential evolution is used to handle biobjective optimization method to determine the optimal results. We also introduce an additive consistency measure and develop a method to derive the corresponding threshold values through Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, the case study and comparison results are covered to demonstrate the practicality and superiority of the proposed method. This work has some original points: 1) Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set with granularity level brings flexibility to the decision-making process. 2) Group consensus degree and group risk degree are involved in biobjective optimization method, where the group risk degree is measured from the motivation of portfolio risk. 3) A novel additive consistency measure is proposed and different threshold values of preference relations in different dimensions are derived."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"4759-4771","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677d523afdbe833088b21377","677d523afdbe833088b21378","677d523afdbe833088b21379","5e70922b878c28a047391011","677d523afdbe833088b2137a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ff6","mniswId":"7978","title":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issn":"1063-6706","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2707d48e-bd2d-4094-8688-dbcf61c20fb1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677d4c25fdbe833088b1d534","year":"2024","volume":"32","number":"8","documentHash":"747a038e-8d2c-4193-9afa-1a9310eaf028"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bi-objective optimization","hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relations with granularity levels","intelligent decision making","large-scale group decision making","portfolio risk"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655038018"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677d3296fdbe833088aed8eb","name":"Xinwang","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"d1b6da86-b3d3-4f1d-8130-47acd0f0d022"},{"objectId":"677d3296fdbe833088aed8ea","name":"Xiubin","lastName":"Zhu","documentHash":"e2ec240c-0f6e-459b-983a-203ba19ec412"},{"objectId":"677d3296fdbe833088aed8e9","name":"Xingchen","lastName":"Hu","documentHash":"5384918a-6de6-4606-8206-076e8e102b9a"},{"objectId":"677d3296fdbe833088aed8e8","name":"Huimin","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"2c4e4e36-ac93-4b6d-8e48-4d5ec7486812"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"677d3296fdbe833088aed8e6","doi":"10.1109/tkde.2024.3392247","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520931","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Application of Gradient Boosting in the Design of Fuzzy Rule-Based Regression Models","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study is devoted to the design of gradient boosted fuzzy rule-based models for regression problems.

Finally, a 90-nodal T-cell receptor signaling network is presented to illustrate the theoretical validity of the obtained results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"806-808","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677f9c3afdbe831a91d0c8b2","677f9c3afdbe831a91d0c8b3","677f9c3afdbe831a91d0c8b4","5e709200878c28a04738e75e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c33e","mniswId":"8036","title":"IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica","issn":"2329-9274","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b3b7af33-7da1-44c5-b130-72220bee4032"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677f9c3afdbe831a91d0c8b1","year":"2024","volume":"11","number":"3","documentHash":"33b59fbd-5ae3-46bd-a223-ee27ca4d5a86"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655038404"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e7fb8fdbe8372a5f1ed5d","name":"Shiyong","lastName":"Zhu","documentHash":"95efa79a-529d-4c21-a09d-6f4cf78e5063"},{"objectId":"677e7fb8fdbe8372a5f1ed5c","name":"Georgi Marko","lastName":"Dimirovski","documentHash":"88195e42-7e05-46b7-ab0a-015287aea369"},{"objectId":"677e7fb8fdbe8372a5f1ed5b","name":"James","lastName":"Lam","documentHash":"e8c3d42a-5f43-4c4e-ab89-83d61f43a9a5"},{"objectId":"677e7fb8fdbe8372a5f1ed5a","name":"Jinde","lastName":"Cao","documentHash":"fb81b26a-f232-4563-a8b7-7a8d9fc1e783"},{"objectId":"677e7fb8fdbe8372a5f1ed59","name":"Lin","lastName":"Lin","documentHash":"cec7b8a0-6444-46a8-aed0-5ef0c392b3bd"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e75e","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"A56F3A8C2F6246587B88982FE48FEA2855A7B5222539A126265F1D882510368FD87B8932975E7451D01686982B7D3158DA885EF3F5FFA39E4B9D9EE6FD22470F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6960-9525","documentHash":"715a0529-c457-4823-a66d-ee6bebb7dd83"}],"objectId":"677e7fb8fdbe8372a5f1ed57","doi":"10.1109/tac.2024.3354212","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10399803","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A Bisimulation-Based Foundation for Scale Reductions of Continuous-Time Markov Chains","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this article, the scale reduction problem of continuous-time Markov chains (CT-MCs) and continuous-time controlled Markov chains (CT-CMCs) are disserted both from the bisimulation perspective. Based on the features of bisimulation, the reachability, macro-controllability, controllability, and stabilizability of CT-MCs and CT-CMCs, particularly, the large-scale ones, are addressed over the corresponding reduced chains. The bisimulation relations are defined for both CT-MCs and CT-CMCs to establish the equivalence between the original networks and their condensed networks. A computable algorithm is developed to compute the reachability-based maximal bisimulation relation for CMCs, resulting in the smallest bisimulating CMCs. Notably, one advantage of our techniques lies in their efficiency in implementing the existing analysis and control results on MCs and CMCs in a lower amount of time, with wide applications to logical networks, finite-field networks, finite automata, and Petri nets. Compared to their discrete-time counterparts, CT-MCs and CT-CMCs inherit a simplified essential network topology in the discrete-time structures while providing a quantitative description of transient functional kinetics on the microtime scale level. Besides, all the developed theoretical results for CT-MCs and CT-CMCs are operated based on the transition rate matrices of chains rather than transition probability matrices used in the traditional methods.

To address the high time complexity associated with transition graphs and existing methods, we integrate the characteristic polynomial of the network matrix with the cycle and tree structures in the transition graph.

However, the necessary calibration procedures take time, cause visual fatigue and reduce usability. For the calibration-free scenario, we propose a cross-subject frequency identification method based on transfer superimposed theory for SSVEP frequency decoding. First, a multi-channel signal decomposition model was constructed. Next, we used the cross least squares iterative method to create individual specific transfer spatial filters as well as source subject transfer superposition templates in the source subject. Then, we identified common knowledge among source subjects using a prototype spatial filter to make common transfer spatial filters and common impulse responses. Following, we reconstructed a global transfer superimposition template with SSVEP frequency characteristics. Finally, an ensemble cross-subject transfer learning method was proposed for SSVEP frequency recognition by combining the source-subject transfer mode, the global transfer mode, and the sine-cosine reference template. Offline tests on two public datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the FBCCA, TTCCA, and CSSFT methods. More importantly, the proposed method can be directly used in online SSVEP recognition without calibration.

Traditional neuro-fuzzy models exhibit outstanding interpretability in the problems of lower dimensionality. However, when faced with high-dimensional scenarios, the long rule and rule explosion problems damage their interpretability and result in poor generalization performance, even making them unusable. Although deep neuro-fuzzy models show enhanced performance in handling high-dimensional problems compared to traditional counterparts, they often come at the expense of interpretability. To establish a neuro-fuzzy model that can address high-dimensional problems while preserving the interpretability, the SCINN is proposed with the aid of the concept-based measure generation paradigm (CMGP) and the multi-view information augmentation strategy (MIAS). The CMGP is designed to adaptively define the membership functions (MFs) that correspond to the human-understandable concepts based on the given data; the defined MFs contribute to the construction of the explainable fuzzy rule that can directly process high-dimensional data. The MIAS is structured to develop a unified paradigm for implementing consequence functions in the fuzzy rules, which enhances the approximation ability of the SCINN.

Machine Learning (ML) shows great potential for trust evaluation owing to its learning capabilities. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), as a new ML paradigm, have demonstrated superiority in dealing with graph data. This has motivated researchers to explore their use in trust evaluation, as trust relationships among entities can be modeled as a graph. However, current trust evaluation methods that employ GNNs fail to fully satisfy the dynamic nature of trust, overlook the adverse effects of trust-related attacks, and cannot provide convincing explanations on evaluation results. To address these problems, we propose TrustGuard, a GNN-based accurate trust evaluation model that supports trust dynamicity, is robust against typical attacks, and provides explanations through visualization. Specifically, TrustGuard is designed with a layered architecture that contains a snapshot input layer, a spatial aggregation layer, a temporal aggregation layer, and a prediction layer. Among them, the spatial aggregation layer adopts a defense mechanism to robustly aggregate local trust, and the temporal aggregation layer applies an attention mechanism for effective learning of temporal patterns. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that TrustGuard outperforms state-of-the-art GNN-based trust evaluation models with respect to trust prediction across single-timeslot and multi-timeslot, even in the presence of attacks. In addition, TrustGuard can explain its evaluation results by visualizing both spatial and temporal views."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"21","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"4433-4450","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677e5742fdbe8372a5eca230","677e5742fdbe8372a5eca231","677e5742fdbe8372a5eca232","677e5742fdbe8372a5eca233","5e70922b878c28a047391011"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fed","mniswId":"7968","title":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","issn":"1545-5971","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"a553a765-14c0-4736-87bc-405fa2a6a182"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677e5742fdbe8372a5eca22f","year":"2024","volume":"21","number":"5","documentHash":"7fbe9ef7-e6e5-4f0d-a913-1040a5a71cc0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Dynamicity","explainability","graph neural network (GNN)","robustness","trust evaluation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655050358"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e467bfdbe8372a5e9ed08","name":"Zeshui","lastName":"Xu","documentHash":"e0938f0e-3df6-4835-a1d1-74e07a177821"},{"objectId":"677e467bfdbe8372a5e9ed07","name":"Mingjie","lastName":"Cai","documentHash":"4aa95f33-1636-444e-90c3-950ab176e4e3"},{"objectId":"677e467bfdbe8372a5e9ed06","name":"Zijian","lastName":"Zheng","documentHash":"1da182ad-d0c7-44a0-b468-d578d8260f4f"},{"objectId":"677e467bfdbe8372a5e9ed05","name":"Bin","lastName":"Yu","documentHash":"aac354d9-11f4-4ea3-bbc6-86ae605b5f0d"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"677e467bfdbe8372a5e9ed04","doi":"10.1109/tfuzz.2024.3397808","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521784","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"CBCG: A Clustering Algorithm Based on Bidirectional Conical Information Granularity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this article, we propose a novel center-based clustering algorithm based on bidirectional conical information granularity. The main purpose is to fully absorb the semantic information of the ordinal relationship between objects to improve the performance of central clustering in identifying interleaved and imbalanced data. The proposed algorithm includes two main stages: first, the stage of determining the cluster center and second, the division stage. In the stage of determining the cluster center, the first cluster center is determined by using the number of conical information granularity in the data, and the remaining cluster centers are determined by defining the statistical measure of “fuzzy importance degree.” In the division stage, we divide the points to be clustered into stable and active areas. The former quickly and accurately identifies and assigns the objects belonging to a cluster by measuring the fuzzy similarity between the objects to be clustered and the cluster center, and the latter assigns the objects in the active area by using the information of the points already assigned. This method describes the position and sorting relationship of objects that are granulated through ordinal relationships more accurately in the global environment, thereby gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the structural characteristics of the data. This helps to improve the accuracy and stability of clustering algorithms in handling interleaved and imbalanced data. This article uses three clustering validity indicators to test the performance of our algorithm. We compare the results with those of six different types of popular clustering algorithms and new algorithms proposed in recent years. The experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this article can identify clusters more accurately on the datasets with a complex and staggered distribution. It is significantly better than the clustering algorithm participating in the comparison and has good robustness on datasets with added noise."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"4388-4400","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677e467bfdbe8372a5e9ed05","677e467bfdbe8372a5e9ed06","677e467bfdbe8372a5e9ed07","5e70922b878c28a047391011","677e467bfdbe8372a5e9ed08"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ff6","mniswId":"7978","title":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issn":"1063-6706","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2707d48e-bd2d-4094-8688-dbcf61c20fb1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677d4c25fdbe833088b1d534","year":"2024","volume":"32","number":"8","documentHash":"747a038e-8d2c-4193-9afa-1a9310eaf028"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bidirectional conical information granularity","$k$ -bidirectional conical information granularity","center-based clustering","fuzzy importance degree (FID)","two-step division"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655050366"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677fedb6fdbe831a91d97577","name":"Guoping","lastName":"Jiang","documentHash":"78fcd6ac-1357-4f48-9c69-36f6b2aea0c4"},{"objectId":"677fedb6fdbe831a91d97576","name":"Min","lastName":"Xiao","documentHash":"65a67e98-a88e-4f7c-a44b-c5b521a30ae6"},{"objectId":"677fedb6fdbe831a91d97575","name":"Xia","lastName":"Huang","documentHash":"c68f3428-0b53-419a-8ed4-9d0a728b6c3d"},{"objectId":"677fedb6fdbe831a91d97574","name":"Yi","lastName":"Yao","documentHash":"68da94fa-3055-4173-9a83-ec9fd3109fcc"},{"objectId":"677fedb6fdbe831a91d97573","name":"Yuanshan","lastName":"Lu","documentHash":"741f4e79-6a88-4b3b-a68f-c48a7f7533a4"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e75e","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"A56F3A8C2F6246587B88982FE48FEA2855A7B5222539A126265F1D882510368FD87B8932975E7451D01686982B7D3158DA885EF3F5FFA39E4B9D9EE6FD22470F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6960-9525","documentHash":"715a0529-c457-4823-a66d-ee6bebb7dd83"}],"objectId":"677fedb6fdbe831a91d97571","doi":"10.1142/s0218127424502031","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218127424502031","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Investigation of Spatial Pattern in SI Model with PD Control and Cross-Diffusion","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Spatial patterns are an important characteristic of ecological epidemic reaction–diffusion models, as they help predict the spatial dynamics of epidemic spread. However, there is currently a significant shortage in research on control strategies for generating and regulating these patterns. In this paper, we establish a Susceptible–Infectious (SI) model with Proportional-Derivative (PD) control and cross-diffusion. We analyze the stability of the model without diffusion and provide the conditions for Turing instability driven by diffusion. Using the cross-diffusion coefficient as the bifurcation parameter, we derive the amplitude equation of the two-dimensional Turing pattern at the Turing bifurcation threshold based on the multiple scale method, which determines the selection and stability of pattern formation. Numerical simulations in two-dimensional space show that the bifurcation parameter varies with changes in control parameters, and the PD control not only effectively alters the structure of Turing patterns but also suppresses Turing instability. Furthermore, it is found that more complex spatial patterns in three-dimensional space emerge under PD control."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"34","issue":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-15","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677fedb6fdbe831a91d97573","677fedb6fdbe831a91d97574","677fedb6fdbe831a91d97575","677fedb6fdbe831a91d97576","677fedb6fdbe831a91d97577","5e709200878c28a04738e75e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478185","mniswId":"8657","title":"International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos in Applied Sciences and Engineering","issn":"0218-1274","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"bbc5f68b-1939-473b-9350-03a722a2ccb9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677fedb6fdbe831a91d97572","year":"2024","volume":"34","number":"16","documentHash":"3227dd26-a3db-4e17-8fe3-0b1129927553"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SI model","cross-diffusion","Turing instability","bifurcation","pattern","PD control"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655050372"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677d4c25fdbe833088b1d538","name":"Weihua","lastName":"Cao","documentHash":"185f9c45-69cd-4020-92e7-3a469892bdd6"},{"objectId":"677d4c25fdbe833088b1d537","name":"Min","lastName":"Wu","documentHash":"fe30161f-da68-42ad-80e1-d75fad167d71"},{"objectId":"677d4c25fdbe833088b1d536","name":"Xian","lastName":"Ma","documentHash":"fb708c6a-2ab7-48cd-b420-9791882a5fa4"},{"objectId":"677d4c25fdbe833088b1d535","name":"Sheng","lastName":"Du","documentHash":"f35eaa8e-da20-45de-8730-2dd5b5789d84"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391011","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","uuid":"46608F8F43408649AF0559FEE81D6F1212BAD0D0B0A29EC12C98BB379C16848685A815BFF32F7E5D9E72027BD78E027AEDE2B94F79A95ADFB6AAEA4D777F1C2E","documentHash":"623154e3-ca70-4663-941e-c09800501d6c"}],"objectId":"677d4c25fdbe833088b1d533","doi":"10.1109/tfuzz.2024.3404853","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538420","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Time Series Anomaly Detection via Rectangular Information Granulation for Sintering Process","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Time series anomaly in the sintering process is a direct manifestation of equipment failure and abnormal operating mode, and effective detection of time series anomaly is important to improve the stability of the sintering process.

A two-phase design of rule-based model is offered in this study to provide a good alternative to cope with high dimensional data. We first build a standard decision tree on the basis of variables in order to discover homogeneous subsets of the data. Subsequently, a collection of fuzzy rules is induced by the decision tree with the aim of reflecting the underlying phenomenon. The calculation of membership degrees and the refinement of fuzzy rules on the basis of data located in each partition exhibit a substantial level of originality and innovation. The introduction of fuzziness into decision rules helps to characterize and quantify the continuous change of output values near the boundary areas. The constructed fuzzy rules could efficiently handle the ambiguity and vagueness in the experimental evidence and offer an accurate characterization of the nonlinearities of the input–output relationships. The developed fuzzy models could achieve much higher prediction accuracy in comparison with traditional decision trees of the same size and fuzzy rule-based models with the same number of rules. Another advantage of the proposed methodology comes with the evident readability of the formed fuzzy rules. A series of experiments is reported to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture of fuzzy rule-based models over traditional fuzzy rule-based models and decision trees."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047391011"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"2976-2986","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677e5a0efdbe8372a5ececde","677e5a0efdbe8372a5ececdf","677e5a0efdbe8372a5ecece0","5e70922b878c28a047391011","677e5a0efdbe8372a5ecece1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ff6","mniswId":"7978","title":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","issn":"1063-6706","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2707d48e-bd2d-4094-8688-dbcf61c20fb1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66eaf1bafdbe836650b22464","year":"2024","volume":"32","number":"5","documentHash":"8e172f06-16cf-4831-93b3-ee6c33e8a3c2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Correlation","decision tree","fuzzy rule-based model","partial distance strategy","regression"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655050576"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c176c7fdbe831c672e7f78","name":"Yu.

Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI technology has been widely applied in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) device control, including smart healthcare, smart homes, and robotics, and has achieved significant results. However, as the field of BCI-based IoT device control is still in its development stage, there remains considerable room for improvement in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost. Therefore, enhancing the classification accuracy of SSVEP decoding using a short time window, reducing both human and material costs, and improving work efficiency are crucial for the theoretical research and engineering applications of BCI technology in IoT device control. Based on this, we propose a novel approach to address the challenge of high-accuracy feature extraction within brief timeframes. Our approach integrates a multiscale convolutional neural network with a squeeze excitation module (SEMSCNN). This fusion leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs)’ local feature learning capacity and the advantageous feature importance distinction offered by the squeeze excitation mechanism. First, the electroencephalogram signals are band-pass filtered into distinct frequency bands and frequency band and channel features are extracted by a two-layer convolution. Then, temporal features are extracted via a multibranch convolution of different scales. Finally, the squeeze and excitation (SE) module is introduced to learn the interdependence between features to improve the quality of the extracted features. The first stage of training exploits statistical commonalities across research participants by learning the global model, and the second stage fine-tunes each participant’s features separately by exploiting participant-specific differences in features. We evaluate our SEMSCNN model on two large public datasets, Benchmark and BETA, and we compare our model to other state-of-the-art models in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed network. Our experimental results indicate that our method effectively improves the accuracy of target recognition and information transfer rate under short-duration stimuli, showing a significant advantage compared to other baseline methods. This provides a broad prospect for the practical application of BCIs in the field of IoT."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709273878c28a047395e6d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"5822-5833","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67e12370fdbe833fcf555873","67e12370fdbe833fcf555874","67e12370fdbe833fcf555875","67e12370fdbe833fcf555876","67e12370fdbe833fcf555877","67e12370fdbe833fcf555878","5e709273878c28a047395e6d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c327","mniswId":"7900","title":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","issn":"2327-4662","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"83cc7d56-ddb9-4546-ad50-11eb4ad05d3e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67e12370fdbe833fcf555872","year":"2025","volume":"12","number":"5","documentHash":"ca4732ec-85f2-4f24-b8c6-75fdfb4668ac"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Multiscale fusion","convolutional neural network (CNN)","squeeze and excitation module (SEM)","Brain–computer interface (BCI)","steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655061671"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67f3a0a0fdbe8303cfefd7b8","name":"Carlos E.","lastName":"Palau","documentHash":"92d8c545-b3b2-4f11-b07a-4fb39277cb37"},{"objectId":"67f3a0a0fdbe8303cfefd7b6","name":"Florian","lastName":"Gramß","documentHash":"82cb0875-d1d8-4bd0-9512-c110da5761e5"},{"objectId":"67f3a0a0fdbe8303cfefd7b5","name":"Renzo","lastName":"Bazan","documentHash":"35ad198d-5d5f-4a85-a47a-fe16b272a7aa"},{"objectId":"67f3a0a0fdbe8303cfefd7b4","name":"Korbinian","lastName":"Pfab","documentHash":"7a52d513-fdae-4996-8e17-a8886dd7f2ff"},{"objectId":"67f3a0a0fdbe8303cfefd7b3","name":"José","lastName":"Fontalvo-Hernández","documentHash":"2ee82318-a866-4ef6-85e4-7fdbc370d2dc"},{"objectId":"67f3a0a0fdbe8303cfefd7b2","name":"Philippe","lastName":"Buschmann","documentHash":"e2abafae-d69c-468c-8b5b-6aa7c17cee90"},{"objectId":"67f3a0a0fdbe8303cfefd7b1","name":"Raúl","lastName":"S-Julián","documentHash":"07786404-5bd5-425f-af51-a05d66d0e273"},{"objectId":"67f3a0a0fdbe8303cfefd7b0","name":"Rafael","lastName":"Vaño","documentHash":"2d805a81-cbb2-4e75-86a0-8fe8a0b324eb"},{"objectId":"67f3a0a0fdbe8303cfefd7af","name":"Andreu","lastName":"Belsa","documentHash":"88095009-0739-4184-a93b-03f73066cb09"},{"objectId":"67f3a0a0fdbe8303cfefd7ae","name":"Salvador","lastName":"Cuñat","documentHash":"383e3a16-a73e-4dbe-a045-fa91525dfb19"},{"objectId":"67f3a0a0fdbe8303cfefd7ad","name":"Ignacio","lastName":"Lacalle","documentHash":"2e531a0d-07e9-4927-9bb9-63fcb3e2c9c6"},{"objectId":"5e709460878c28a0473bbbb2","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wasielewska-Michniewska","uuid":"7AC38E766400919F5105968D58CBEACEC4CA05765138568D6854E0AC9D6E612DBC361D82892AC468833F6AAC7F34A0FA87AFF8EBFC6DC459D2C51E5CE37E9333","documentHash":"650618eb-edb9-4d99-bd37-453b9670bf3f"}],"objectId":"67f3a095fdbe8303cfefd737","doi":"10.1109/wf-iot58464.2023.10539408","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10539408","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"A Novel Approach to Self-* Capabilities in IoT Industrial Automation Computing Continuum","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Industrial automation is characterized by combining informational and operational technologies in an efficient manner to adapt to new production trends.

The AVVP task generally follows weakly supervised learning settings, since only video-level labels are provided. Most existing works usually generate modalitywise pseudo labels (PLs) first and then learn to parse audio or visual events from the audible videos. However, this paradigm inevitably results in two defects: 1) the generated PLs for each modality are not fully reliable, which may confuse models if they are adopted as supervision signals for discriminating modalities; and 2) the absence of temporal annotations increases the ambiguities in localizing foregrounds in videos, furtherly causing models prone to being disturbed by noisy labels. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel AVVP framework termed noise-resistant event parsing (NREP), which introduces evidential deep learning (EDL) to overcome the limitations of noisy pseudo supervision. Specifically, our NREP framework consists of three key components: 1) modalitywise evidential learning (MEL) that discriminates the modality-class dependency; 2) temporalwise evidential learning (TEL) that explores meaningful foregrounds; and 3) foreground–background consistency learning (FBCL) for collaborating two evidential learning branches above. Through perceiving meaningful video content and learning evidence for modality dependencies, our method suppresses the disturbance of noise in generated PLs thus achieving remarkable performance with different PL generation strategies. We evaluate our NREP method on two AVVP benchmark datasets and demonstrate it consistently to establish new state-of-the-art.

Grounded in established research methodologies, the study integrates perspectives from Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0.\nFindings\nThe presented BPM maturity assessment (BPM MA) is targeted at showing the actions that lead to raising BPM maturity by drawing upon the potential of the organization in a way which is harmonious with methodologies of implementing and using BPM. It focuses on practical usability and, thanks to this, eliminates one of the most often discussed flaws of BPM MMs.\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe limitation of this study is, at this stage, the lack of empirical verification and the lack of postulated BPM MA tools, integrated with the BPM software available on the market. Though the proposed BPM MA offers a systematic approach, targeted at practical use, it will, however, in the further perspective, require tailoring to the specific nature of different sectors of the economy in order to reach its full potential by, e.g. adapting the evaluation surveys and adding dedicated recommendations.\nPractical implications\nPractitioners may reap the benefits of the presented BPM MA thanks to its harmonization with methodologies of implementing BPM and the possibility of its use as an element of the standard BPM lifecycle. Accounting for the requirements of Industry 4.0/5.0 in both assessment criteria and recommendations provides managers support in the rapidly changing business environment.\nOriginality/value\nThe originality of this study rests in the synthesis of theoretical and methodological rigor with a singular focus on the practical usability of the proposed BPM MA. Apart from conceptual progress, the contribution of this study rests in removing the theoretical-practical gap and accounting for the requirements of Industry 4.0 and the upcoming Industry 5.0."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e70945c878c28a0473bb65e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479d05","mniswId":"3011","title":"Business Process Management Journal","issn":"1463-7154","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"9c4e0515-6012-4773-8691-b122e35baf5f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68239c26fdbe834501698a50","year":"2024","documentHash":"a388a426-d964-4860-931c-fe2d27d214ae"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Business process management (BPM)","Maturity","BPM maturity","Maturity assessment (MA)","Maturity model (MM)","Implementation methodology","Artificial intelligence (AI)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655096027"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68239529fdbe834501692c82","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Radziszewski","documentHash":"ad99276b-3a7c-4029-9f13-5a4dab1377e1"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde28","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Szelągowski","uuid":"27F74A4788BFD3CE18AFEB15DDFD6AF68BFD26DF42B08C891FC5799E5B821C30B1F9540493266D7BECFDE07FFF614A4D3046CB12C2036C95DBF88BD8E077B779","orcidId":"0000-0002-5114-6793","documentHash":"e3659fe9-4b80-4538-b542-c25ae66f4639"},{"objectId":"5e709213878c28a04738f7fb","name":"JANUSZ","lastName":"NESTERAK","uuid":"1B4A4D55DDD55F79BDFBCA212DC77B49A16D8794A57ABDF5258EF50401D466B2C9C0FA5977AB10B6FCDF54B173E8FB8D2E245F450309A17F501FDD06674BB028","orcidId":"0000-0001-9114-4947","documentHash":"7e1b62f2-65aa-4cab-b3a4-47e647452fe3"}],"objectId":"68239529fdbe834501692c80","doi":"10.1007/s10845-024-02419-x","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10845-024-02419-x","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Workplace performance measurement: digitalization of work observation and analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Process improvement initiatives require access to frequently updated and good quality data. This is an extremely difficult task in the area of production processes, where the lack of a process digital footprint is a very big challenge. To solve this problem, the authors of this article designed, implemented, and verified the results of a new work measurement method. The Workplace Performance Measurement (WPM) method is focused not only on the measurement of task duration and frequency, but also on searching for potential anomalies and their reasons. The WPM method collects a wide range of workspace parameters, including workers' activities, workers' physiological parameters, and tool usage. An application of Process Mining and Machine Learning solutions has allowed us to not only significantly increase the quality of analysis (compared to analog work sampling methods), but also to implement an automated controlling solution. The genuine value of the WPM is attested to by the achieved results, like increased efficiency of production processes, better visibility of process flow, or delivery of input data to MES solutions. MES systems require good quality, frequently updated information, and this is the role played by the WPM, which can provide this type of data for Master Data as well as for Production Orders. The presented authorial WPM method reduces the gap in available scholarship and practical solutions, enabling the collection of reliable data on the actual flow of business processes without their disruption, relevant for i.a. advanced systems using AI."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"36","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"3569–3585","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709213878c28a04738f7fb","5e709479878c28a0473bde28","68239529fdbe834501692c82"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454787c9","mniswId":"11500","title":"Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing","issn":"0956-5515","eissn":"1572-8145","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"29aebe73-3a78-4eaf-8211-450438593606"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68306f90fdbe8312e61dec22","year":"2025","volume":"36","number":"5","doi":"","documentHash":"d64294f5-fe23-4454-8bff-87ed9c2c726e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Workplace Performance Measurement (WPM)","Business process management (BPM)","Process mining","Machine learning (ML)","Artificial intelligence (AI)","Industry 4.0"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039399703"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"683037aafdbe8312e61ab19c","name":"Markus","lastName":"Stumptner","documentHash":"392e0f5c-e684-4772-afae-fa439cb920c3"},{"objectId":"683037aafdbe8312e61ab19b","name":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Mayer","documentHash":"902cc6ab-d2a8-46e7-a4a6-a907320f6fdb"},{"objectId":"683037aafdbe8312e61ab19a","name":"Zehong","lastName":"Cao","documentHash":"79898596-2833-42d9-96da-beb608561f70"},{"objectId":"683037aafdbe8312e61ab199","name":"Bin","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"a67583c5-db5b-418d-b1ac-111cc0f0cd5f"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b824f","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"C34B5BD166A72CFDCC0BB81F0FDB001A2EDE06564A6A420DB551E449F90B32FE4A6FB188EDBECD9DF6A835B4137D2D211C3B8ED329F77D14EF31C15B1A21C073","documentHash":"08e43a2c-24f1-478e-8cb2-5570dec5908f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2025},"objectId":"683037aafdbe8312e61ab197","doi":"10.1016/j.neunet.2025.107318","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2025.107318","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"HCPI-HRL: Human Causal Perception and Inference-driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The dependency on extensive expert knowledge for defining subgoals in hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) restricts the training efficiency and adaptability of HRL agents in complex, dynamic environments. Inspired by human-guided causal discovery skills, we proposed a novel method, Human Causal Perception and Inference-driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HCPI-HRL), designed to infer diverse, effective subgoal structures as intrinsic rewards and incorporate critical objects from dynamic environmental states using stable causal relationships. The HCPI-HRL method is supposed to guide an agent’s exploration direction and promote the reuse of learned subgoal structures across different tasks. Our designed HCPI-HRL comprises two levels: the top level operates as a meta controller, assigning subgoals discovered based on human-driven causal critical object perception and causal structure inference; the bottom level employs the Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm to accomplish the assigned subgoals. Experiments conducted across discrete and continuous control environments demonstrated that HCPI-HRL outperforms benchmark methods such as hierarchical and adjacency PPO in terms of training efficiency, exploration capability, and transferability. Our research extends the potential of HRL methods incorporating human-guided causal modelling to infer the effective relationships across subgoals, enhancing the agent’s capability to learn efficient policies in dynamic environments with sparse reward signals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709434878c28a0473b824f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"187","pagesFromTo":"1-13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["683037aafdbe8312e61ab199","683037aafdbe8312e61ab19a","683037aafdbe8312e61ab19b","683037aafdbe8312e61ab19c","5e709434878c28a0473b824f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478fc3","mniswId":"14920","title":"Neural Networks","issn":"0893-6080","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"a60d2885-cb0e-471f-b3ba-2cd5dd21056b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"683037aafdbe8312e61ab198","year":"2025","volume":"187","documentHash":"8cc8f80b-1fe8-45e8-a1ab-df70f31d1ae5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Deep reinforcement learning","Hierarchical reinforcement learning","Causal inference","Subgoal discovery"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039401596"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68304f37fdbe8312e61c2277","name":"Tan","lastName":"Yixin","documentHash":"fea4b1dd-cda0-49e8-b8a2-2df6801c7cdd"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396dab","name":"Jan","lastName":"Sokołowski","uuid":"D86F76C962EA4F52C42EC0E2867AFE870286266A7B8FACAAA324F869A573E8589798B0DD2700B73686277707B16BBD81D2D84C00FEE9C0AA49AAB989F7376D7A","documentHash":"8831a331-385f-4d75-bf78-45626a80b1b0"}],"objectId":"68304f37fdbe8312e61c2275","doi":"10.1007/s40687-025-00518-6","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40687-025-00518-6","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Shape and topology optimization of control problems in elasticity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We consider the shape and topology optimization for steady-state linear elasticity.

Most current studies choose filter cut-frequencies based on experience or intuition, resulting in sub-optimal use of MI-related spectral information in the electroencephalography (EEG). To improve information utilization, we propose a SincNet-based hybrid neural network (SHNN) for MI-based BCIs. First, raw EEG is segmented into different time windows and mapped into the CSP feature space. Then, SincNets are used as filter bank band-pass filters to automatically filter the data. Next, we used squeeze-and-excitation modules to learn a sparse representation of the filtered data. The resulting sparse data were fed into convolutional neural networks to learn deep feature representations. Finally, these deep features were fed into a gated recurrent unit module to seek sequential relations, and a fully connected layer was used for classification. We used the BCI competition IV datasets 2a and 2b to verify the effectiveness of our SHNN method. The mean classification accuracies (kappa values) of our SHNN method are 0.7426 (0.6648) on dataset 2a and 0.8349 (0.6697) on dataset 2b, respectively. The statistical test results demonstrate that our SHNN can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods on these datasets."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709273878c28a047395e6d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","pagesFromTo":"540-549","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63cbeb044097070d6acb13b6","63cbeb044097070d6acb13b7","63cbeb044097070d6acb13b8","63cbeb044097070d6acb13b9","63cbeb044097070d6acb13ba","63cbeb044097070d6acb13bb","63cbeb044097070d6acb13bc","5e709273878c28a047395e6d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547800d","mniswId":"8003","title":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","issn":"1534-4320","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"1e1c866b-d3e0-4542-829f-c77e7a13a947"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63cbeb044097070d6acb13b5","year":"2022","volume":"30","documentHash":"d83d6eda-5358-4f7c-8ece-58af585ab41b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Brain-computer interface","motor imagery","SincNet","neural network","gated recurrent unit"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748386605225"}]
