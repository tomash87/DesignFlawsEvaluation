The 8–14 h oat fermentation with both L. plantarum strains, but not with L. casei LcY, led to obtaining products with stronger antioxidant properties. Forty-four volatile compounds were detected in fermented oat samples with aldehydes as the major group of molecules, followed by alcohols, ketones, and acids. In the case of L. plantarum W42, the highest content and number of volatiles was formed after 12 h of fermentation, while L. plantarum IB and L. casei LcY needed 20 h to this end. Generally, the composition and concentration of volatile compounds of fermented oat were strain-dependent.

Thirty volatiles were identified in raw material, with β-linalool, methyleugenol, methylcinnamate, and estragole predominating. Meanwhile, 24 and 18 volatiles were detected in the oven- and microwave-dried samples, with a significant decrease of methyleugenol content. The highest radical scavenging ability and total phenolic content were achieved for microwaved wastes using photochemiluminescence, DPPH, and Folin-Ciocalteu test. Moreover, 8 phenolic acids and 9 flavonoids were identified in the LC-MS/MS analysis, with significant contents of rosmarinic acid and luteolin (1042.45 and 11.68 µg/g of dry matter, respectively) in the microwaved basil.

The neuropeptide phoenixin (PNX) and its receptor (GPR173) are potential key factors involved in the proliferative and inflammatory regulation of the reproductive system in females. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of PNX and GPR173 by qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence assays in the endometrium of bitches suffering from CEH or pyometra compared to clinically healthy females. Additionally, PNX and progesterone (P4) plasma concentrations were analysed. The results showed a significantly lower expression levels of PNX and GPR173 (mRNA and protein production) in bitches with the CEH or pyometra groups compared to healthy animals. Immunofluorescence staining examination also confirmed a lower concentration of PNX and GPR173 signals in bitches with pathological uteri. Moreover, a lower concentration of PNX blood levels in bitches suffering from pyometra was observed. The PNX concentration was negatively correlated with P4 but only in healthy bitches. These results illustrate that the development of canine uterine disorders may cause a lower expression of PNX and its receptor GPR173."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d2d","5e7094c0878c28a0473c316c","5e709409878c28a0473b53f7","5e7094df878c28a0473c5b0e","5e709409878c28a0473b5377","62120f912467f077c36ab383","5e7093e2878c28a0473b28cb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","uid":"b4-9zzGvUfyUhirAhWcr-QA","uuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","name":"Instytut Chemii Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e2878c28a0473b28dc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","parentUuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","rootUuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb73"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"238","pagesFromTo":"art. no 106931 (1-13)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709409878c28a0473b5377","5e7093e2878c28a0473b28cb","5e709409878c28a0473b53f7","62120f912467f077c36ab383","5e7094df878c28a0473c5b0e","5e7094c0878c28a0473c316c","62120f912467f077c36ab387","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb73","5e709342878c28a0473a5d2d","5e7093e2878c28a0473b28dc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477038","mniswId":"1150","title":"Animal Reproduction Science","issn":"0378-4320","eissn":"1873-2232","documentHash":"84aa4a1b-995d-49c9-b83a-db66bf4dee35"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62120f912467f077c36ab38b","year":"2022","volume":"238","documentHash":"f8de0107-51fb-4bde-ae7e-5be92c9815b1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Canine","Uterine diseases","Phoenixin","GPR173 receptor"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058067790"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c1215","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Korytko","uuid":"F1AF57A9B8C7ECA89E4592BD0201EC0F358093283F779D97153948BF133194F95AA6CDF18E0A0B32093DCA763E24946EFD5D3D3229755AB90F402BA89F6925DF","documentHash":"e2bd373e-811a-42f2-a981-ce3accadfb96"},{"objectId":"5e7093f9878c28a0473b4351","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Gospodarska","uuid":"ADE53B04548F53A76A9F00AE1504117B006113706FA000B237A8EFB22FE6C75B981D0779DDB0D6F23754136961DD2954BAC20C133E8CD6510DC3FD5D9CBBDD30","documentHash":"b6337b53-1ea3-4a8a-8111-e1d4416b384a"},{"objectId":"5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c0e","name":"Julia","lastName":"Jarosławska-Miszkiewicz","uuid":"18C41BF13C62E3811D508951BA29C0BF46C71F2F3ED332E67E03A98C40B6C43613B3BDF890E63EE19A740E970B0563C6EE7706FB19448F4E3CF03587B3EA0A6A","documentHash":"3aed2fd6-2183-47df-94d4-d3949c65ecd1"}],"objectId":"6281f6374097077bd40137f6","doi":"10.1111/jne.13095","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jne.13095","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Increasing energy expenditure through exercise and low ambient temperature offers oxidative protection to the hypothalamus after high‐fat feeding to mice","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The effects of weight loss produced by increased energy expenditure on measures of oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage have not been investigated in the hypothalamus of diet-induced obese mice. The present study aimed to characterize the effects of either a low housing temperature of 17°C or daily exercise on a treadmill on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced abnormalities in the hypothalamic tissue of mice. Exercise and low ambient temperature protocols were designed to produce energy deficit through increased energy expenditure. Forty mice aged 8 weeks were assigned to one of four conditions: chow diet (n = 10), HFD (n = 10), HFD and 5 weeks of either exercise training (ET; n = 10) or an ambient temperature of 17°C (n = 10). Mice were killed at the age of 31 weeks. In comparison with HFD treatment alone, both interventions reduced body adiposity (14.6% and 27.6% reduction for the ET and 17°C groups, respectively). Moreover, exposing obese mice to ET and 17°C restored mitochondrial DNA content (41.3% and 32.6% increase for the ET and 17°C groups, respectively), decreased level of lipid peroxidation as assessed by the detection of 4-hydroxy-nonenal protein adducts (12.8% and 29.4% reduction for the ET and 17°C groups, respectively) and normalized the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines (Tnfα: 73.9% and 62%; Il1β: 54.5% and 39.6%; Il6: 33.1% and 35.6% reduction for the ET and 17°C groups, respectively), as well as several proteins associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain (OxPhos Complex I: 75.7% and 53.9%; Complex III: 33% and 36%; Complex V: 42% and 36.9% reduction for the ET and 17°C groups, respectively) in hypothalamic cells. Negative energy balance induced through either lower ambient temperature or exercise resulted in substantial and similar improvements in markers of inflammation and mitochondrial damage in the hypothalamus of mice with diet-induced obesity, potentially by reducing oxidative stress."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c1215"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f9878c28a0473b4351","5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c0e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"34","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"art. no e13095 (1-15)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c0e","5e7093f9878c28a0473b4351","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1215"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788df","mniswId":"11985","title":"Journal of Neuroendocrinology","issn":"0953-8194","eissn":"1365-2826","documentHash":"2885ef9d-4caa-4e36-bc79-c87723c008a4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6281f7924097077bd4013d0a","year":"2022","volume":"34","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"61d4cb3c-d990-4eae-9e67-6c8186644c0d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058114303"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9106","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Starowicz","uuid":"4B013299B3042105F83161B8FEC8C2AFE99A43C0731E4233A861F9527288289333FD7AF50660B70486E0E2F9EAA01C3F56B7B36075573598CE5AD9EED841EF89","documentHash":"1dffe897-4b02-48b2-836f-24fe503b9548"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b7ed","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Sawicki","uuid":"7B314B9AC13AFC7C61E6A416F0C14D500C21F9030C2422D97D0B269A4D9A87EDEF36FD6E251F8DEC1E701E6A16D64C8C7ED423418F2685650BF0D034CB926E87","orcidId":"0000-0002-4304-1625","documentHash":"6c1fcf62-a564-4554-b9e3-aba587ba6728"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a80e","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Hanus","uuid":"3FDDA9475C67444781CD084AB6B87120BF91FB2D8A33347AB07F36C62900F78F003B64AF6E3785B949CF380D248AA23270F647028894DB2A439D9FE62648CAE6","orcidId":"0000-0002-5859-9023","documentHash":"101a6285-ac31-4414-b4ac-dd5a307d0424"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fd7a","name":"Lucyna","lastName":"Kłębukowska","uuid":"3F66D62C06BA7B6493D38474E5C742C780DB2334FA56A9F6AF887171FA07F3968155518768F9E0292AEC4046C080582E80F93BE7A3374B06C0E3AB446382416E","orcidId":"0000-0002-0444-1132","documentHash":"b232af88-8dae-4c21-850b-0b480cd20700"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"621e200d2467f06798e27b01","doi":"10.3390/molecules27041301","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/4/1301/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Profile of Polyphenolic Compounds, Contents of Total Phenolics and Flavonoids, and Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Properties of Bee Products","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed to characterize bee products (bee bread, bee pollen, beeswax, and multiflorous honey) with the profile of phenolic compounds, total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid (TFC) contents, and antioxidant and microbiological properties.

Sinapic acid dominated in bee pollen, gallic acid in the bee bread and honey, while pinobanksin was the major compound of beeswax. The data showed that bee pollen and bee bread had a stronger antioxidant potential than honey and beeswax. Moreover, the antibacterial activity of the bee products was studied using 14 bacterial strains. Bee bread’s and bee pollen’s antimicrobial activity was higher towards Gram-negative strains. In comparison, honey was more potent in inhibiting Gram-positive bacteria.

The limited molecular and biochemical mechanistic studies outlining the antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anticancer, antimicrobial, neuroprotective and antidiabetic activities of guava seeds available in the literature are also extensively discussed in this review. The use of guava seed constituents as food additives and food functional and structural modulators, primarily as fat reducers, emulsifiers, water and oil holding agents, is also conceptually explained.

Seeds of 2 pea varieties, a colored-flowered variety and a white-flowered variety (CFP and WFP, respectively) were fed to 56-d-old birds for 8 wk. A total of 539 female Hybrid turkeys were allocated to 7 groups, each group consisted of 7 pens with 11 birds per pen. The experiment had a 2-factorial design, with 3 dietary inclusion levels of PS (100, 200 and 300 g/kg) and 2 pea varieties (CFP and WFP). The control group (diets without PS) was compared with CFP and WFP treatments by simple contrast analysis. In comparison with CFP seeds, WFP seeds contained 7-fold less tannins (0.67 vs. 4.66 g/kg) and less non-starch polysaccharides (NSP, 117.8 vs. 132.7 g/kg), but more trypsin inhibitors (1.34 vs. 0.98 g/kg) and starch (489 vs. 455 g/kg). A rise in the PS content of diets from 100 to 200 and 300 g/kg increased the weight of the small intestine (P = 0.031) and the dry matter (DM) content of intestinal digesta (P = 0.001), but it had no effect on the pH of digesta. Only the highest PS content differentiated the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the small intestinal digesta (WFP > CFP, P = 0.008), whereas PS did not cause any changes in the morphological parameters of the small intestinal mucosa. The dietary inclusion of PS had no influence on the levels of acetate, butyrate, putrefactive SCFAs or total SCFAs in the cecal contents. Apart from increasing the activities of β-glucosidase (P = 0.017) and β-galactosidase (P = 0.025), pea varieties did not affect the activities of the analyzed cecal microbial enzymes. However, CFP seeds decreased the DM content (P = 0.041) and increased the pH of cecal digesta, compared with WFP seeds (P = 0.013). The results of this study, pointing to a few differences in the functional parameters of the small intestine and cecum, indicate that tannins are not a factor differentiating the suitability of CFP and WFP seeds in the nutrition of finisher turkeys. The inclusion of PS at 200 and 300 g/kg of the diet reduces the content of SBM and wheat in turkey diets, which has a positive effect on gastrointestinal function."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fc69","5e709217878c28a04738fc66"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a41","5e709410878c28a0473b59eb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"167-177","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a41","5e709217878c28a04738fc66","5e709217878c28a04738fc69","62a8407b40970742eed5142b","5e709410878c28a0473b59eb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b977","mniswId":"1146","title":"Animal Nutrition","issn":"2405-6383","eissn":"2405-6545","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"27a65099-7864-425e-ab66-5e41b4ca1f4a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058135138"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6283949040970702b886865d","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Błażejewski","documentHash":"42aebdcf-1aef-4657-a39e-4e4e146aefe3"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Judycka","uuid":"1BC4BF9E119F09531BF37A15CAB0B8930B3CEAD1AF40343466114BF77590C3D83197AC72C68511FBF2141C1C8BA5A439D9C46314ACF0CF765BCFB4F5151DB784","documentHash":"4562af07-7167-4f8c-8263-56fca5431f8e"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11da","name":"Halina","lastName":"Karol","uuid":"B56AE0FEC4329B4A533A0AFF80224BF560FF08C07F32148710FDF9E2B5436A567D151768453CB6ADB03B18BE0B22A5040280E9328A23E0DB4C9604193E38188A","documentHash":"1d238f64-b7bd-405c-9b3a-1cb28a0aa957"},{"objectId":"5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Żarski","uuid":"C79A8111D2D012910483FF5D04C579E9FE114BBBFDBA5CB7C07AD1BEF561D1BD73734995AC49C0CF23B9AA29ACAE919DB99FD8CDFA546404CB973C5E79C1ADB2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3082-9250","documentHash":"720051ea-3868-48ad-9aab-29755a850bd5"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a40","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Dietrich","uuid":"343890A86A171B3CF4DCC212604012207FA15F466B2B3EEEBDAE98B7B968A0A8F2EEF12CAE341C02833944BA387F7935D3E116CFE3F911843DFADCD34BA15BD2","documentHash":"93973a70-2b79-47b1-bb44-2c0b853a7a56"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Ciereszko","uuid":"8DDAA077AF44261DCF0520E5A544DC624790613E97D31A6E69866CA47B0BE48CA68261CB972862072612A15E8601DFB12A75BC79EB268AE20BF6FDE46BBDCFD3","documentHash":"4ffd62ff-6e05-41ff-9258-58db72ae7b17"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900a2","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Hliwa","uuid":"A9A46B8F6468A54F4207406082D5BDA772E2C53FD412E3FA3DDDE25B72B04915AF77AEE292B181630240A41FD656FB060836ED9E3B54A635B210757AA11E42E2","orcidId":"0000-0001-5205-608X","documentHash":"d26b0c4b-182b-4a12-a54c-36e076f083d8"}],"objectId":"6283949040970702b8868656","doi":"10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737790","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0044848621014538?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Toward commercialization: Improvement of a semen cryopreservation protocol for European perch enables its implementation for commercial-scale fertilization","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study emphasis improved semen cryopreservation protocol for commercial scale fertilization in European perch.

The supplementation of glucose-methanol extender with 25 mM KCl enabled high sperm motility (54%) up to 30 min post thawing, showing improvement compared to earlier studies performed on this species. Interestingly, an improved procedure allowed us to handle the semen prediluted in extender up to 30 min and this time period is prerequisite for freezing large volumes of semen at commercial scale. Further, assessment on efficiency of these post-thaw semen showed high fertilization rate for cryopreserved (77.6 ± 14.0) and fresh semen (78.0 ± 14.7; P > 0.05). Cryopreservation of semen performed with improved protocol enables to fertilize up to 237 g of eggs (~118,500 eggs) in a single application which is on commercial scale requirement. Thus, the improved protocol can be implemented to facilitate sustainable commercial scale fertilization toward selective breeding programs of European

survey of skin ulcers in Anguilla anguilla L. females during artificial maturation under controlled conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Controlled indoor reproduction of European eel is commonly recognized as a prospective tool to prevent extinction of this fish species. There is a little information about diversity of bacterial microflora of European eel during long maturation under controlled but changing thermal and salinity conditions. Characteristics of the composition of the bacterial microflora inhabiting the body surface of fish kept firstly in fresh and then in salt water, may help enhance the survival of spawners and spawning efficiency. Knowledge about the presence of potentially pathogenic bacterial species and their antibiotic resistance is particularly important. Methods: This study analyzed the bacterial microflora of two types of necrotic changes on the skin of eel females during artificial maturation under fresh and saltwater conditions. Results: A total of two hundred and forty bacterial strains were isolated from necrotic dermal changes on fish in freshwater and saltwater conditions. Both the bacterial number and biodiversity were greater in freshwater than in saltwater. Psychrophilic bacterial strains in freshwater were twice as abundant as in saltwater, especially among isolates which were cultured from the mucus or from ulcerative changes around the chip injection point (up to 1010 cfu/mL). 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of isolates from the freshwater conditions revealed the presence of twenty genera of bacteria, including: Pseudomonas sp., Comamonas sp., Escherichia sp., Aeromonas sp., Citrobacter sp., Burkholderia sp., Pantoea sp., Enterobacter sp., Yersinia sp., Edwardsiella sp., Serratia sp., Bordetella sp., Morganella sp. and Chromobacterium sp. In saltwater conditions, five genera of bacteria were found dominantly: Pseudomonas sp., Aeromonas sp., Yersinia sp., Vibrio sp., Edwardsiella sp. In freshwater conditions, the bacteria were mostly resistant or resistant to all tested antimicrobial drugs. Conclusions: Changes in bacterial microflora during controlled indoor reproduction of European eel predispose fish to bacterial infection especially during the first freshwater step of female maturation. New, alternative to antibiotic therapy, methods should be adopted to prevent infections and enhance spawning efficiency."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094d0878c28a0473c4680","5e70921c878c28a0473900a3","5e70921c878c28a0473900ac","5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90","5e709217878c28a04738fd78","5e7094b6878c28a0473c224b","5e70921c878c28a0473900b6","5e70921c878c28a0473900a5"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"art. no 101259 (1-8)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62e8e21e4097075a21d93135","5e70921c878c28a0473900ac","5e7094b6878c28a0473c224b","62e8e21e4097075a21d93138","5e70921c878c28a0473900b6","5e7094d0878c28a0473c4680","5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90","62e8e21e4097075a21d9313c","62e8e21e4097075a21d9313d","5e70921c878c28a0473900a5","62e8e21e4097075a21d9313f","5e709217878c28a04738fd78","62e8e21e4097075a21d93141","5e70921c878c28a0473900a3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d7a6","mniswId":"20992","title":"Aquaculture Reports","issn":"2352-5134","eissn":"2352-5134","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"99140b83-1678-4900-8f41-d6ce7d6e3541"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e8e21e4097075a21d93144","year":"2022","volume":"25","documentHash":"2641afac-c9da-47f9-9f7c-424889958258"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058162939"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70945e878c28a0473bb94d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Draszanowska","uuid":"D5E4DA4E2580E2F12ACADBE5972E820AE1DEC5332245E003384C6550AA9450E99DC081F290D37E086B258E8E2AD30091913CF55E6D3105AD7F082E484C6E7888","orcidId":"0000-0003-4928-4422","documentHash":"71de51d9-a70f-43a1-b480-a79c02902493"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9106","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Starowicz","uuid":"4B013299B3042105F83161B8FEC8C2AFE99A43C0731E4233A861F9527288289333FD7AF50660B70486E0E2F9EAA01C3F56B7B36075573598CE5AD9EED841EF89","documentHash":"1dffe897-4b02-48b2-836f-24fe503b9548"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af8c2","name":"Marta","lastName":"Czarnowska-Kujawska","uuid":"685FB8FECD970D3C7B542F59E54FB3150D3E10E8BC54B9857468D55B1EB5C91026CD171C9185723B3FF108A8253EAEAB1FB336360FE3139E093D80F4D0AF661E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1547-2409","documentHash":"8e912a84-10c7-4722-a055-398c3a992e0b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"62f0d29440970731f3eadc7b","doi":"10.1016/j.lwt.2022.113825","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0023643822007605?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of different cooking methods on the folate content, organoleptic and functional properties of broccoli and spinach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The effect of boiling, steaming, microwaving, cooking in a combi oven and using the sous-vide method under tested thermal conditions on the various properties of broccoli and spinach was evaluated.

Moreover, for folates, sous-vide cooking preserved these vitamer contents better than boiling for both vegetables but did not retain the green color of broccoli, as determined by C* (color saturation) and h° (hue angle). In broccoli samples, folate losses caused by sous-vide, microwave and cooking in a combi oven did not exceed 30%.

In the treated group, an increase of ERß mRNA expression was observed, while a decreased was found in untreated animals. There was increased PR, ERα and ß expression in endometrial tissue in treated cows, and decreased expression of these factors in untreated cows. In the treated group, recurrence of ovarian cyclicity was noted in 52% of animals and pregnancy was obtained in 34.8% of them, while in the untreated group, recurrence did not occur. In the control group, spontaneous recurrence of ovarian cyclicity was not observed. An increase of PR expression was correlated with increased proliferation of endometrial cells. Conclusions: It seems likely that the endometrium is well developed and ready for placentation after removing the exogenous source of progesterone and preventing the recurrence of cyclicity of ovaries."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"art. no 1235 (1-13)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923a878c28a047392104","62a179d14097070cd36ef8c1","62a179d14097070cd36ef8c2","62a179d14097070cd36ef8c3","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89","62a179d14097070cd36ef8c5","62a179d14097070cd36ef8c6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cow","intravaginal inserts","PR","ER","reproduction","insemination"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058175837"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62d132da4097075e7c7842a6","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Smagieł","documentHash":"fac1db82-fa66-4af6-b93f-421fd55a4ecf"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c1211","name":"Irena","lastName":"Godycka-Kłos","uuid":"D9510AF6BA5775BBA1A6684B9436E241208F11F50A90FACB4F45EEBCEFE745F1261EAD2CDB65685EB1C7D1693B32D83CDF4A9F5E26B8DA1855985F4B262E46E1","documentHash":"3b4e5b46-9284-4c98-8e81-c50c47c337a9"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59eb","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Juśkiewicz","uuid":"1644050D67ACD80B8BC27ADF8B38AD7DEAFE9E8BEFA53E0A8AF6EFE84AA8E8DEB184121515D6283EE52388411624DBC5FA5D10A17FD77F08CC13332E6FE84C49","documentHash":"8b9659f7-943c-408b-b92c-d518b23bb150"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a62","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Cholewińska","uuid":"098DFA63039D5DE7E3410556C89266096889CB92A09FBDB2367292ADEA637411E7A59D91610B0C6C4A34144C24EA33A1021E42BC4F4E6628CA890E569C71D0E9","orcidId":"0000-0003-0437-4766","documentHash":"bf9d24e8-0526-46a3-8e87-79793e6c66dd"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db85","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Fotschki","uuid":"B32913EBC04EBC974415B9A4AF172468FCE1E3D1895EE4A186FD90232032DF91AD4687F4133C7608047DC44FF22E84E568A06C9F679D8F3F7728BF9D2BADAB44","documentHash":"107b89cc-ea69-43a4-afb0-f819d7b423f4"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a04739097c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Listos","uuid":"BBB3CD882F8FAE28BA1E6725341B3DDA5BA7143717B32E6DEC57C8C65E606F28951F7B3FAC1E75724699BF3E504D3A5EC1BB89D79608277BBF36E6BF49A09F64","orcidId":"0000-0003-3289-9615","documentHash":"8350f2b9-7c82-496d-9af8-501ee0c44e64"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a047390128","name":"Michał","lastName":"Majewski","uuid":"97B1136ED6B457D8B20CC8BB001AC15DAC31D671B5ACFE0CAD6AFF2BE57A52B0DAF05C09D0925811923FBF9EA515FC240506954987FB86E4AF084EC46EB1A64C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6304-0673","documentHash":"641979e7-069c-4416-9611-d64ade21d1a2"},{"objectId":"5e7091f5878c28a04738dbcd","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Ognik","uuid":"FA09EA8CA723666E6ECFE2C4E500A63EB6018F2DD846EA61515B0F53B5E3CC0BDA42B17E6DAFFE19A7790F7B02EF4591BA28D86DCC70C4DDB83B8DA4A8FDBCF8","orcidId":"0000-0003-4393-4092","documentHash":"9a6d75b2-e3b5-4c13-9b6e-c1a5fc82d4a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62d132da4097075e7c78429c","doi":"10.3390/antiox11050910","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/11/5/910","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of copper nanoparticles in the diet of WKY and SHR rats on the redox profile and histology of the heart, liver, kidney, and small intestine","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this experiment was to test the effect of the partial or complete replacement of traditional CuCO3 in the diet of rats with copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) on the biochemical parameters, redox status, and histomorphometry of their tissues. Normotensive male Wistar–Kyoto rats (WKY) were allocated to three groups. Three analogous groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were also formed. The WKY and SHR rats received copper in a standard daily dose—6.5 mg/kg CuCO3 or CuNPs (100% replacement) or 3.25 mg/kg CuCO3 plus 3.25 mg/kg CuNPs (50% replacement)—for 8 weeks. Next, blood, heart, small intestine, liver, and kidney samples were collected. The activity of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase and the content of creatinine and urea acid were measured in the plasma. The collected tissues were subjected to a histological evaluation, and redox status parameters (catalase and superoxide dismutase activity, malondialdehyde and glutathione content) were determined. The replacement of CuCO3 with CuNPs in the diet may exacerbate the negative changes induced by hypertension in the heart, liver, and intestines. However, it seems that it is only in the case of the liver where the observed changes may be due to an increase in oxidative reactions resulting from the inclusion of CuNPs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091be878c28a0473873ea","uid":"bYQKxifulEuEJLcUdbBIzPA","uuid":"61768707-7dd1-4777-87bb-ee42bb9201f9","name":"Katedra Biochemii i Toksykologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a62","5e7091f5878c28a04738dbcd","62d132da4097075e7c7842a6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70921c878c28a047390128"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c1211","5e709410878c28a0473b59eb","5e7092d6878c28a04739db85"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"art. no 910 (1-18)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a62","5e7091f5878c28a04738dbcd","5e709224878c28a04739097c","5e709410878c28a0473b59eb","5e70921c878c28a047390128","62d132da4097075e7c7842a6","5e7092d6878c28a04739db85","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1211"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b9c0","mniswId":"1366","title":"Antioxidants","eissn":"2076-3921","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5ec622a7-7fa9-4218-a935-9f333c764c84"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"627a5b614097077f84efe4f0","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"5","documentHash":"413fd2d6-be69-4562-8500-11997d6d436b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058203929"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62da686240970752a1f0d088","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Gawrońska-Kozak","documentHash":"caac3594-5b93-4bad-b690-d2402fe323a4"},{"objectId":"62da686240970752a1f0d085","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Walendzik","orcidId":"0000-0001-8349-6387","documentHash":"f8769adb-0015-4ba2-917c-6477e01c0e0b"},{"objectId":"62da686240970752a1f0d084","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kopcewicz","documentHash":"b21d679c-dfca-417a-b46b-b758273ad04b"},{"objectId":"617a0b297523400564d4b4ac","name":"Magda","lastName":"Słyszewska","uuid":"168B57803C7866B91269C87D891C8EDCDB732E29152A8D7D97CE81BB42F0C1A5E3D42579761D333EEDCBC9F65F6394AE7876BAC4A1696086ED90B23F8BFBA2F7","documentHash":"688b8823-e874-493f-a592-b54b0b25d207"},{"objectId":"5ec4a0f27523407996eaea63","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Stałanowska","uuid":"0B275E1A778F64ED514BFC05DDDAD33097763574E3F54A0E6D6FA366FCA6DAA43B55CEF615B60DD46A820BC5A4D20C35309CAF7DA9FEACC3F5C36EA17386A9DA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8585-144X","documentHash":"d0adb082-3af1-4011-a154-2e357df1e039"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f8","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Wiśniewska","uuid":"9D6F71DDA590B62A4AB94114A5BDE14E1748B11F9F622FCC01E350F86E2B17F96714C9CCFB7861429F0DFEC9FFF8D3DF037A8319F0AE104D06AF9D3E80ADC716","documentHash":"3ad42612-1bf4-4302-bcea-c5a233c4a946"},{"objectId":"5e7093e1878c28a0473b27f7","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Machcińska-Zielińska","uuid":"B6DA8465E3ECA561D094C70FDBC567FC7A96BF8AF5C86A58C40122BC641D1C9DE35DFC2D0993032944C5924F8526158A94743FA637A1CFFE86F865DD6381EB56","documentHash":"aa4ac6e4-5a85-4f8d-8184-2cd5ec8c9ae2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"62da686240970752a1f0d080","doi":"10.1016/j.yexcr.2022.113263","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0014482722002567?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Comparative studies on the effect of pig adipose-derived stem cells (pASCs) preconditioned with hypoxia or normoxia on skin wound healing in mice","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) from human and animal fat have emerged as therapeutic alternatives for damaged tissues. Pre-conditioning of ASCs with hypoxia results in their functional enhancement, which might facilitate the process of healing. However, there is still a critical need for large-scale preclinical studies to reinforce the translation of these findings into clinical practice for humans and in veterinary medicine. Here, we adapted a full-thickness excisional skin wound mouse model to evaluate and compare the effect of pig adipose-derived stem cells (pASCs) cultured under normoxia (pASCs-Nor) or hypoxia (pASCs-Hyp) on the healing process. We show that pASCs-Hyp accelerated re-epithelialization, increased hyaluronic acid (HA) content, and decreased scar elevation index (SEI) during the late stage of healing (day 21). Transplantation of pASCs-Hyp also promoted expression of angiogenic marker VegfA and decreased levels of pro-scarring Tgfβ1. Mice tolerated xenotransplantation of the pASCs with no impact on macrophage (CD68 -positive cell) content. However, wounds treated with pASCs-Hyp exhibited decreased elasticity at the early stage of healing and increased expression of Wnt signaling members including Wnt10a, Wnt11, and β-catenin, which are associated with scar-forming wound repair. In conclusion, pASCs treatment may provide a critical step toward the evaluation of pASCs as therapeutically relevant cells in the context of wound healing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62da686240970752a1f0d084","5e7093e1878c28a0473b27f7","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f8","617a0b297523400564d4b4ac","62da686240970752a1f0d088","62da686240970752a1f0d085"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ec4a0f27523407996eaea63"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"418","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"art. no 113263 (1-15)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f8","617a0b297523400564d4b4ac","62da686240970752a1f0d084","62da686240970752a1f0d085","5e7093e1878c28a0473b27f7","5ec4a0f27523407996eaea63","62da686240970752a1f0d088"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c5f","mniswId":"6414","title":"Experimental Cell Research","issn":"0014-4827","eissn":"1090-2422","documentHash":"0b0b3ed9-ab22-41fd-be6e-85f1aa160a29"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62da686240970752a1f0d08a","year":"2022","volume":"418","number":"1","documentHash":"c591be4d-f979-4abb-b525-7deceb399e8c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058207055"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa1e6","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Jarocka-Cyrta","uuid":"F829F0F9CCA909A4D136E56D949FEECA50AA283BA94929B10407FA3845B1BE358924D2729F2B212F8AB4DD5736BD748173FAF7BA328076845A5D1F69D50815A0","orcidId":"0000-0002-0919-6615","documentHash":"a9b7157e-e2ee-4dd6-ad6c-9c1bef149abd"},{"objectId":"5e7092e3878c28a04739ecfc","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kocot","uuid":"8A611A662BD7AC3E81E30B722136E44E57C0A24580741F0771E083FCF84FB54185A8280762364F8AF7F12B616A7CA77C8D414F3739C820646EC224AEE9457751","orcidId":"0000-0003-0578-2673","documentHash":"a1013191-13c0-4fcc-a10d-7e418dc0e42d"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Drabińska","uuid":"BD8D7BBA04AB3002BD05F55A48A28169F93C36A25B27A9FD4C80B6F6D80302849707C6D419C6E7496425D334AD12A22D9BF153D0B6DAAECCEE5E1E1C38BBA56D","orcidId":"0000-0001-5324-5982","documentHash":"9463e3e0-a836-47ee-b9da-db8e791739ce"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":1,"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"6284a5ae40970712d1b3ecb3","doi":"10.3390/ijms23052896","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/5/2896/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Overview of the Importance of Biotics in Gut Barrier Integrity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Increased gut permeability is suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of a growing number of disorders. The altered intestinal barrier and the subsequent translocation of bacteria or bacterial products into the internal milieu of the human body induce the inflammatory state. Gut microbiota maintains intestinal epithelium integrity. Since dysbiosis contributes to increased gut permeability, the interventions that change the gut microbiota and correct dysbiosis are suggested to also restore intestinal barrier function. In this review, the current knowledge on the role of biotics (probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics and postbiotics) in maintaining the intestinal barrier function is summarized. The potential outcome of the results from in vitro and animal studies is presented, and the need for further well-designed randomized clinical trials is highlighted. Moreover, we indicate the need to understand the mechanisms by which biotics regulate the function of the intestinal barrier. This review is concluded with the future direction and requirement of studies involving biotics and gut barrier."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa1e6"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e3878c28a04739ecfc","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"art. no 2896 (1-32)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e3878c28a04739ecfc","5e709375878c28a0473aa1e6","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"af6a20fb-d2a4-4932-9316-c527c3bae159"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"622726342467f06c17648b0c","year":"2022","volume":"23","number":"5","doi":"","documentHash":"23f3046e-2709-4230-b100-cc3795aafd69"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058247591"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6295c34d4097072fefb798f5","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Sznajder-Katarzyńska","documentHash":"505d2b4f-f6cc-4c41-a88c-2faf4750e24e"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Wiczkowski","uuid":"A445B60E2C80F5319C08EF716E136CD876DC26A2A64B90215992326CEC3E88C747A494DD05BCE2A7CEB5F7E02C4FB6FA78E34EA5D616429F09576334B9B3ED03","documentHash":"5674033e-a108-4b65-93d8-84a69c4a35e7"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588a","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":"ACDF393EDD5617E052F030A01229E8428BB6016E08FDEE5C1E197E7D62E799573B6A7AEB725233560EB0788143DDD3D158DAC6D9162C1007A8B980A24A12C7D1","documentHash":"3517728d-3d41-4845-b4aa-3df0dd950582"},{"objectId":"5e709309878c28a0473a1975","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Surma","uuid":"FCD2CF6F084F3A9656BF5C07E07E63DC2A21BA8305B90772B14F56A335C23A6420781A42FCDFD4FFBB9597E5BCAA9E28F71C069F3115879CD6FB2304624DA8D2","orcidId":"0000-0001-8266-1619","documentHash":"b0b6afad-4421-44b5-b2bc-c8195718eeb4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"6295c34d4097072fefb798f2","doi":"10.3390/app12105242","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/10/5242/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Assessment of Bioactive Surfactant Levels in Selected Cereal Products","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are bioactive surfactants that are widespread in the environment and living organisms. This study presents measurements of PFAS in selected food of plant origin that are part of the healthy eating pyramid, including bread, rolls, flour, bran, buckwheat, millet, rice, and noodles. A simple and reliable analytical method was developed for the simultaneous determination of seven perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and three perfluoroalkane sulfonates (PFSAs) in cereal-based products. Out of the 10 PFASs, 5 PFASs were detected at levels above LOQ. The most frequently detected compound was perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which was quantified in 65.2% of samples, while none of the others were present in more than 40.0% of tested products. Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) was the predominant PFAS in cereal-based products, and its maximum measured concentration was 202.85 ng/g for wheat bran. The soil–root–shoot interactions in relation to PFAS transfer to the above-ground parts of plants and PFAS’s ability to interfere with proteins are most likely the sources of these compounds in commonly consumed cereal products. As PFBA contributes greatly to total PFAS concentration, this food group should be included in future dietary exposure assessments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e08d","uid":"b_2SL7EJHW_bpe-duzSevtA","uuid":"d9e45b87-1c29-437e-b310-49f8311d9171","name":"Wydział Technologii Żywności","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6295c34d4097072fefb798f5","5e709309878c28a0473a1975"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","5e70940d878c28a0473b588a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"art. no 5242 (1-15)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709309878c28a0473a1975","6295c34d4097072fefb798f5","5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","5e70940d878c28a0473b588a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"976d1e86-5dd0-4e19-9276-7114f4dea573"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)","micro-HPLC-MS/MS","QuEChERS","crops","cereal products","health risk"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261365"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588a","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":"ACDF393EDD5617E052F030A01229E8428BB6016E08FDEE5C1E197E7D62E799573B6A7AEB725233560EB0788143DDD3D158DAC6D9162C1007A8B980A24A12C7D1","documentHash":"3517728d-3d41-4845-b4aa-3df0dd950582"},{"objectId":"5e7093f7878c28a0473b41a3","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Piskuła","uuid":"4582BC226B489857AE957B3334CAEA991424FCCC587D91BFE93A97599A84F93E970C039AED805D1D20D9EF9FC624D24792101AC245E0D73F853CDB647157DCA1","documentHash":"bc4fa630-f9bf-4ed6-a0cb-2a1afff52c1d"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390f50","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Zielińska","uuid":"6AFAC63CF2521476F402FFDE8FFC31E7A9D4DC6E8E7F0888226502852BC564B4BBF7B32B84EE557B39C23FE4AD63FE2AB93A789B94584F13CFA311ACB809AA7F","orcidId":"0000-0001-7202-4018","documentHash":"54ffdac4-4c5b-4f6e-ae1a-a0448be2a676"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"634fa06140970779e45d173f","doi":"10.3390/antiox11081438","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/11/8/1438/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"An Electrochemical Determination of the Total Reducing Capacity of Wheat, Spelt, and Rye Breads","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The most interesting activities associated with bread components such as phenolic compounds, fibre, tocols, or newly formed compounds in the Maillard reaction, are their reducing properties responsible for the formation of the overall reducing capacity of bread.

In this study, the application of the CV assay for the determination of the total reducing capacity of flours, doughs, and breads as well as their crumbs and crusts, originated from wheat, spelt, and rye formulated on white flours (extraction rate of 70%) and dark flours (extraction rate of 100%) and baked at 200 °C for 35 min and at 240 °C for 30 min was addressed. The reducing capacity of hydrophilic extracts from white flours and breads as well as their crumbs and crusts showed double values when compared to that of lipophilic ones whilst hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts from dark breads and their parts revealed comparable levels. The dark wheat, spelt, and rye breads showed an approximately threefold higher total reducing capacity than white breads. Baking at higher temperature slightly increased the total reducing capacity of breads and the highest value was found for dark rye bread as well as its crust baked at 240 °C for 30 min. The cyclic voltammetry methodology showed to be especially suitable for screening the bread technology and allows for obtaining rapid electrochemical profiles of bread samples."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047390f50"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940d878c28a0473b588a","5e7093f7878c28a0473b41a3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"art. no 1438 (1-11)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a047390f50","5e70940d878c28a0473b588a","5e7093f7878c28a0473b41a3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b9c0","mniswId":"1366","title":"Antioxidants","issn":"2076-3921","eissn":"2076-3921","documentHash":"7901f3dc-def7-44a9-b732-047dbd3dcf82"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6308a174409707498f0c5d2a","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"8","documentHash":"5d880e8e-9988-4781-9758-cba1eb4f68f9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058275507"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Drabińska","uuid":"BD8D7BBA04AB3002BD05F55A48A28169F93C36A25B27A9FD4C80B6F6D80302849707C6D419C6E7496425D334AD12A22D9BF153D0B6DAAECCEE5E1E1C38BBA56D","orcidId":"0000-0001-5324-5982","documentHash":"9463e3e0-a836-47ee-b9da-db8e791739ce"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6364b3c94097070e8725c8bf","doi":"10.3390/separations9030081","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2297-8739/9/3/81/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Evaluation of Amino Acid Profiles in Gluten-Free Mini Sponge Cakes Fortified with Broccoli By-Product","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Many gluten-free products are deficient in amino acids, especially in essential amino acids (EAA). Therefore, the incorporation of additives rich in free amino acids (FAA) into gluten-free products can be a promising strategy to alleviate certain symptoms of celiac disease associated with EAA deficiencies. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the incorporation of broccoli leaf powder (BLP) into gluten-free mini sponge cakes (GFS) on the profile of FFA. BLP replaced an equivalent amount (2.5%, 5%, 7.5%; w/w) of corn and potato starches in GFS formulation, resulting in B1-B3 formulations. The first step was the selection of the most efficient method for extraction of FAA. Extraction based on 50% methanol (method 1) was compared to extraction by 25% of acetonitrile in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (method 2). In total, 26 and 14 FAA were found in BLP after extraction using methods 1 and 2, respectively. Moreover, considering the total content of FAA, method 1 was more efficient, reaching a 14-fold higher concentration of FFA in BLP compared to method 2. The incorporation of BLP resulted in a significant increase in FAA, irrespective of the applied extraction method. The total concentrations of NEAA and EAA increased significantly in B3 compared to control GFS. In summary, this study showed that 50% methanol was more efficient for the extraction of FFA from plant and bakery matrices. Moreover, BLP was found as a good source of FFA, including EAA, and the obtained experimental GFS could be considered a promising product for individuals on a gluten-free diet."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej

Here, we subjected chickens to dysbiosis via C. perfringens infection or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment and investigated the potential link between meat VOCs and cecal bacterial activity and the ameliorative effect of CBD. The cecal bacterial production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was closely correlated with meat VOCs. CBD supplementation reduced the formation of breast meat spoilage VOCs, including alcohols, trimethylamine and pentanoic acid, in the challenged birds, partly by decreasing cecal putrefactive SCFA production. Meat VOC/cecal SCFA relationships differed according to the challenge, and CBD attenuated the effects of C. perfringens infection better than the effects of LPS challenge on meat VOCs. These findings provide new insights into the interactions among bioactive agent supplementation, gut microbiota activity and meat properties in birds"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b59eb","5e7092d6878c28a04739db85"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea4","uid":"bdue8IYFHJjfPMqPlXSYxbA","uuid":"30312732-6777-4ca9-84e6-ad3f07bc18c2","name":"Instytut Fizjologii i Żywienia Zwierząt im.

LncRNAs are considered an important factor in the regulation of countless biological processes, mainly through the regulation of gene expression and interactions with proteins. However, the detailed mechanism of interaction as well as functions of lncRNAs are still unclear and therefore constitute a serious research challenge. In this study, for the first time, potential mechanisms of lncRNA regulation of processes related to sperm motility in turkey were investigated and described. Customized bioinformatics analysis was used to detect and identify lncRNAs, and their correlations with differentially expressed genes and proteins were also investigated. Results revealed the expression of 863 new/unknown lncRNAs in ductus deferens, testes and epididymis of turkeys. Moreover, potential relationships of the lncRNAs with the coding mRNAs and their products were identified in turkey reproductive tissues. The results obtained from the OMICS study may be useful in describing and characterizing the way that lncRNAs regulate genes and proteins as well as signaling pathways related to sperm motility."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709429878c28a0473b7643","5e7093e1878c28a0473b2809","5e70921c878c28a04739011c","5e709217878c28a04738fc28","5e709217878c28a04738fc58","5e70945e878c28a0473bb8bb"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a04739828d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb02","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"art. no 7642 (1-22)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709217878c28a04738fc28","5e709429878c28a0473b7643","5e70921c878c28a04739011c","5e7093e1878c28a0473b2809","5e70945e878c28a0473bb8bb","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f8","5e709292878c28a04739828d","5e709217878c28a04738fc58","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb02"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cd58924097073c6e2f6dbd","year":"2022","volume":"23","number":"14","documentHash":"69378368-6241-475d-8ce1-efff44b85168"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["lncRNA","RNA-seq","NGS","DEL","gene expression;","sperm motility","transcriptomics","turkey"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058305086"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63871d8140970727ca79f240","name":"Jessica","lastName":"Shin","documentHash":"6a33f8d1-9d4f-4ac9-84f3-448a6adc1b0e"},{"objectId":"63871d8140970727ca79f23f","name":"Monika","lastName":"Ruszkowska","documentHash":"fb3a7cb2-dc00-46e8-b3e3-89b22f379bce"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9106","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Starowicz","uuid":"4B013299B3042105F83161B8FEC8C2AFE99A43C0731E4233A861F9527288289333FD7AF50660B70486E0E2F9EAA01C3F56B7B36075573598CE5AD9EED841EF89","documentHash":"1dffe897-4b02-48b2-836f-24fe503b9548"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b7ed","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Sawicki","uuid":"7B314B9AC13AFC7C61E6A416F0C14D500C21F9030C2422D97D0B269A4D9A87EDEF36FD6E251F8DEC1E701E6A16D64C8C7ED423418F2685650BF0D034CB926E87","orcidId":"0000-0002-4304-1625","documentHash":"6c1fcf62-a564-4554-b9e3-aba587ba6728"}],"objectId":"63871d8140970727ca79f23e","doi":"10.1007/s00217-022-04041-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00217-022-04041-8.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Free and conjugated phenolic compounds profile and antioxidant activities of honeybee products of polish origin","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, the profile of free and conjugated phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of bee bread, bee pollen, honey and beeswax samples from the same beehive was analyzed. The contents of free phenolic compounds and those released from the esters and glycosides bounds were analyzed by HPLC–TOF–MS/MS method. In the obtained extracts, the total of phenolic (TP) and flavonoid (TF) contents was measured using spectrophotometric methods, while antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH and ABTS in vitro assays. Therefore, in the tested honeybee products 23 phenolic compounds were identified, constituting of 14 phenolic acids and nine flavonoids. Among the phenolic acids, ferulic (bee bread), protocatechuic (bee pollen) and m-coumaric acids (honey and beeswax) were predominant. In case of flavonoids, the major compounds were vitexin in bee bread, orientin in bee pollen, and apigenin in honey. The highest TP and TF contents were detected in the bee pollen, and was 4.11 mg GAE/g and 0.41 mg Q/g, respectively. Moreover, these compounds were mostly present in bound form. Honeybee product extracts had high scavenging ability against radicals, and their antioxidant activity differed significantly across samples (p < 0.05). Overall, this study demonstrates that selected honeybee products are an abundant source of the bioactive compounds with the characteristic profile of phenolic compound as well as antioxidant activity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b9878c28a04739b7ed","63871d8140970727ca79f23f"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709442878c28a0473b9106"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"248","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"2263-2273","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b9878c28a04739b7ed","63871d8140970727ca79f23f","63871d8140970727ca79f240","5e709442878c28a0473b9106"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b80","mniswId":"6113","title":"European Food Research and Technology","issn":"1438-2377","eissn":"1438-2385","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"cddb95ac-37f4-41a8-a08e-65d7401cfccc"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058317878"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59eb","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Juśkiewicz","uuid":"1644050D67ACD80B8BC27ADF8B38AD7DEAFE9E8BEFA53E0A8AF6EFE84AA8E8DEB184121515D6283EE52388411624DBC5FA5D10A17FD77F08CC13332E6FE84C49","documentHash":"8b9659f7-943c-408b-b92c-d518b23bb150"},{"objectId":"5e7093c6878c28a0473b0980","name":"Anna","lastName":"Stępniowska","uuid":"20B97CF551353409DDDB390F14EF99535022CCF3B9867EC979D4B5CD2FEC03C90E484AD3FA96D590080F65350B4D2869B5926E5FB809C162ED208DDF8226B7E5","orcidId":"0000-0003-2424-8935","documentHash":"f160d32b-278f-4b64-84fa-4798fa78d909"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390ec1","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Tutaj","uuid":"2339AB5B9483C1257705E9E87E0108B87957BA925AF4AFE3F0F153259B81D901DF331E3D799880035586E1D00CEB65E134CA2C935251F0E0FD1C67312FFA7D0D","orcidId":"0000-0002-3742-3715","documentHash":"373a82f1-8232-4380-b1cf-ec247790c206"},{"objectId":"5e7091f5878c28a04738dbcd","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Ognik","uuid":"FA09EA8CA723666E6ECFE2C4E500A63EB6018F2DD846EA61515B0F53B5E3CC0BDA42B17E6DAFFE19A7790F7B02EF4591BA28D86DCC70C4DDB83B8DA4A8FDBCF8","orcidId":"0000-0003-4393-4092","documentHash":"9a6d75b2-e3b5-4c13-9b6e-c1a5fc82d4a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-09-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62d7d8f34097075e7c009b7c","doi":"10.1007/s40618-021-01677-3","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40618-021-01677-3","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of a high-fat diet and chromium on hormones level and Cr retention in rats","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"AIMS: The aim of the study was to determine how the administration of a high-fat diet supplemented with various forms of chromium to rats affects accumulation of this element in the tissues and levels of leptin, ghrelin, insulin, glucagon, serotonin, noradrenaline and histamine, as well as selected mineral elements. METHODS: The experiment was conducted on 56 male Wistar rats, which were divided into 8 experimental groups. The rats received standard diet or high fat diet (HFD) with addition of 0.3 mg/kg body weight of chromium(III) picolinate (Cr-Pic), chromium(III)-methioninate (Cr-Met), or chromium nanoparticles (Cr-NP). RESULTS: Chromium in organic forms was found to be better retained in the body of rats than Cr in nanoparticles form. However, Cr-Pic was the only form that increased the insulin level, which indicates its beneficial effect on carbohydrate metabolism. In blood plasma of rats fed a high-fat diet noted an increased level of serotonin and a reduced level of noradrenaline. The addition of Cr to the diet, irrespective of its form, also increased the serotonin level, which should be considered a beneficial effect. Rats fed a high-fat diet had an unfavourable reduction in the plasma concentrations of Ca, P, Mg and Zn. The reduction of P in the plasma induced by supplementation with Cr in the form of Cr-Pic or Cr-NP may exacerbate the adverse effect of a high-fat diet on the level of this element. CONCLUSION: A high-fat diet was shown to negatively affect the level of hormones regulating carbohydrate metabolism (increasing leptin levels and decreasing levels of ghrelin and insulin)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091be878c28a0473873ea","uid":"bYQKxifulEuEJLcUdbBIzPA","uuid":"61768707-7dd1-4777-87bb-ee42bb9201f9","name":"Katedra Biochemii i Toksykologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c6878c28a0473b0980","5e70922b878c28a047390ec1","5e7091f5878c28a04738dbcd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b59eb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"45","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"527-535","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a047390ec1","5e7091f5878c28a04738dbcd","5e7093c6878c28a0473b0980","5e709410878c28a0473b59eb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478667","mniswId":"10933","title":"Journal of Endocrinological Investigation","issn":"0391-4097","eissn":"1720-8386","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"8f12cee5-8807-497f-bad1-9c12777a2828"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058318119"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa1e6","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Jarocka-Cyrta","uuid":"F829F0F9CCA909A4D136E56D949FEECA50AA283BA94929B10407FA3845B1BE358924D2729F2B212F8AB4DD5736BD748173FAF7BA328076845A5D1F69D50815A0","orcidId":"0000-0002-0919-6615","documentHash":"a9b7157e-e2ee-4dd6-ad6c-9c1bef149abd"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Drabińska","uuid":"BD8D7BBA04AB3002BD05F55A48A28169F93C36A25B27A9FD4C80B6F6D80302849707C6D419C6E7496425D334AD12A22D9BF153D0B6DAAECCEE5E1E1C38BBA56D","orcidId":"0000-0001-5324-5982","documentHash":"9463e3e0-a836-47ee-b9da-db8e791739ce"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"638f1c7d409707404481ff32","doi":"10.3390/ijms232315279","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/23/15279/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Crosstalk between Resveratrol and Gut Barrier: A Review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The plant-based nutraceuticals are receiving increasing interest in recent time. The high attraction to the phytochemicals is associated with their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, which can lead to reduced risk of the development of cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases. One of the most disseminated groups of plant bioactives are phenolic compounds. It was recently hypothesized that phenolic compounds can have the ability to improve the functioning of the gut barrier. The available studies showed that one of the polyphenols, resveratrol, has great potential to improve the integrity of the gut barrier. Very promising results have been obtained with in vitro and animal models. Still, more clinical trials must be performed to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on the gut barrier, especially in individuals with increased intestinal permeability. Moreover, the interplay between phenolic compounds, intestinal microbiota and gut barrier should be carefully evaluated in the future. Therefore, this review offers an overview of the current knowledge about the interaction between polyphenols with a special emphasis on resveratrol and the gut barrier, summarizes the available methods to evaluate the intestinal permeability, discusses the current research gaps and proposes the directions for future studies in this research area."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa1e6"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"art. no 15279 (1-17)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2","5e709375878c28a0473aa1e6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6384739340970732086c26b4","year":"2022","volume":"23","number":"23","documentHash":"44b1dee3-77bc-4dae-9d8c-ed7adc3af6f9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058328273"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6388e45f4097074ca3220152","name":"Mariana","lastName":"Nogueira","documentHash":"15061e34-c169-411d-9160-81e62346c9d6"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a9b","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ciska","uuid":"65A9CA80E9BDF6331A5D168E2CF04E02A9BC6815213C620DEFDC7DF5E80CE3B5A76DB76BDF74E0C0E9302786D6FAC808FEFD4FEA6EE6D63F6C04B304B592077A","documentHash":"40425552-13af-4463-877a-455939e508ff"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62e7","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Jeleń","uuid":"0F40FC56651B437BA73983A4623DC31C59374C01043F57747A92AA71F800860BE84F272D5466006821479AD28842A174809745F77C7939C8FA5816A596D39121","orcidId":"0000-0002-6568-8155","documentHash":"547ff3b0-47e1-45d0-b3c8-f4489a935bff"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Drabińska","uuid":"BD8D7BBA04AB3002BD05F55A48A28169F93C36A25B27A9FD4C80B6F6D80302849707C6D419C6E7496425D334AD12A22D9BF153D0B6DAAECCEE5E1E1C38BBA56D","orcidId":"0000-0001-5324-5982","documentHash":"9463e3e0-a836-47ee-b9da-db8e791739ce"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-07-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6388e45f4097074ca3220151","doi":"10.31883/pjfns/152070","publicUri":"http://journal.pan.olsztyn.pl/pdf-152070-77241","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of Drying and Broccoli Leaves Incorporation on the Nutritional Quality of Durum Wheat Pasta","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Pasta is a great vehicle for the incorporation of vegetable-derived ingredients to increase the consumption of the health-beneficial components originating from vegetables. Notably, by-products of vegetable processing can also serve as a rich source of phytochemicals. An important step in pasta processing is drying which can affect the content of bioactive compounds in pasta. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of drying on the nutritional quality and cooking properties of durum wheat pasta fortified with broccoli leaves. Pasta enriched with broccoli leaf powder (BLP) at 2.5% (B2.5) and 5% (B5), and control pasta without BLP (C), which differed in drying conditions: fresh pasta without drying (F), pasta dried at 50oC for 8 h (L), and pasta dried at 80oC for 3 h (H) were formulated. The obtained pasta products were analysed for the cooking properties (optimal cooking time, cooking loss, water absorption and swelling capacity); colour parameters; proximate composition; and contents of free amino acids (FAA), fatty acids and sugars. BLP significantly improved the contents of ash by up to 35 g/100 g, FAA and fatty acids to up to 1298 nmol/g dry matter (DM) and 16741 µg/g DM, respectively, without compromising the cooking quality of pasta. Drying had a significant effect on fatty acids, which content in pasta processed at the highest temperature tested decreased. From the nutritional point of view, the low-temperature drying seems to be an interesting method for pasta preparation, with the highest content of FAA, fatty acids, especially unsaturated ones, and the lowest content of sugar. However, at the same time, the dried pasta products were characterised by greater cooking loss approximating 10%."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709346878c28a0473a62e7","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a9b","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"72","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"273-285","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2","6388e45f4097074ca3220152","5e709410878c28a0473b5a9b","5e709346878c28a0473a62e7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479301","mniswId":"16299","title":"Polish Journal of Food and Nutrition Sciences","issn":"1230-0322","eissn":"2083-6007","documentHash":"4c570dfd-3e86-41dd-a8a0-27ceb7e163b0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"636e96bb4097073d46c62f4c","year":"2022","volume":"72","number":"3","documentHash":"cf832b72-debf-4495-9fbd-2a3e80493c77"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058339615"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63adb2bf4097070d11c2ab02","name":"Bahram","lastName":"Falahatkar","documentHash":"b15a29fc-f744-4b00-96c4-39d91bdb036a"},{"objectId":"63adb2bf4097070d11c2ab01","name":"Erfan Akbari","lastName":"Nargesi","documentHash":"94897e26-87fe-4a8b-9c2e-78df0e537e4b"},{"objectId":"5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Żarski","uuid":"C79A8111D2D012910483FF5D04C579E9FE114BBBFDBA5CB7C07AD1BEF561D1BD73734995AC49C0CF23B9AA29ACAE919DB99FD8CDFA546404CB973C5E79C1ADB2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3082-9250","documentHash":"720051ea-3868-48ad-9aab-29755a850bd5"}],"objectId":"63adb2bf4097070d11c2ab00","doi":"10.1016/j.anireprosci.2022.106932","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85124382108&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Artificial reproduction of Caspian roach, Rutilus caspicus following stimulating ovulation with Ovaprim, Ovopel, and their combinations under controlled conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of different hormonal agents and their combinations for spawning induction of females Caspian roach, Rutilus caspicus.

The results showed that no fish ovulated in the control group. In hormone-treated groups, no differences were observed in ovulation success (P > 0.05). The shortest latency time and highest working and relative fecundities were observed in fish stimulated with two injections of Ovaprim (T1 group). The mean values of fertilization success in treated fish were in the range of 87.9–93.1% and the highest values were observed in T3 and T1 groups (P < 0.05). The best results in terms of ovulation index (92.1%), hatching rate (93.7%), and survival up to the eyed egg stage (89.4%) were achieved after administering two injections of Ovaprim (T1 group).

Estrogens have been proven to be the crucial hormones driving the growth of adenomyosis. Little is known about the distinct mechanisms of progesterone action in adenomyosis. Hence, in this study, we decided to characterize the expression of all nuclear and membrane estrogen and progesterone receptors. Additionally, as a functional investigation, we monitored prolactin production and cell proliferation after estradiol and progesterone treatments. We confirmed the presence of all nuclear and membrane estrogen and progesterone receptors in adenomyotic lesions at gene and protein levels. The expression of membrane progesterone receptors α and β (mPRα, mPRβ) as well as estrogen receptor β (ERβ) was upregulated in adenomyosis compared to normal myometrium. Estradiol significantly increased adenomyotic cell proliferation. Progesterone and cAMP upregulated prolactin secretion in adenomyosis in the same pattern as in the normal endometrium. In the present study, we showed the functional link between estradiol action and adenomyotic cell proliferation, as well as progesterone and prolactin production. Our findings provide novel insights into the sex steroid receptor expression pattern and potential regulated pathways in adenomyosis, suggesting that all receptors play an important role in adenomyosis pathophysiology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa22d","5e7092ac878c28a04739a659","63ad92714097070d11c08791","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f3","5e70922d878c28a04739129c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"15","pagesFromTo":"art. no 4407 (1-16)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922d878c28a04739129c","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7","63ad92714097070d11c08791","63ad92714097070d11c08792","5e7092ac878c28a04739a659","63ad92714097070d11c08793","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f3","5e709375878c28a0473aa22d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","eissn":"2077-0383","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm","documentHash":"dd8b920e-6e74-4566-b0cf-d3ec7b7d448a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058371386"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ada1214097070d11c13b72","name":"Rana M.","lastName":"Aadil","documentHash":"ad452197-a68e-442e-af74-4597eccfd764"},{"objectId":"63ada1214097070d11c13b71","name":"Muhammad F.","lastName":"Manzoor","documentHash":"8a325414-402d-43e2-b4e6-6a6f9aa55d01"},{"objectId":"63ada1214097070d11c13b70","name":"Noman","lastName":"Walayat","documentHash":"ce527012-5224-4de4-a2d9-d38f06c0e532"},{"objectId":"63ada1214097070d11c13b6f","name":"Ishtiaq","lastName":"Ahmad","documentHash":"e5744ea6-5ab6-4e4e-ba05-9919defd6ffd"},{"objectId":"63ada1214097070d11c13b6e","name":"Asad","lastName":"Nawaz","documentHash":"66bc4333-992e-4d2a-97ce-1287311fc481"},{"objectId":"63ada1214097070d11c13b6d","name":"Gulden","lastName":"Goksen","documentHash":"514aa02d-5114-4312-84e9-d50a4cdc05a8"},{"objectId":"63ada1214097070d11c13b6c","name":"Brera G.","lastName":"Nabi","documentHash":"e268e6e4-114e-48fc-99b6-45d613eac596"},{"objectId":"63ada1214097070d11c13b6b","name":"Kinza","lastName":"Mukhtar","documentHash":"8b2f494c-1aaf-4341-b081-95a3d26a3416"},{"objectId":"63ada1214097070d11c13b6a","name":"Mehwish","lastName":"Arshad","documentHash":"ef4be610-9556-4d81-a303-7a3996ffa5f5"},{"objectId":"63ada1214097070d11c13b69","name":"Muhammad U.","lastName":"Shahbaz","documentHash":"4476c53c-4253-44ed-be38-28154837f126"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9106","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Starowicz","uuid":"4B013299B3042105F83161B8FEC8C2AFE99A43C0731E4233A861F9527288289333FD7AF50660B70486E0E2F9EAA01C3F56B7B36075573598CE5AD9EED841EF89","documentHash":"1dffe897-4b02-48b2-836f-24fe503b9548"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ada1214097070d11c13b68","doi":"10.3390/molecules27165152","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85136663311&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Natural plant extracts: An update about novel spraying as an alternative of chemical pesticides to extend the postharvest shelf life of fruits and vegetables","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fresh fruits and vegetables, being the source of important vitamins, minerals, and other plant chemicals, are of boundless importance these days. Although in agriculture, the green revolution was a milestone, it was accompanied by the intensive utilization of chemical pesticides. However, chemical pesticides have hazardous effects on human health and the environment. Therefore, increasingly stimulating toward more eco-friendly and safer alternatives to prevent postharvest losses and lead to improving the shelf life of fresh fruits and vegetables. Proposed alternatives, natural plant extracts, are very promising due to their high efficacy. The plant-based extract is from a natural source and has no or few health concerns. Many researchers have elaborated on the harmful effects of synthetic chemicals on human life. People are now much more aware of safety and health concerns than ever before. In the present review, we discussed the latest research on natural alternatives for chemical synthetic pesticides. Considering that the use of plant-based extracts from aloe vera, lemongrass, or neem is non-chemical by-products of the fruits and vegetable industry, they are proved safe for human health and may be integrated with economic strategies. Such natural plant extracts can be a good alternative to chemical pesticides and preservatives."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709442878c28a0473b9106"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"art. no 5152 (1-19)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ada1214097070d11c13b69","63ada1214097070d11c13b6a","63ada1214097070d11c13b6b","63ada1214097070d11c13b6c","63ada1214097070d11c13b6d","5e709442878c28a0473b9106","63ada1214097070d11c13b6e","63ada1214097070d11c13b6f","63ada1214097070d11c13b70","63ada1214097070d11c13b71","63ada1214097070d11c13b72"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","documentHash":"8615ffac-9999-41cd-9658-bd5ed633cde5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058371398"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5faa9659085dcb5a2b98d905","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Płatosz","uuid":"5636E30C22C78CF694F4C1F874B2E790B3A5DA6A6A7D86F3BC011852423C7D816C6B80371ACF1FB9C80B5D8B4DFF539900D9DB4AE5465D0A1C2701B3AA4E3FE4","documentHash":"77905b10-f1c1-4e7c-8985-adca2d4dad61"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c120d","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Topolska","uuid":"ED6AEEFCDF3A4A51A3789757280F1B4D91423E0BA13FF3748DC4FBDE22EAABE1C03CEAD624CB15F181F2B1E8B29F7D411DFEC79E86C3E5B3A88E64B48FCE620C","documentHash":"3526422f-ff33-422e-8e18-07c5f27a6cc0"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c120c","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Bączek","uuid":"637E16C1658EDFF062FD7C045372ED2816EBDD7665FA8106FA0D3290461451C92D6BF340D799162F07D2D9C19F7C79E2F27CD587C62DA06813892B0301C39A2D","documentHash":"aa402877-5138-43d9-970c-b4d98ce24fe0"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Wiczkowski","uuid":"A445B60E2C80F5319C08EF716E136CD876DC26A2A64B90215992326CEC3E88C747A494DD05BCE2A7CEB5F7E02C4FB6FA78E34EA5D616429F09576334B9B3ED03","documentHash":"5674033e-a108-4b65-93d8-84a69c4a35e7"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c25","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Szawara-Nowak","uuid":"B0BD2E293A5F29396A1B3C26F7CF06A1AF7F116A444CB00806BCC84D03C9337F9C81DF1004642415E197D4EEE378DC5D7D366F60A88301E6B0C2BBC16D3348F4","documentHash":"ea32c4ef-c83e-4530-be19-08fd152a473f"}],"objectId":"63adab6c4097070d11c22d09","doi":"10.1021/acs.jafc.2c03778","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85139403183&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier features different permeability to cyanidin-3-galactoside and cyanidin-3-diglucoside-5-glucoside and their metabolites circulating in blood","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Previous studies have demonstrated the penetration of anthocyanins through the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSF barrier) after intraruminal administration of chokeberry and red cabbage preparation to sheep.

Betalains are water-soluble nitrogenous natural pigments that are used as natural colorants in food industries, due to their applicability and their rich pharmacological profile including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties. Therefore, there is a need for a detailed exploration of betalains to fully exploit their properties. Opuntia spp. plants are one of the primary sources of betalains. The objective of this study was to identify betalain phytochemical content in prickly pear cactus of two different Opuntia species from Greece (an Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill (OFI) orange prickly pear cultivar and an Opuntia spp. purple prickly pear cultivar) using modern analytical techniques as also to evaluate their antioxidant and cytotoxicity profile. To achieve this we used an array of analytical techniques, including ultra-violet-vis (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) as also cell based in vitro assays. These enabled us to establish a rapid approach that can distinguish the different Opuntia spp. cultivars based on their phytochemical constituents through untargeted metabolomics analysis using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry - quadrupole time-of-flight (UPLC/MS Q-TOF). These findings could allow a further exploitation of Opuntia species and especially their enriched betalain phytochemical profile as viable source of natural food colorants."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7db9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"77","pagesFromTo":"198-205","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ad8b154097070d11bff36e","63ad8b154097070d11bff36f","63ad8b154097070d11bff370","63ad8b154097070d11bff371","63ad8b154097070d11bff372","63ad8b154097070d11bff373","63ad8b154097070d11bff374","5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","63ad8b154097070d11bff375","63ad8b154097070d11bff376","63ad8b154097070d11bff377"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792bf","mniswId":"16196","title":"PLANT FOODS FOR HUMAN NUTRITION","issn":"0921-9668","eissn":"1573-9104","documentHash":"a27b8f92-c423-4b25-a527-c49012b34fa0"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058371722"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b910c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ogrodowczyk","uuid":"D07F9EC28955A5934880501322D4ED21F7DAE4AAABEBBB6BE0F0B2AFE83F269D32B39654C2AE55DD88563058C23F771C86299989B6D6A395E89B84F903066998","documentHash":"4a448f66-2073-4e5a-b80e-d7f42561eb9a"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5aef","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Wróblewska","uuid":"5DB03D00276FB168A632F58946904D68371579A788199D21A9EF92ED0D66A6CE10D4942D9186141FE9863E443F60CBF7B7368A38845839154002943427732A15","documentHash":"56465ee4-d650-4e09-bfd2-a0d6e9de84a5"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5a5","name":"Maja","lastName":"Jeż","uuid":"6406DEFE2E08B3CD3891A3A864736BA7AA1943A65B4D0665CCA9C895487CEFAF2CF6D4ED3DC943A47FE41EF3027E3C06CE5CF2E046B869295566EBEF7469EF53","documentHash":"f72a0ced-be64-4c33-880f-6f83def00f5b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63adadeb4097070d11c26c48","doi":"10.3390/ani12192605","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85139766204&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The manifold bioactivity and immunoreactivity of microbial proteins of cow and human mature milk in late lactation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The debate over the validity and benefits of breastfeeding children after the age of 1 and the superiority of human over cow’s milk is still ongoing.

So far, the focus has been on the qualitative profile of the microbiota, bacterial interactions with milk compounds, and the metabolites produced by bacteria. However, the role of bacterial proteins in milk, according to the authors’ knowledge, has been analyzed. It is reported that due to the disruption of the regulatory axis of the immune system in the course of hypersensitivity, organisms may give rise to decreased IgA-mediated (physiological) and increased IgE-mediated (hypersensitive) responses even to host gut microbiota proteins. In this publication, the aim was to compare whether the bacterial proteins in the mature human milk of late lactation and cow’s milk of different breeds can determine the different immunoreactive and bioactive properties of milk.\nABSTRACT: (1) Human milk (HM) is a source of many microorganisms, whose structure contains microbial protein (MP). In addition to the known health-promoting properties of HM, many activities, including immunoreactivity, may result from the presence of MP. Cow’s milk (CM)-derived MP may be 10 times more abundant than MP derived from HM. (2) Raw cow’s milk samples of Holstein and Jersey breeds, commercially available pasteurized milk, and milk from three human donors in the late lactation phase were subjected to chemical and microbiological analyzes. Microorganisms from the milk material were recovered, cultured, and their activities were tested. MPs were extracted and their immunoreactivity was tested with human high IgE pooled sera. The milk types were subjected to simulated digestion. Milk and microbial proteins were identified with LCMS and subjected to an in silico analysis of their activities. Their antioxidant potential was analysed with the DPPH method. (3) The MP of HM shows a stronger IgE and IgG immunoreactivity in the tests with human sera compared to the MP of CM (p = 0.001; p = 0.02, respectively). There were no significant differences between the microbes in the MP of different cattle breeds. The MS-identification and in silico tests of milk and microbial proteins confirmed the presence of MP with immunoreactivity and antioxidant potential. (4) MPs possess a broad bioactive effect, which was determined by an in silico tools. The balance between an MP’s individual properties probably determines the raw material’s safety, which undoubtedly requires further research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709442878c28a0473b910c","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5a5","5e709411878c28a0473b5aef"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"art. no 2605 (1-24)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709442878c28a0473b910c","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5a5","5e709411878c28a0473b5aef"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058371756"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63adbc9c4097070d11c31422","name":"Apostolos","lastName":"Zaganiaris","documentHash":"3b01d5cd-e4e6-46ef-b24b-edb35398f58f"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be65b","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Malecka","uuid":"2F8CC52544EFF43CF1E76953D0C0586B2F6299566EAC63AF1564AECAE491CF49887F906BAE50EE4F0C2287067E86FA16A6F9909C6E782805D75E460FED4E7992","documentHash":"9ca0a361-4d78-44f4-a37a-05c162963f20"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be658","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kurzątkowska-Adaszyńska","uuid":"D1FFFD09C055DF4E1CABE6A5A0732B9C8948B66EC350DD4C68E49D1FE636059DE326B3F74CDB3AA362F4F85EB846C040C99905E2E8BD7F631FD32EFF5293EEF1","documentHash":"218a43f8-0d8d-49bd-83f2-7b4e1f4f335c"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be657","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Grabowska","uuid":"99E4EDA26D1AB0BBB99E0D5DBB59BA9C1CF38DA4C10C1EF6457AE972D5D0A5AF3B311AC06E20A64BD2505FEB1D770EB0E6F8F76F5A3AFA91BB9291924A395746","documentHash":"2b049818-67a3-4659-8d7c-ee0ddbffe8ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63adbc9c4097070d11c31421","doi":"10.3390/ijms232213785","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85142662118&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Electrochemical biosensor designed to distinguish tetracyclines derivatives by ssDNA aptamer labelled with ferrocene","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Controlling food safety and preventing the growing spread of antibiotics into food products have been challenging problems for the protection of human health. Hence, the development of easy-to-use, fast, and sensitive analytical methods for the detection of antibiotics in food products has become one of the priorities in the food industry. In this paper, an electrochemical platform based on the ssDNA aptamer for the selective detection of tetracycline has been proposed. The aptasensor is based on a thiolated aptamer, labelled with ferrocene, which has been covalently co-immobilized onto a gold electrode surface with 6-mercaptohexan-1-ol. The changes in the redox activity of ferrocene observed on the aptamer–antibiotics interactions have been the basis of analytical signal generation registered by square-wave voltammetry. Furthermore, the detection of tetracycline-spiked cow milk samples has been successfully demonstrated. The limits of detection (LODs) have been obtained of 0.16 nM and 0.20 nM in the buffer and spiked cow milk, respectively, which exceed the maximum residue level (225 nM) more than 1000 times. The proposed aptasensor offers high selectivity for tetracycline against other structurally related tetracycline derivatives. The developed biosensor characterized by simplicity, a low detection limit, and high reliability shows practical potential for the detection of tetracycline in animal-origin milk."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947f878c28a0473be657","5e70947f878c28a0473be65b","5e70947f878c28a0473be658"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"art. no 13785 (1-13)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947f878c28a0473be65b","63adbc9c4097070d11c31422","5e70947f878c28a0473be657","5e70947f878c28a0473be658"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00c73ad49b31ccede4a01","title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES","issn":"1554-351X","documentHash":"a288b7d3-1d3d-4fa5-969b-c84261917b79"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058371780"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59e8","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":"FFF1C302A4ED581F77AA01D5950E55F14D23CDBCDAD59F843C36670289FB7C56D37700578F5282A4A9F572D9B626394E4F8E70F38AD1BE8043807EDC54FA76BB","documentHash":"e11b06a4-6f92-4cb7-b88c-c8e09d0b50ab"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5890","name":"Robert","lastName":"Rękawiecki","uuid":"628735F54B973B38689AFE229955AB0F8A033305183D099551DBE361D4E670C2FEA0B2B0BF144AEDB81E2F41180B9BA1D5C72D5A91760FC1147F2824FC2D01B7","documentHash":"89c90d91-e466-457a-9ea0-32b253ea76e3"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afaa5","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Młynarczuk","uuid":"4DA291311B702E990D8DB235AB419AFFAFBF983457AD19DCA4F7B2658DD515E8A776861CA6F3B879E9AD3255BECA587D87865812AF36FBFBEF368518A528182A","documentHash":"fbf2bcf2-336f-4cc7-a5ad-6caeb5860ef9"}],"objectId":"63ad85754097070d11bed85e","doi":"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2022.02.011","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85124770660&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Do commonly used herbicides (atrazine and glyphosate) have the potential to impair the contractions, prostaglandin releasing and conducting of oxytocin signal at the bovine cervix in vitro?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Glyphosate (Gly) and atrazine (Atr) are among the most commonly used herbicides in global agriculture.

Hence, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of Atr and Gly on the motor and secretory function of the bovine cervix in vitro as well as receptivity and signal transduction in cervical cell cultures. Cervical strips or cells obtained from cows before ovulation were treated with environmental doses of Atr or Gly (0.1–10 ng/ml) since these herbicides exerted no cytotoxic effect at a dose of 100 ng/ml. Only Atr increased the force of cervical contractions, while both Atr and Gly decreased the secretion of prostaglandins (PGs) without disturbing their synthesis. Moreover, Atr decreased the mRNA expression and protein level of oxytocin receptor (OTR), while Gly increased OTR protein levels. Both Atr and Gly decreased the contents of gap junction proteins (GAPs), Atr decreased the contents of second messengers (diacylglycerol - DAG, inositol-tris-phosphate - IP3), and Gly decreased the level of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) but increased DAG levels. Atr directly enhanced the cervical strips contractions. Both herbicides disturbed cellular signalling and inhibited PGs secretion.

In animals, it generates severe economic problems, including lowered reproductive indices and rising medical treatment costs, and in women, it might lead to severe fertility impairment. In order to determine how the autonomic nervous system responds to such a pathological state, an experimental group of pigs were treated with Escherichia coli injection into the uterine horns, and several ganglions responsible for innervation of this organ were examined, including the paracervical ganglion located on both sides of the broad ligament of the uterus. The results clearly showed a strong impact of the inflammation on the chemical coding of neurons, some even synthesizing neurotransmitters de novo such as the GAL-expressing perikarya. Additionally, applied injections decreased the number of parasympathetic, acetylcholinesterase-expressing neurons implying the importance of the cholinergic population to keep the inflammation under control. The obtained data serve as a basis for the future implementation of modern treatment and enhancements in animal breeding. \nABSTRACT: The focus of this study was based on examining the impact of endometritis on the chemical coding of the paracervical ganglion (PCG) perikaryal populations supplying pig uterus. Four weeks after the injection of Fast Blue retrograde tracer into uterine horns, either the Escherichia coli (E. coli) suspension or saline solution was applied to both horns. Laparotomy treatment was performed for the control group. Uterine cervices containing PCG were extracted on the eighth day after previous treatments. Subsequent macroscopic and histopathologic examinations acknowledged the severe form of acute endometritis in the E. coli-treated gilts, whereas double-labeling immunofluorescence procedures allowed changes to be analyzed in the PCG perikaryal populations coded with vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and/or somatostatin (SOM), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), a neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), galanin (GAL). The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) detection method was used to check for the presence and changes in the expression of this enzyme and further confirm the presence of cholinergic perikarya in PCG. Treatment with E. coli resulted in an increase in VAChT+/VIP+, VAChT+/VIP−, VAChT+/SOM+, VAChT+/SOM−, VAChT+/GAL− and VAChT+/nNOS− PCG uterine perikarya. An additional increase was noted in the non-cholinergic VIP-, SOM- and nNOS-immunopositive populations, as well as a decrease in the number of cholinergic nNOS-positive perikarya. Moreover, the population of cholinergic GAL-expressing perikarya that appeared in the E. coli-injected gilts and E. coli injections lowered the number of AChE-positive perikarya. The neurochemical characteristics of the cholinergic uterine perikarya of the PCG were altered and influenced by the pathological state (inflammation of the uterus). These results may indicate the additional influence of such a state on the functioning of this organ."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb78"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091f5878c28a04738db9c","5e7092d5878c28a04739dab4"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"art. no 1676 (1-16)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d5878c28a04739dab4","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb78","5e7091f5878c28a04738db9c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058371996"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ada63b4097070d11c19c1a","name":"Rina","lastName":"Meidan","documentHash":"d1cfbd32-0bcc-4df6-82df-8c82fc5c5210"},{"objectId":"63ada63b4097070d11c19c19","name":"Jackson","lastName":"Sapuleni","documentHash":"dd6c9561-4d38-4173-88cb-89baad5ead6a"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db92","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":"B098C0A528257742FE7260630F778D12964C7B5C6227723C0B82DB42874A1368CF6017A4E9CA6B7F39C9E84245C06E67EF1E4D8E3489D40F22A3D57CCE9F1BE1","documentHash":"71a82dd5-3af9-42bb-bfe3-be6e20ae2dfa"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ada63b4097070d11c19c18","doi":"10.1186/s12958-022-00970-x","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85134252409&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Diverse actions of sirtuin-1 on ovulatory genes and cell death pathways in human granulosa cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BACKGROUND: Human granulosa-lutein cells (hGLCs) amply express sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a NAD + -dependent deacetylase that is associated with various cellular functions. SIRT1 was shown to elevate cAMP on its own and additively with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), it is therefore interesting to examine if SIRT1 affects other essential hGLC functions. \nMETHODS: Primary hGLCs, obtained from the follicular aspirates of women undergoing IVF and SV40-transfected, immortalized hGLCs (SVOG cells), were used. Primary cells were treated with SIRT1 specific activator SRT2104, as well as hCG or their combination. Additionally, siRNA-targeting SIRT1 construct was used to silence endogenous SIRT1 in SVOG cells. PTGS2, EREG, VEGFA and FGF2 expression was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Apoptotic and necroptotic proteins were determined by specific antibodies in western blotting. Cell viability/apoptosis was determined by the XTT and flow cytometry analyses. Data were analyzed using student t-test or Mann–Whitney U test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD post hoc test.\nRESULTS: In primary and immortalized hGLCs, SRT2104 significantly upregulated key ovulatory and angiogenic genes: PTGS2, EREG, FGF2 and VEGFA, these effects tended to be further augmented in the presence of hCG. Additionally, SRT2104 dose and time-dependently decreased viable cell numbers. Flow cytometry of Annexin V stained cells confirmed that SIRT1 reduced live cell numbers and increased late apoptotic and necrotic cells. Moreover, we found that SIRT1 markedly reduced anti-apoptotic BCL-XL and MCL1 protein levels and increased cleaved forms of pro-apoptotic proteins caspase-3 and PARP. SIRT1 also significantly induced necroptotic proteins RIPK1 and MLKL. RIPK1 inhibitor, necrostatin-1 mitigated SIRT1 actions on RIPK1 and MLKL but also on cleaved caspase-3 and PARP and in accordance on live and apoptotic cells, implying a role for RIPK1 in SIRT1-induced cell death. SIRT1 silencing produced inverse effects on sorted cell populations, anti-apoptotic, pro-apoptotic and necroptotic proteins, corroborating SIRT1 activation.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that in hGLCs, SIRT1 enhances the expression of ovulatory and angiogenic genes while eventually advancing cell death pathways. Interestingly, these seemingly contradictory events may have occurred in a cAMP-dependent manner."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d6878c28a04739db92"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"art. no 104 (1-15)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ada63b4097070d11c19c19","5e7092d6878c28a04739db92","63ada63b4097070d11c19c1a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479509","mniswId":"17198","title":"Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology","issn":"1477-7827","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"96676823-0656-44cf-8764-b7eb6aeab069"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058372047"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ad8a494097070d11bfee6d","name":"Amanda G.","lastName":"Fisher","documentHash":"76f640c1-faf5-45a2-b828-e51c20c2ec99"},{"objectId":"63ad8a494097070d11bfee6c","name":"Gavin","lastName":"Kelsey","documentHash":"39519e79-1b98-44e4-b28d-b7167646874b"},{"objectId":"63ad8a494097070d11bfee6b","name":"Rosalind M.","lastName":"John","documentHash":"e2109fb2-0756-4066-afa6-1d492b19bec6"},{"objectId":"63ad8a494097070d11bfee6a","name":"Matthias","lastName":"Merkenschlager","documentHash":"03e598cf-5748-4ad2-b34e-87976bf43ae7"},{"objectId":"63ad8a494097070d11bfee69","name":"Anne C.","lastName":"Ferguson-Smith","documentHash":"0eecbca5-cfb1-4dab-891c-d83feaf4a499"},{"objectId":"63ad8a494097070d11bfee68","name":"William","lastName":"Watkinson","documentHash":"e16293c3-d2fd-4748-a968-b78a062b5bbc"},{"objectId":"63ad8a494097070d11bfee67","name":"Juan","lastName":"Castillo-Fernandez","documentHash":"43185d7e-a646-476c-8aca-ae08fea5b7d7"},{"objectId":"63ad8a494097070d11bfee66","name":"Anthony G.","lastName":"Uren","documentHash":"7ef386ea-6802-4926-a8b6-620b905b5053"},{"objectId":"63ad8a494097070d11bfee65","name":"Paul M.

Similar processes in mammals can also affect phenotype through intergenerational or trans-generational mechanisms. Here we generate a luciferase knock-in reporter mouse for the imprinted Dlk1 locus to visualise and track epigenetic fidelity across generations. Exposure to high-fat diet in pregnancy provokes sustained re-expression of the normally silent maternal Dlk1 in offspring (loss of imprinting) and increased DNA methylation at the somatic differentially methylated region (sDMR). In the next generation heterogeneous Dlk1 mis-expression is seen exclusively among animals born to F1-exposed females. Oocytes from these females show altered gene and microRNA expression without changes in DNA methylation, and correct imprinting is restored in subsequent generations. Our results illustrate how diet impacts the foetal epigenome, disturbing canonical and non-canonical imprinting mechanisms to modulate the properties of successive generations of offspring."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947f878c28a0473be651"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"art. no 2464 (1-14)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ad8a494097070d11bfee5b","63ad8a494097070d11bfee5c","5e70947f878c28a0473be651","63ad8a494097070d11bfee5d","63ad8a494097070d11bfee5e","63ad8a494097070d11bfee5f","63ad8a494097070d11bfee60","63ad8a494097070d11bfee61","63ad8a494097070d11bfee62","63ad8a494097070d11bfee63","63ad8a494097070d11bfee64","63ad8a494097070d11bfee65","63ad8a494097070d11bfee66","63ad8a494097070d11bfee67","63ad8a494097070d11bfee68","63ad8a494097070d11bfee69","63ad8a494097070d11bfee6a","63ad8a494097070d11bfee6b","63ad8a494097070d11bfee6c","63ad8a494097070d11bfee6d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f7e","mniswId":"14814","title":"Nature Communications","issn":"2041-1723","documentHash":"167820eb-857b-4f7e-affb-5bc3c9056dfe"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058372177"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63adb8754097070d11c2e9f0","name":"Ligia R.","lastName":"Rodrigues","documentHash":"839c152a-0f8a-4335-b1f3-b850abbc1c7d"},{"objectId":"63adb8754097070d11c2e9ef","name":"Jaroslav","lastName":"Katrlik","documentHash":"25b7de45-8a9f-4054-bcaf-31c4411d17ca"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be65a","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Mikuła","uuid":"0C06918C90F78E41E4A026A7C0CAE1609BEFC7A66903F7CD9C43E0A70ACDE5F9D00A42773075FCCC2AFB010AFC1EB11C09CA8F6A959F9DF4F51CEAFDA3C9D24E","documentHash":"703241b4-87b9-4f20-a6ad-3907d38e870a"}],"objectId":"63adb8754097070d11c2e9ee","doi":"10.2174/0929867329666220520123337","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85138022096&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Electrochemical aptasensors for Parkinson’s disease biomarkers detection","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BACKGROUND: Biomarkers are characteristic molecules that can be measured as indicators of biological process status or condition, exhibiting special relevance in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). This disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder very difficult to study given the site of pathology and due to a clinical phenotype that fluctuates over time. Currently there is no definitive diagnostic test, thus clinicians hope that the detection of crucial biomarkers will help to the symptomatic and presymptomatic diagnostics and providing surrogate endpoints to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of new treatments. \nMETHODS: Electrochemical aptasensors are excellent analytical tools that are used in the detection of PD biomarkers, as they are portable, easy to use, and perform real-time analysis.\nRESULTS: In this review, we discuss the most important clinical biomarkers for PD, highlighting their physiological role and function in the disease. Herein, we review for the first time innovative aptasensors for the detection of current potential PD biomarkers based on electrochemical techniques and discuss future alternatives, including ideal analytical platforms for point-of-care diagnostics.\nCONCLUSION: These new tools will be critical not only in the discovery of sensitive, specific, and reliable biomarkers of preclinical PD, but also in the development of tests that can assist in the early detection and differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders and in monitoring disease progression. Various methods for fixing aptamers onto the sensor surfaces, enabling quantitative and specific PD biomarker detection present in synthetic and clinical samples, will also be discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947f878c28a0473be65a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"37","pagesFromTo":"5795-5814","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947f878c28a0473be65a","63adb8754097070d11c2e9ef","63adb8754097070d11c2e9f0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477885","mniswId":"4720","title":"Current Medicinal Chemistry","issn":"0929-8673","eissn":"1875-533X","documentHash":"a852331b-07ea-4448-a7c3-d5f630a9d419"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058372204"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"639c42254097073271164529","name":"Mariana ","lastName":"Nogueira","documentHash":"52427703-ff01-41cb-a678-07009342d7bf"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c121d","name":"Beata","lastName":"Szmatowicz","uuid":"0DF6D34BC3C320822793032C4ECF89A27803F7072C2CAF10AF19B1FC37AD90F834EE28EB84776F8DAF4B2B0BB865ED3E8DC518CD394830090BA28E8A7AB26EA8","documentHash":"dfa59bfd-834d-4fa8-8085-7d12750f9d93"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Drabińska","uuid":"BD8D7BBA04AB3002BD05F55A48A28169F93C36A25B27A9FD4C80B6F6D80302849707C6D419C6E7496425D334AD12A22D9BF153D0B6DAAECCEE5E1E1C38BBA56D","orcidId":"0000-0001-5324-5982","documentHash":"9463e3e0-a836-47ee-b9da-db8e791739ce"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"639c42254097073271164527","doi":"10.3390/molecules27154672","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/15/4672","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Valorisation of Broccoli By-Products: Technological, Sensory and Flavour Properties of Durum Pasta Fortified with Broccoli Leaf Powder","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of broccoli leaf powder (BLP) incorporation on the technological properties, sensory quality and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of durum wheat pasta.

The addition of BLP decreased optimal cooking time and water absorption but increased the swelling index. Firmness and total shearing force decreased with increased BLP content. The obtained pasta was greener than the control, with a higher content of minerals, and an increasing tendency with respect to protein was observed. The VOC profile of enriched pasta was richer and contained compounds typical of broccoli (e.g., dimethyl sulphide), affecting its aroma.

The valorization of underutilized, nutritionally rich byproducts of the food processing industry has been providing new ways for unlocking their potential in the functional food industry or therapeutic food formulations. This review presents a detailed nutritional profile of jamun seeds and its potent application in the food industry as a possible functional ingredient. Along with its beneficial nutritional profile, the review also throws light upon the safety aspects associated with jamun seed consumption along with its acceptable daily intake. Safety and toxicity studies have motivated researchers and industrialists to search for possible applications in the food industry. Jamun seeds with array of nutritional benefits can be an important functional ingredient; however, further extensive research is necessary to find suitable levels of application of jamun seed in food products for harnessing its nutritional potential without affecting the products’ sensory palatability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności

the gums and bones surrounding the teeth or by dysbiosis of the oral microbiome, and the Global Burden of Disease study (2019) reported that periodontal disease affects 20–50% of the global population. In recent years, more preference has been given to natural therapies compared to synthetic drugs in the treatment of periodontal disease, and several oral care products, such as toothpaste, mouthwash, and dentifrices, have been developed comprising honeybee products, such as propolis, honey, royal jelly, and purified bee venom. In this study, we systematically reviewed the literature on the treatment of periodontitis using honeybee products. A literature search was performed using various databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Scopus, clinicaltrials.gov, and Google Scholar. A total of 31 studies were reviewed using eligibility criteria published between January 2016 and December 2021. In vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies (randomized clinical trials) were included. Based on the results of these studies, honeybee products, such as propolis and purified bee venom, were concluded to be effective and safe for use in the treatment of periodontitis mainly due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. However, to obtain reliable results from randomized clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of honeybee products in periodontal treatment with long-term follow-up, a broader sample size and assessment of various clinical parameters are needed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"art. no 823 (1-23)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aea38c409707743b2e1054","63aea38c409707743b2e1055","63aea38c409707743b2e1056","63aea38c409707743b2e1057","63aea38c409707743b2e1058","63aea38c409707743b2e1059","63aea38c409707743b2e105a","63aea38c409707743b2e105b","63aea38c409707743b2e105c","63aea38c409707743b2e105d","63aea38c409707743b2e105e","63aea38c409707743b2e105f","63aea38c409707743b2e1060","63aea38c409707743b2e1061","63aea38c409707743b2e1062","63aea38c409707743b2e1063","63aea38c409707743b2e1064","63aea38c409707743b2e1065","63aea38c409707743b2e1066","63aea38c409707743b2e1067","63aea38c409707743b2e1068","63aea38c409707743b2e1069","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","63aea38c409707743b2e106a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b9c0","mniswId":"1366","title":"Antioxidants","eissn":"2076-3921","websiteLink":"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants/imprint","documentHash":"fdb7a50d-af58-46b4-a0ad-93cd7eaa2f9a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058375897"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aea1c7409707743b2df66a","name":"John F.","lastName":"Kennedy","documentHash":"6043223b-130b-4b3d-b110-34e1a568840b"},{"objectId":"63aea1c7409707743b2df669","name":"Surinder","lastName":"Singh","documentHash":"b32b8295-3b75-4f40-a8e7-e4f180aa7396"},{"objectId":"63aea1c7409707743b2df668","name":"-","lastName":"Radha","documentHash":"9d1ff19e-e49e-4856-a998-a1bf466663dc"},{"objectId":"63aea1c7409707743b2df667","name":"-","lastName":"Reetu","documentHash":"217433f3-7c59-493d-bdfb-efcf2b893e24"},{"objectId":"63aea1c7409707743b2df666","name":"T.","lastName":"Anitha","documentHash":"8525042f-64d5-4e4d-97c8-23d5680832aa"},{"objectId":"63aea1c7409707743b2df665","name":"Varsha","lastName":"Satankar","documentHash":"8ebbd4e6-bd3b-4428-973d-e58965baafdb"},{"objectId":"63aea1c7409707743b2df664","name":"Shashikant","lastName":"Shiddappa Udikeri","documentHash":"b1fa2565-2b69-423b-90f1-4874fb168cfe"},{"objectId":"63aea1c7409707743b2df663","name":"Dipendra","lastName":"Kumar Mahato","documentHash":"f414d7a2-d898-4ec9-93c3-fbfd38493658"},{"objectId":"63aea1c7409707743b2df662","name":"Nadeem","lastName":"Rais","documentHash":"ae65bdcc-6eb8-49c5-a761-b9df81132dba"},{"objectId":"63aea1c7409707743b2df661","name":"R.","lastName":"Pandiselvam","documentHash":"19586dd5-3985-4ee5-9fa1-fd900143cc98"},{"objectId":"63aea1c7409707743b2df660","name":"Deepak","lastName":"Chandran","documentHash":"cab3eeee-6def-410a-b483-2008dbaaa856"},{"objectId":"63aea1c7409707743b2df65f","name":"Ali A.

Their nutritional quality substantially varies with their digestibility, amino acid profile, bioavailability, processing and purity. From a nutritional viewpoint, the ideal integration of proteins from diverse plant sources can supply an adequate amount of essential amino acids to fulfil human health needs. The use of plant-derived proteins has recently gained momentum due to their multifaceted edible and nonedible applications and their biodegradable nature. The use of plant proteins will be essential when animal-derived proteins fail to satisfy the requirements of the global population. Physicochemical properties, structural properties, amino acid composition and functional attributes of plant-based proteins are of great interest to the food and processing industries. This review presents various applications of plant-based proteins as food supplements in human nutrition, edible coating materials for fruits and vegetables, emulsifiers in numerous food products, sources of bioactive peptides in nutra- and pharmaceutical products, hydrogels in drug delivery and nonedible applications as wood adhesives. Distinct biological properties of proteins obtained from plant sources such as peanuts, soybeans, kidney beans, rice, quinoa, sunflowers, cottonseed, camelina, maize and others are also conceptually discussed based on their diverse applications in human health and nutrition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"154","pagesFromTo":"art. no 112620 (1-15)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aea1c7409707743b2df656","63aea1c7409707743b2df657","63aea1c7409707743b2df658","63aea1c7409707743b2df659","63aea1c7409707743b2df65a","63aea1c7409707743b2df65b","63aea1c7409707743b2df65c","63aea1c7409707743b2df65d","63aea1c7409707743b2df65e","63aea1c7409707743b2df65f","63aea1c7409707743b2df660","63aea1c7409707743b2df661","63aea1c7409707743b2df662","63aea1c7409707743b2df663","63aea1c7409707743b2df664","63aea1c7409707743b2df665","63aea1c7409707743b2df666","63aea1c7409707743b2df667","63aea1c7409707743b2df668","63aea1c7409707743b2df669","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","63aea1c7409707743b2df66a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d21","mniswId":"13782","title":"LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY","issn":"0023-6438","documentHash":"65057cd0-9da3-4b12-aff8-a695b90fce69"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058376270"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aea7be409707743b2e31cf","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Mekhemar","documentHash":"cf4f4b3f-abf6-4446-8a93-a7b340b343f1"},{"objectId":"63aea7be409707743b2e31ce","name":"Farouk","lastName":"Gadallah","documentHash":"9ee4cae8-b56b-4284-a7cf-087f9b369f76"},{"objectId":"63aea7be409707743b2e31cd","name":"Ali A.

However, with growing interest in the sustainable use of resources and the circular economy to reduce adverse impacts on the environment, food processing wastes such as onion peel/skin can be extracted and employed as inputs in developing or reformulating nutrient supplements, and pharmacological drugs. This review highlights major bioactive components, especially total phenolics, total flavonoid, quercetin and its derivatives present in onion peel/skin and their therapeutic applications as cardioprotective, neuroprotective, antiobesity, antidiabetic, anticancer and antimicrobial agents. The present review emphasized that onion peel is one of the important agricultural by-products which is rich in bioactive compounds and can be utilized as health promoting ingredient especially in pharmacological and biomedical fields. Thus, with increasing burden of life style disorders/non-communicable diseases, finding suitable natural alternative for their treatment is one major concern of the researchers and onion peel and its extract can be exploited as a prime ingredient."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut

The aim of this study was to check the concentration change of a myo-inositol solution from the time of oral administration and over a 48 h period in Wistar-type rats. All rats received 2 g/kg of inositol as a solution in distilled water by oral gavage. Estimated parameters were based on the serum concentration of myo-inositol observed in nine individual rats with regard to time. Observations were described as a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption and zero-order endogenous input of checked inositol. The highest myo-inositol concentration was observed in the first hour after oral administration in the serum of all tested rats. Then, the concentration began decreasing immediately after the maximal peak. The inositol concentration continued to decrease, but after 24 h its level was still higher than before the administration. The plasma profile of the myo-inositol concentration showed a rapid decline over time, possibly due to the metabolism of this compound."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d8878c28a04739de7e","5e709217878c28a04738fc44","5ee98cd57523404d1000e9f7","5e70937c878c28a0473aacdd","5e70921c878c28a04739011f"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b59eb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"art no 11246 (1-11)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6336985b4097071416281fc0","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbc5","5e7092d8878c28a04739de7e","5e709472878c28a0473bd3dc","5ee98cd57523404d1000e9f7","5e709410878c28a0473b59eb","5e709217878c28a04738fc44","5e70937c878c28a0473aacdd","5e70921c878c28a04739011f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632b09f640970732c4b1756c","year":"2022","volume":"23","number":"19","documentHash":"d6a3d5ef-ead4-446d-af79-a998736ff192"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058379692"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aed184409707743b3176a2","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Krejszeff","documentHash":"3584cf13-1297-454b-b9bb-2d5e05cfd886"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Judycka","uuid":"1BC4BF9E119F09531BF37A15CAB0B8930B3CEAD1AF40343466114BF77590C3D83197AC72C68511FBF2141C1C8BA5A439D9C46314ACF0CF765BCFB4F5151DB784","documentHash":"4562af07-7167-4f8c-8263-56fca5431f8e"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a3e","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"E6653CD78C8754EF7BFD95E57DE5E087BF7A36AB665933A9BAC1A715F746088C182B965CE79BC1C7F02A0EA7D23ECAAE9E04D1192C0A3B46E6C4CE19330E6053","orcidId":"0000-0002-0251-8626","documentHash":"aeb9ef0c-8778-46b7-9db1-66e9b2204884"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588d","name":"BEATA","lastName":"CEJKO","uuid":"CF523C6A81E8B12F45AC952CAEC80BB85387D3F9D5C4A1D1CB73D3958973358EA8FC2B57B13E70E4D6516D099CEB9DAB530C827B4AF53785E8A3800EF3C1FFB3","documentHash":"d521c9d6-a457-4e4b-b91b-bce0ffcae09d"}],"objectId":"63aed184409707743b3176a1","doi":"10.1016/j.anireprosci.2022.107155","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85142430050&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Ide (Leuciscus idus) sperm short-term storage: Effects of different extenders and dilution ratios","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In cyprinids, Tyrode’s (TLP) and Volckaert’s (VRT) solutions are the most frequently used extenders for short-term sperm storage.

A × 4 (1:3) dilution ratio was compared to a × 10 (1:9) dilution ratio for ide sperm storage using TLP supplemented with antibiotics and was tested for a 14-day period. Sperm motility (MOT, %), progressively motile sperm (PRG, %), curvilinear velocity of sperm (VCL, µm s-1), movement linearity (LIN, %), beat cross frequency (BCF, Hz), and the amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH, µm) were verified using a CASA system.

Many studies have reported a negative influence of these chemicals on the soil environment. Natural sources from earthworms and their products, as a result of vermicomposting, may be considered better alternatives. The aim of this review was to reveal the source of antifungal efficiency of vermicompost and its derivatives, such as vermiwash, coelomic fluid, skin secretion of earthworms, and metabolites from decomposer bacteria in vermicompost, in order to highlight their application in agriculture. The synergistic activity of bioactive compounds present in coelomic fluid, mucus, skin secretion, and metabolites from associated bacteria (decomposer) assisted crop plants for effective action against various soil pathogenic fungi, such as Rhizoctoniasolani, Alternaria solani, Aspergillus niger, A.flavus, Fusariumoxysporum, and F. graminearum. Thus, these bioactive metabolites can be recommended to suppress plant fungal diseases.

The survival, DNA fragmentation, transcriptome, and proteome of the endangered sturgeon Acipenser ruthenus were analyzed. Sturgeons are non-model fish species that can provide new insights into the DNA damage response and embryo development. The transcriptomic and proteomic patterns changed significantly after exposure to genotoxicants in a stage-dependent manner. The results of this study indicate a correlation between phenotype formation and changes in transcriptomic and proteomic profiles. CPT and olaparib downregulated oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic pathways, and upregulated pathways involved in nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and homologous recombination. We observed the upregulated expression of zona pellucida sperm-binding proteins in all treatment groups, as well as the upregulation of several glycolytic enzymes. The analysis of gene expression revealed several markers of DNA damage response and adaptive stress response, which could be applied in toxicological studies on fish embryos.

In the absence of pregnancy, the CL undergoes regression (luteolysis), which is a crucial preparation step for the next estrous cycle. Luteolysis, initiated by uterine prostaglandin F2α (PGF) in cattle, is usually divided into two phases, namely functional luteolysis characterized by a decline in P4 concentration and structural luteolysis characterized by the elimination of luteal tissues from the ovary. Programmed cell death (PCD) of luteal cells, including luteal steroidogenic cells (LSCs) and luteal endothelial cells (LECs), plays a crucial role in structural luteolysis. The main types of PCD are caspase-dependent apoptosis (type 1), autophagic cell death (ACD) via the autophagy-related gene (ATG) family (type 2), and receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-dependent programmed necrosis (necroptosis, type 3). However, these PCD signaling pathways are not completely independent and interact with each other. Over the past several decades, most studies on luteolysis have focused on apoptosis as the principal mode of bovine luteal cell death. Recently, ATG family members were reported to be expressed in bovine CL, and their levels increased during luteolysis. Furthermore, the expression of RIPKs, which are crucial mediators of necroptosis, is reported to increase in bovine CL during luteolysis and is upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines in bovine LSCs and LECs. Therefore, apoptosis, ACD, and necroptosis may contribute to bovine CL regression. In this article, we present the recent findings regarding the mechanisms of the three main types of PCD and the contribution of these mechanisms to luteolysis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940d878c28a0473b5892"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"355-360","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aeb6d5409707743b2f0ccb","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","63aeb6d5409707743b2f0ccc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478a33","mniswId":"12521","title":"JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT","issn":"0916-8818","eissn":"1348-4400","documentHash":"47917926-0c74-4927-b6df-86f40087e46e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058382819"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f9","name":"Marta","lastName":"Romaniewicz","uuid":"BA5EC58C9F256FE6720F5651D92CEF665E3BCF665094161E53CC5310C495C2675DB0017F09E02E829694D6D3EB77F7A42E803B09B6B5F16FC2AE40EC63F0BA71","documentHash":"bf5d1b33-4dab-434d-9665-49faf6c0ede9"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb78","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Jana","uuid":"5D4B0E336E73144B09790CF99721D7DB734426CD38366D150AB2972D78FFDB81EC2C0A02BA072D3A6BFFE3A430E9249FEBAC050619876FA5E3ED772CA7E24FB7","documentHash":"29e0a18b-21f2-42e6-812f-9cf1ca486c04"},{"objectId":"5e7092d5878c28a04739dab2","name":"Marta","lastName":"Brzozowska","uuid":"C15B1D6371834FFF0348E1E6D5B351D4C9C5C98B441D7A1DA7F10704092E7A37943F3D4490A0741B7F3978C65DEEAAF4C1FBD62B5A442CE863C02E774DE85840","orcidId":"0000-0002-7233-4187","documentHash":"412608c9-72e6-4e3d-a40f-acbd5d5c9599"},{"objectId":"5e7091f5878c28a04738db9c","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Całka","uuid":"3594C62ED7C1B0C78E83B9B28512D72BC0E41EDDE4E97D77824392BA985EFEE9CEA61E43550910027F97F87681F54BAD215D7AED8DD9898DA32528F6986D5C5B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4679-5737","documentHash":"df4b0fea-15b1-42a0-be0b-a906195be565"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aed3f2409707743b3198f8","doi":"10.3390/ijms232113184","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effects of substance P and neurokinin A on the contractile activity of inflamed porcine uterus","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Disturbances in uterine contractile activity contribute to the development of inflammation, and recent evidence indicates that tachykinins, including substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA), are involved in controlling uterine function.

The severe acute endometritis developed in the E. coli group and the expression of NK1R and NK2R proteins increased in the myometrium. Compared to the pre-administration period, SP (10−6 M) reduced the amplitude and frequency in the myometrium of the E. coli group and the amplitude was higher and the frequency was lower versus other groups. NKA reduced the amplitude and increased the frequency in endometrium/myometrium of the E. coli group. In this group, the amplitude was lower and the frequency was higher than in the CON and SAL groups. Our research showed that NK2R (10−6 M) antagonist application abolished the NKA inhibitory effect on uterine amplitude. The application of the NK1R (10−5 M) antagonist together with SP revealed that the inhibitory effect of SP on uterine contractility is achieved independently of the NKR1. Additionally, taking into account the fact that NKA shows an inhibitory effect with the use of NK2R on uterine amplitude suggests the possibility of therapeutic use of the antagonist as a drug increasing uterine contractility in inflammation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f9","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb78"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091f5878c28a04738db9c","5e7092d5878c28a04739dab2"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"21","pagesFromTo":"art. no 13184 (1-16)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d5878c28a04739dab2","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f9","5e7091f5878c28a04738db9c","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb78"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00c73ad49b31ccede4a01","title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES","issn":"1554-351X","documentHash":"a288b7d3-1d3d-4fa5-969b-c84261917b79"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058383024"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aed712409707743b31b429","name":"Sawsan O.","lastName":"Khoja","documentHash":"d9425c76-3444-401c-8118-20f45865000d"},{"objectId":"63aed712409707743b31b428","name":"Huda F.","lastName":"Alshaibi","documentHash":"66e3ad1c-28b2-47a8-b2e8-c66ce4cbd5f7"},{"objectId":"63aed712409707743b31b427","name":"Hadeil M.","lastName":"Alsufiani","documentHash":"bacd4cc2-e775-4917-ac79-c403cc08f95a"},{"objectId":"63aed712409707743b31b426","name":"Nusaibah N.","lastName":"Enaibsi","documentHash":"22b7ee70-d372-451f-ad8a-8a7a99c5b349"},{"objectId":"63aed712409707743b31b425","name":"Shareefa A.","lastName":"AlGhamdi","documentHash":"905437c3-a687-419d-b716-67701b3c3442"},{"objectId":"6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","name":"Carsten","lastName":"Carlberg","uuid":"7A3E0E7963E1192270F3903EEFFAA1A086E27754D1B393FD104F68B8A691171F30A075FDFF073A66B06C35CCE685244FF4287E47226B5FB73CCE42A85608CA83","documentHash":"50649f30-9531-42e7-8c6c-543c2bbfecb8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aed712409707743b31b424","doi":"10.3390/ijms231911992","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85139929218&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A single oral vitamin D3 bolus reduces inflammatory markers in healthy Saudi males","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Vitamin D deficiency has increased in the general population and is a public health issue. Vitamin D plays an important role in regulating the immune system, e.g., by modulating the production of inflammatory cytokines. In most countries, the recommended maximal daily dose of vitamin D3 is 4000 IU (100 µg) per day. In this study, we investigated whether a single vitamin D3 bolus can reduce the levels of the inflammatory markers interleukin (IL) 6, IL8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) within one month. Fifty healthy Saudi males were recruited from the local community in Jeddah city and were orally supplemented with a single dose of 80,000 IU vitamin D3. Serum samples were collected at time points 0, 1 and 30 days, and serum levels of IL6, IL8 and TNF, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3), triglycerides, cholesterol, calcium (Ca2+) and phosphate (PO4−) were determined. On average, the vitamin D3 bolus resulted in a significant increase in vitamin D status as well as in a significant decrease in the levels of inflammatory cytokines even one month after supplementation without changing serum Ca2+, PO4− or lipid levels. In conclusion, single high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation is safe for reducing inflammation markers and may lead to an update of current recommendations for vitamin D intake, in order to prevent critical health problems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"art. no 11992 (1-13)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aed712409707743b31b425","63aed712409707743b31b426","63aed712409707743b31b427","63aed712409707743b31b428","63aed712409707743b31b429","6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00c73ad49b31ccede4a01","title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES","issn":"1554-351X","documentHash":"a288b7d3-1d3d-4fa5-969b-c84261917b79"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058383028"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aec0e9409707743b300541","name":"Alexander V.","lastName":"Sirotkin","documentHash":"bb0c96de-aad8-4a51-af96-d89cc61e7c72"},{"objectId":"63aec0e9409707743b300540","name":"Saleh","lastName":"Alwasel","documentHash":"ef740295-0d0c-4a58-82a0-238daaf2af97"},{"objectId":"63aec0e9409707743b30053f","name":"Abdel Halim","lastName":"Harrath","documentHash":"b4bd4dfe-47c4-4fe5-b583-e40d6ccbf5a5"},{"objectId":"63aec0e9409707743b30053e","name":"Adam","lastName":"Tarko","documentHash":"18933739-9a87-4224-800e-342c2376d00c"},{"objectId":"63aec0e9409707743b30053d","name":"Zuzana","lastName":"Fabová","documentHash":"2f2c3345-bd23-4617-ab36-89f7b892ad2d"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c28","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kotwica","uuid":"385A852C4444CB9E0834360EA9CB5447DAA8769BC4824DF6157291803425A6E6379F07FED1C99EFB7D5F465E5A6BE9848257FE25794C37B2D7DB4C3937D900CE","documentHash":"3d7a4dfa-c22d-4959-9a2f-2a1c9f18e44c"}],"objectId":"63aec0e9409707743b30053c","doi":"10.1111/rda.14204","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85134071213&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Tribulus terrestris can suppress the adverse effect of toluene on bovine and equine ovarian granulosa cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Influence of oil-related product toluene and herbal remedy puncturevine Tribulus terrestris L.

We studied the effect of toluene, TT, and their combination on ovarian granulosa cells from two mammalian species (cows and horses). Viability, markers of proliferation (PCNA) and apoptosis (bax), steroid hormones, IGF-I, oxytocin, and prostaglandin F (PGF) release were analyzed by trypan blue exclusion test, quantitative immunocytochemistry, and EIA/ELISA. Toluene suppressed all analyzed parameters. In both species, TT stimulated proliferation and reduced progesterone, oxytocin, and PGF. In horses, TT inhibited testosterone and IGF-I. In both species, TT supported toluene effect on viability, steroids, IGF-I, and PGF, and inverted its action on apoptosis. In cows, TT promoted toluene effect on proliferation. In horses, TT supported toluene effect on oxytocin but suppressed its influence on proliferation. In both species, toluene induced inhibitory action of TT on viability, steroids, IGF-I, and PGF, and prevented its stimulatory action on proliferation. In cows, toluene supported inhibitory action of TT on oxytocin and prevented its stimulatory action on apoptosis. In horses, toluene induced stimulatory effect of TT on apoptosis. Our results indicate potential toxic toluene effect on farm animal ovaries, applicability of TT as a biostimulator of farm animal reproduction and as a protector against the adverse influence of toluene on female reproduction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"57","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1307-1318","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aec0e9409707743b30053d","63aec0e9409707743b30053e","63aec0e9409707743b30053f","63aec0e9409707743b300540","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c28","63aec0e9409707743b300541"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479507","mniswId":"17196","title":"Reproduction in Domestic Animals","issn":"0936-6768","documentHash":"f9ecbf01-4cda-426a-9eba-5aab9b49c8cf"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058383056"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","name":"Carsten","lastName":"Carlberg","uuid":"7A3E0E7963E1192270F3903EEFFAA1A086E27754D1B393FD104F68B8A691171F30A075FDFF073A66B06C35CCE685244FF4287E47226B5FB73CCE42A85608CA83","documentHash":"50649f30-9531-42e7-8c6c-543c2bbfecb8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aed2ea409707743b318f30","doi":"10.3390/nu14153018","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Vitamin D in the context of evolution","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"For at least 1.2 billion years, eukaryotes have been able to synthesize sterols and, therefore, can produce vitamin D when exposed to UV-B. Vitamin D endocrinology was established some 550 million years ago in animals, when the high-affinity nuclear receptor VDR (vitamin D receptor), transport proteins and enzymes for vitamin D metabolism evolved. This enabled vitamin D to regulate, via its target genes, physiological process, the first of which were detoxification and energy metabolism. In this way, vitamin D was enabled to modulate the energy-consuming processes of the innate immune system in its fight against microbes. In the evolving adaptive immune system, vitamin D started to act as a negative regulator of growth, which prevents overboarding reactions of T cells in the context of autoimmune diseases. When, some 400 million years ago, species left the ocean and were exposed to gravitation, vitamin D endocrinology took over the additional role as a major regulator of calcium homeostasis, being important for a stable skeleton. Homo sapiens evolved approximately 300,000 years ago in East Africa and had adapted vitamin D endocrinology to the intensive exposure of the equatorial sun.

We found that the best activating solution was composed of 80 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris, with pH 8.0 and 206 mOsm/kg. In spite of this, we also checked the influence of adding the enzyme inhibitors, such as ammonium molybdate–acid phosphatase inhibitor, gossypol – lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor and acetamide–β-N-acetylglucosaminidase inhibitor on perch sperm motility and successful perch fertilisation. We showed that the addition of acid phosphatase inhibitor in perch semen did not affect the process of fertilisation; in contrast, the addition of lactate dehydrogenase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase inhibitors significantly decreased the percentage of perch fertilised eggs. \nABSTRACT: Although methods for the artificial reproduction of perch have been developed, a lack of information remains regarding the enzymes present in its semen, as well as their role in the fertilisation process. In this study, we first select the optimal activating solution for perch fertilisation and then determine the inhibition effect of enzymes that have already been reported as present in the sperm of teleosts—acid phosphatase (AcP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (β-NAGase)—on the percentage of motile spermatozoa and fertilised eggs. Of the 8 studied activation media, a solution composed of 80 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris, with pH 8.0 and 206 mOsm/kg proved to be optimal for perch gametes. The addition of ammonium molybdate (AcP inhibitor) caused no significant reduction in the percentage of fertilised eggs. On the other hand, the addition of 0.25 mM gossypol (LDH inhibitor) and 0.125 M acetamide (β-N-acetylglucosaminidase inhibitor) significantly decreased the fertilisation percentage to 41.1% and 52.4%, respectively, in contrast to the control (89.9 %). Both LDH and β-NAGase thus seem to play a very important role in the perch fertilisation process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def1","uid":"b7S0rtgCmnVgFTB1zXTMPBg","uuid":"43ad9b52-c3ae-4b91-ba5b-11a0a4d98637","name":"Instytut Rybactwa Śródlądowego im.

The oil is rich in with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially, alpha linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), tocopherols, phenolic acids, vitamins, and antioxidants. Extracting CSO through green technologies has been highly efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable, which has also shown to improve its nutritional potential and proved to be eco-friendly than any other traditional or conventional processes. Due to the presence of valuable bioactive metabolites, CSO is proving to be a revolutionary source for food, baking, dairy, pharmaceutical, livestock feed, and cosmetic industries. CSO has been reported to possess antidiabetic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiobesity, antioxidant, antihyperlipidemic, insect-repellent, and skin-healing properties. However, studies on toxicological safety and commercial potency of CSO are limited and therefore the need of the hour is to focus on large-scale molecular mechanistic and clinical studies, which may throw light on the possible translational opportunities of CSO to be utilized to its complete potential. In this review, we have deliberated on the untapped therapeutical possibilities and novel findings about this functional food, its biochemical composition, extraction methods, nutritional profiling, oil stability, and nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications for its health benefits and ability to counter various diseases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"87","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"2798-2819","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ad8e5a4097070d11c04caa","63ad8e5a4097070d11c04cab","63ad8e5a4097070d11c04cac","63ad8e5a4097070d11c04cad","63ad8e5a4097070d11c04cae","63ad8e5a4097070d11c04caf","63ad8e5a4097070d11c04cb0","63ad8e5a4097070d11c04cb1","63ad8e5a4097070d11c04cb2","63ad8e5a4097070d11c04cb3","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454786f7","mniswId":"11148","title":"JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE","issn":"0022-1147","eissn":"1750-3841","documentHash":"f69c028a-f11f-4bb5-b90e-c74748a4121f"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058388489"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ad90da4097070d11c062d2","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Drzewiecka","documentHash":"b550732e-06d7-431b-a593-75e99e03a629"},{"objectId":"63ad90da4097070d11c062d1","name":"Anna","lastName":"Nitkiewicz","documentHash":"e120e188-30c9-40a6-a3db-4e1eeab0498a"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":"4C887615D8CF2C7AED96BBBF9BA5C5F08ED58C03893B40229F8B7BC60591947D230EB5884E4543FA7A07891B19A3B7714641EF4DB0922B7E97E35D4B3AAB996B","documentHash":"b2431fda-02ea-4ffb-9f2a-57ed6c3ab5d1"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbbb","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szuszkiewicz","uuid":"B3C96698E29462BF1C5A76532D81BE3E9DC8036C9E04D0956E04E82B221A1A26F6B1C1F1C4D3A3E47C0920C520572C363D5BCBB48E555EBF9346B7C2CB768FEC","documentHash":"06dee320-66e2-49d6-b2fb-510e5e733749"}],"objectId":"63ad90da4097070d11c062d0","doi":"10.1093/biolre/ioac071","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85135048409&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"miR-26a-5p and miR-125b-5p affect trophoblast genes and cell functions important during early pregnancy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The most critical stage of pregnancy is embryo implantation, which relies on the synchronised developmental capacity of the embryo and uterine receptivity to implantation. In early pregnancy, conceptus and uterus release several factors enabling successful implantation and placentation. Molecules involved in embryo-maternal crosstalk include, but are not limited to, hormones, growth factors and cytokines. The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression) has revolutionized our understanding of many biological processes, including pregnancy. To date, numerous miRNAs have been detected in different species during pregnancy, both at the endometrial and embryonic sites. Thus, miRNAs are considered important regulators of early pregnancy events. Here, we report miR-26a-5p and miR-125b-5p effects on human and pig trophoblast cell function. Both miRNAs change the level of several genes and proteins important for proper embryo development. Moreover, miR-26a-5p stimulates porcine trophoblast proliferation and has a negative impact on its affinity to laminin. However, miR-125b-5p decreases porcine trophoblast cell migration. Our studies suggest that miR-26a-5p and miR-125b-5p can affect early pregnancy functions by regulating genes and processes important for proper conceptuses’ development and progression through the implantation process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63ad90da4097070d11c062d1","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbbb","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89","63ad90da4097070d11c062d2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"107","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"590-604","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d6878c28a04739dbbb","63ad90da4097070d11c062d1","63ad90da4097070d11c062d2","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547735a","mniswId":"2462","title":"BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION","issn":"0006-3363","eissn":"1529-7268","documentHash":"b5b8c008-3b6c-4cf0-a3b0-f9ecdaaa6393"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058388600"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ad99cc4097070d11c0d9de","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Kubara-Poznar","documentHash":"a2ce1e6c-023b-4d88-894b-d6c7d34075ac"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9106","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Starowicz","uuid":"4B013299B3042105F83161B8FEC8C2AFE99A43C0731E4233A861F9527288289333FD7AF50660B70486E0E2F9EAA01C3F56B7B36075573598CE5AD9EED841EF89","documentHash":"1dffe897-4b02-48b2-836f-24fe503b9548"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588a","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":"ACDF393EDD5617E052F030A01229E8428BB6016E08FDEE5C1E197E7D62E799573B6A7AEB725233560EB0788143DDD3D158DAC6D9162C1007A8B980A24A12C7D1","documentHash":"3517728d-3d41-4845-b4aa-3df0dd950582"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-09-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ad99cc4097070d11c0d9dd","doi":"10.1016/j.cofs.2022.100924","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85139328795&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"What are the main sensory attributes that determine the acceptance of meat alternatives?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The market for meat substitutes (mainly consisting of vegetable-based products) is ever growing.

Mares were assigned to the groups (n = 6 per group): (1) an intra-CL saline injection (control); (2) an intra-CL injection of PGE2 (5 mg/ml); (3) an intra-CL injection of hCG (1,500 IU/ml); (4) an intra-U saline administration (control); (5) an intra-U administration of PGE2 (5 mg/5 ml); (6) an intra-U administration of hCG (1,500 IU/5 ml). Progesterone (P4) and PGE2 concentrations were measured in blood plasma samples collected at −2, −1, and 0 (pre-treatment), and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h after treatments. Moreover, effects of different doses of PGE2 application on the concentration of total PGF2α (PGF2α and its main metabolite 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2α– PGFM) was determined. The time point of PGE2, hCG, or saline administration was defined as hour “0” of the experiment.

The diet is the main driver of metabolic activity of gut microbiota, therefore, the ability to degrade phytates by the microbiota of vegans significantly exceeds that of the gut microbiota of omnivores. The aim of the study was to investigate the early phase of the immune response of colonocytes treated with an enzymatic hydrolysate of phytic acid (hPA120) and gut bacteria. (2) Cell lines derived from healthy (NCM460D) and cancer (HCT116) colonic tissue and fecal bacteria from vegan (V) and omnivorous (O) donors were investigated. Fecal bacteria were grown in mucin and phytic acid supplemented medium. Cultured bacteria (BM) were loaded onto colonocytes alone (V BM and O BM) or in combination with the phytate hydrolysate (V BM + hPA120 and O BM + hPA120). After a treatment of 2 h, bacterial adhesion, secretion of cytokines, and the expression of genes and proteins important for immune response were determined. (3) All bacteria-treated colonocytes increased the expression of IL8 compared to controls. The significant increase of the secreted IL-8 (p < 0.01) in both cell lines was observed for O BM and O BM + hPA120. The increase of TNF, IL-1β, and IL-10 secretion in healthy colonocytes (V BM alone and with hPA120 treatments; p < 0.05) and for TNF and IL-10 in cancer cells (treatments except O BM + hPA120 and V BM, respectively; p > 0.05) were stated. A comparison of solely the effect of hPA120 on bacteria-treated colonocytes (BM vs. BM + hPA120) showed that hPA120 decreased expression of NFkB1 and TNFR (p < 0.001) in healthy colonocytes. In cancer colonocytes, the expression of TLR4 and IL1R increased after BM + hPA120 treatment, whereas the secretion of IL-8 and MYD88 and TNFR expression decreased (p < 0.01). (4) The investigated hPA120 showed a differentiated modulatory activity on the immune response of healthy and cancer human colonocytes. Especially when analyzed independently on the gut bacteria origin, it reduced the proinflammatory response of HCT116 cells to gut bacteria, while being neutral for the bacteria-treated healthy colonocytes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b590a","5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","5e709442878c28a0473b910c","5e709411878c28a0473b5aef"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"art. no 4234 (1-18)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940f878c28a0473b590a","5e709442878c28a0473b910c","5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","5e709411878c28a0473b5aef"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","issn":"2072-6643","documentHash":"c19e39d9-34f9-43a7-9c35-a6b3e3ec2726"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058388672"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ada8164097070d11c1ecdc","name":"Nicolaia","lastName":"Iaffaldano","documentHash":"0c55370b-e7f6-43b3-81a3-d56ea8ed7a40"},{"objectId":"63ada8164097070d11c1ecdb","name":"Angela B.","lastName":"Maffione","documentHash":"94e7ae18-de14-481c-8ba3-a74c04f897ae"},{"objectId":"63ada8164097070d11c1ecda","name":"Silvia","lastName":"Cerolini","documentHash":"78dad719-bd02-47d1-a313-b751f4d71327"},{"objectId":"63ada8164097070d11c1ecd9","name":"Michele","lastName":"Di Iorio","documentHash":"6067147a-d93f-43ac-8746-02ab25e66d41"},{"objectId":"63ada8164097070d11c1ecd8","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Słowińska","documentHash":"01ff2615-dc13-42a1-9a5d-f2b49ea8a557"},{"objectId":"63ada8164097070d11c1ecd7","name":"Giusy","lastName":"Rusco","documentHash":"638ee190-9dd8-4eed-ba98-5d736a8d30b6"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Ciereszko","uuid":"8DDAA077AF44261DCF0520E5A544DC624790613E97D31A6E69866CA47B0BE48CA68261CB972862072612A15E8601DFB12A75BC79EB268AE20BF6FDE46BBDCFD3","documentHash":"4ffd62ff-6e05-41ff-9258-58db72ae7b17"}],"objectId":"63ada8164097070d11c1ecd6","doi":"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2022.07.018","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85135937496&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Proteomic analysis of rabbit fresh and cryopreserved semen provides an important insight into molecular mechanisms of cryoinjuries to spermatozoa","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cryoinjury and protein changes are a consequence of cryopreservation and may have a negative impact on sperm quality regarding motility, viability and fertilizing ability. However, potential proteomic changes in rabbit semen throughout the cryopreservation process have never been previously investigated. The aim of the present study was to compare the whole proteome of fresh and cryopreserved rabbit semen (spermatozoa and extracellular fluid), to examine the effects of freeze-thawing on proteins changes in semen. Comparative analysis and identification of proteins was carried out using 2-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis coupled with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Proteomic raw data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD034832 for spermatozoa and PXD034853 for extracellular fluid. Respectively, 107 and 28 proteins differed in abundance in spermatozoa and extracellular fluid between fresh and frozen groups. Most of these proteins were involved in pathways related to energy metabolism and protein quality control under stress conditions, reproductive processes and mechanisms of cell death/survival regulation, resulting in a significant decrease of motility and viability of post-thawing rabbit sperm and its potential fertilizing ability. These results broaden the understanding of the effects of cryopreservation on rabbit semen and represent a new starting point for the development of improved freezing procedures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940d878c28a0473b588b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"191","pagesFromTo":"77-95","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ada8164097070d11c1ecd7","63ada8164097070d11c1ecd8","63ada8164097070d11c1ecd9","63ada8164097070d11c1ecda","63ada8164097070d11c1ecdb","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","63ada8164097070d11c1ecdc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479934","mniswId":"19490","title":"Theriogenology","issn":"0093-691X","eissn":"1879-3231","documentHash":"5a895e76-bf91-415f-9ad3-e560a5ae5bdf"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058388720"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ad8c6d4097070d11c00c64","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Łukaszuk","documentHash":"5a912384-43be-41fb-bbe7-6ec20b6dd6cc"},{"objectId":"60c31a1b9543c72336543d07","name":"Milena","lastName":"Traut","uuid":"D34064B07C9D4E6F52595F830E95A75A173759D9BF4B0E876AB78CB0603B8C9B0F2CA7062578C4814B3855D462E8926524F42866E985A18776E2B77838A2AB6C","documentHash":"faafee2f-faff-44ad-82e9-dd63f030cf72"},{"objectId":"5e70945e878c28a0473bb92a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Jaworska","uuid":"6D946EF41FE2285FFE078868C670833868DDD530DB12707486C151DBD9A5A8CD0BFF9636519DE461CD4C0266F61F6C007773BF1B70537991A34CAE43EEFF4CDB","documentHash":"8977f6a7-78b4-4e8d-ba94-700af9dd2ffe"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b910d","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Boruszewska","uuid":"14F9F68B7C52C8AF797AA1714AC60D33A1C32E6DFF7D28705DD81E00916229AE2BBB8B7D375457740B47724E1D25A1401D95A3B879C025DB3EC9B9C8E41A4017","documentHash":"96915237-9142-4378-99a1-c0f3b986de75"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7da9","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Kowalczyk-Zięba","uuid":"C46DF4E3B58DE74F5863211EF85A1AEF1931B713028896558206DF0E32F1B3021B6244059655D6F6470900EC6E03DD17000D7AB510E8ABA4A7FEE10CBFFB8484","documentHash":"987cbbab-5942-4694-b576-530b46a05816"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af55c","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Wocławek-Potocka","uuid":"5A748C7AA53B85D9AE96914EE4D200991717E8AA6E5F714E3C2849129FA44686553538DFD6EA04B9CBEAAFABAC263F898E81500341C28FEFB77B27CEB4B998EA","documentHash":"549d9925-bf81-4504-b89e-9f8cfaca627b"}],"objectId":"63ad8c6d4097070d11c00c63","doi":"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2022.07.017","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85136095593&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Mitochondrial DNA content and developmental competence of blastocysts derived from pre-pubertal heifer oocytes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the cattle-breeding industry, there is an increasing demand for in vitro embryo production from pre-pubertal heifers.

In the group of pre-pubertal animals, there was a significantly lower number of blastocysts produced in vitro from the same number of collected oocytes, and these blastocysts did not differ from those obtained from pubertal oocytes in terms of their morphological quality. The morphologically appropriate blastocysts derived from pre-pubertal heifers had higher concentrations of reactive oxygen species and glutathione. In blastocysts derived from pre-pubertal heifers, we found alterations in the expression of gene markers for developmental competence, which correlated with higher mitochondrial DNA content, suggesting a lower quality of blastocysts derived from pre-pubertal animals than from pubertal animals.

Moreover, the technological process of mead production such as the step of wort preparation (with or without boiling of wort before fermentation) can be modified. All these factors might have a significant impact on the formation of aroma-active compounds, and therefore, sensory acceptance by consumers. High vacuum distillation, using the so-called solvent assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE) technique, or headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) were applied for the isolation of the odorants. A sensory profile was used to monitor the changes in the aroma of the mead samples. Twenty-eight aroma-active compounds were detected during aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) based on gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) and were finally identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using authentic reference compounds, including methyl propanoate, methyl 3-(methylthio)propanoate, and methional, all of them were identified for the first time in mead. Compounds with high flavor dilution (FD) factors were quantitated via stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) and revealed ethyl acetate (16.4 mg/L) to be the most abundant volatile compound, increasing to 57 mg/L after wort boiling, followed by ethyl hexanoate (both 1.2 mg/L). Furthermore, key aroma compounds were esters such as ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, and ethyl 3-methylbutanoate. The sensory panel evaluated ethanolic, honey-like, clove-like, sweet, and fruity notes as the main aroma descriptors of mead. The significant change in sensory evaluation was noted in the sweet odor of the heat-treated mead.\n="}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709442878c28a0473b9106"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"art. no 710 (1-11)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709442878c28a0473b9106","63ad9a584097070d11c0e0ef"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","documentHash":"8615ffac-9999-41cd-9658-bd5ed633cde5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058388821"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c200ad","name":"Nafis A.","lastName":"Rahman","documentHash":"9950d4e5-ec89-4072-8337-2dafd9e5c859"},{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c200ac","name":"Ilpo","lastName":"Huhtaniemi","documentHash":"6817e171-a62d-4f80-9391-2a14e1e3cdbf"},{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c200ab","name":"Herjan J.T.","lastName":"Coelingh Bennink","documentHash":"ac1042d2-aba4-4b08-b3e1-e63a70c33ff5"},{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c200aa","name":"Slawomir","lastName":"Wołczyński","documentHash":"77cac627-e71e-4749-8a1b-9cce53b8017b"},{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c200a9","name":"Jorma","lastName":"Toppari","documentHash":"1dd0ec6a-be6a-45ac-a3f7-6ad771fa1695"},{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c200a8","name":"Juho-Antti","lastName":"Makela","documentHash":"290c288c-436d-44db-a3a6-2cf198e8b627"},{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c200a7","name":"Sini","lastName":"Leskinen","documentHash":"41a3d375-bf93-414d-8e05-f089c4fab55f"},{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c200a6","name":"Oana","lastName":"Lupu","documentHash":"894c886e-c51d-44b7-9c6a-815c5f4851bb"},{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c200a5","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Chruściel","documentHash":"c438929d-ae31-4c81-9ab7-a3c810af2266"},{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c200a4","name":"Xiangdong","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"da7bd72e-f448-4afd-87e7-ddae6b645507"},{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c200a3","name":"Agata","lastName":"Pilaszewicz-Puza","documentHash":"6fd7012d-5c49-46e1-8012-1695cddd1f13"},{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c200a2","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bernaczyk","documentHash":"fe082418-3734-4f71-a57d-0a7ea9a2a06e"},{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c200a1","name":"Peilan","lastName":"Guod","documentHash":"6cfe4d06-3a36-4ec2-95f5-233898e88d7d"},{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c200a0","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Lebiedzińska","documentHash":"76b9770b-8438-40f4-8e3e-5f2252c30c8e"},{"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c2009f","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Puławska","documentHash":"f2eb7b48-2a79-4b09-9418-d20b5ffa1cc2"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7","name":"Donata","lastName":"Ponikwicka-Tyszko","uuid":"4C35B3EDE357FD25F5812AD7BFAA18400890491C49FE69152441B7233A793EFD09392BB58F197C713C5EE6E5927A0395F623A44B7AD99CE5C735682C01E90555","documentHash":"e93e992c-e87b-4c53-bd72-ba444a6e657b"}],"objectId":"63ada9c04097070d11c2009e","doi":"10.1016/j.mce.2021.111502","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85118473941&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Novel expression of zona pellucida 3 protein in normal testis; potential functional implications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The expression of the zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 (ZP3), originally thought to be specific for oocytes, was recently extended to ovarian, prostate, colorectal and lung cancers.

Strong ZP3 expression was found in normal human and mouse testis. ZP3 protein and mRNA transcripts were localized in spermatogonia, spermatocytes and round and elongated spermatids of both human and mouse testis, as well as in a mouse spermatogonial cell line, but absent in testicular Sertoli, Leydig, spermatogonial stem and progenitor cells.

Whereas, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is responsible for decidualization and epithelial remodeling in humans and mice, its role in porcine endometrium has not been explored before. In present study, we observed a pregnancy dependent increase in gene and protein expression of STAT3. Activated STAT3 (pSTAT3), was predominantly present in endometrium of pregnant animals in luminal and glandular epithelium and in the endothelium of blood vessels with a weak staining in stromal cells. Interleukins, IL-1β and IL-6 and growth factor EGF induced STAT3 expression and activation in endometrial explants collected on Day 13 of the estrous cycle. Biological significance of STAT3 was evaluated by blocking its activation with STAT3 inhibitor, Stattic. Using porcine extracellular matrix (ECM) and adhesion molecule array, EGF was shown to induce changes in gene expression of ECM components: MMP1, MMP3, MMP12, LAMA1, SELL and ICAM1, which was abrogated in the presence of Stattic. Transcriptional activity of STAT3 was observed in promoter regions of MMP3 and MMP12. Additionally, IL-6-induced STAT3 activation in endometrial-endothelial cells (EECs) upregulated VEGF and VCAM1 abundances. Moreover, IL-6 resulted in an increase in EEC proliferation and capillary formation which was reversed in the presence of Stattic. Results of present study reveal a role for STAT3 activation in regulating ECM remodeling and angiogenesis in porcine endometrium to facilitate embryo implantation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c11bf","5e70940d878c28a0473b5894","5e7092d6878c28a04739db8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"107","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1503-1516","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940d878c28a0473b5894","5e7092d6878c28a04739db8b","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11bf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547735a","mniswId":"2462","title":"BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION","issn":"0006-3363","eissn":"1529-7268","documentHash":"b5b8c008-3b6c-4cf0-a3b0-f9ecdaaa6393"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058388880"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ad95284097070d11c0af95","name":"Monika","lastName":"Karczewska-Kupczewska","documentHash":"606c79ee-cd2b-40f3-abb2-5ec68965c133"},{"objectId":"63ad95284097070d11c0af94","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Matulewicz","documentHash":"bba64c1d-0909-4613-8052-a82a531409c8"},{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1afe","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Stefanowicz","uuid":"ED3369B5BFF1FCCBD11A9F8A7D34597148902C6A4EADF5F84A60EA28B2F961E57A6B6B7C081A99AC1B7DAC4D40288B15856E2377C229AC300246A454AE541ED3","orcidId":"0000-0002-1455-7841","documentHash":"bdd1b92b-8a51-4570-a7b6-b140a646262e"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be65e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Nikołajuk","uuid":"ECE44D65FDF55B65918495AD166EBED022AF883020D0ECDF0F2F39309688C11BF41B509DD5B836411281E0D2F9AE95B1D37B606E83F5CF6C0A124A3711C4E6BF","documentHash":"9e359efb-a976-41a0-b041-93d57c2a25cc"},{"objectId":"5e709377878c28a0473aa543","name":"Marek","lastName":"Strączkowski","uuid":"4C90BD5CD933657E8C2E13468D0F43F9A1D03D3C42022BE096D7702400C2E683808300DF5F10899E73239C8A7EDE44524339338D4753052D40652B8E115B9111","documentHash":"1bcfdfb0-ae43-4864-a1d9-9c4626cfc48d"}],"objectId":"63ad95284097070d11c0af93","doi":"10.1007/s12020-022-03018-7","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85125180217&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Relation of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle FKBP5 expression with insulin sensitivity and the regulation of FKBP5 by insulin and free fatty acids","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"PURPOSE: Recent studies suggest that FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51), a negative regulator of glucocorticoid response, encoded by FKBP5, may influence insulin action.

Hyperinsulinemic clamp, subcutaneous AT and skeletal muscle biopsies were performed. In a subgroup of 20 subjects, two 6 h clamps were performed, with and without Intralipid/heparin infusion, and tissue biopsies were obtained before and after each clamp. \nRESULTS: AT FKBP5 expression was lower in overweight/obese individuals in comparison with normal-weight individuals (p = 0.004). Muscle FKBP5 expression did not differ between the groups, however, it was inversely related to insulin sensitivity (r = −0.32, p = 0.002). FKBP5 expression decreased in AT (p = 0.003) and increased in muscle (p < 0.0001) after insulin infusion. Intralipid/heparin diminished insulin-induced increase in muscle FKBP5. \nCONCLUSION: Our data show that lower AT FKBP5 expression is related to obesity, whereas muscle FKBP5 expression is associated with insulin resistance.

The aroma compounds of shea butter were extracted by the purge and trap method and analyzed by the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and olfactometry (GC-MS/O) technique. Totals of 51, 49 and 46 aroma compounds were determined in samples from CPE, SE and TE, respectively. It was observed that the volatile compounds of studied material dominated after CPE, in which alcohols (11) were the most abundant chemical group, followed by aldehydes (10) and acids (7). The application of aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) resulted in 22, 20, and 16 key odorants in shea butter from CPE, SE and TE, respectively. 3-Hexanol with flavor dilution (FD) factors (2048 in CPS, 1024 in SE and 64 in TE) was found to be the most active aroma compound in all samples. In the fatty acid fraction obtained using the gas chromatography–flame ionization detector (GC-FID) method, 22, 24 and 19 fatty acids were detected in samples after CPE, SE and TE, respectively. The highest number of fatty acids was determined in shea butter using CPE (89.98%). Stearic and oleic acids were the most dominant fatty acids, and all samples of shea butter were rich sources of saturated fatty acids (SFAs). Moreover, the SE samples showed the highest values of DPPH (238.36 µM TEq/kg) and ABTS (534.96 µM TEq/kg), while the CPE samples had the highest total phenolic content (104.64 mg GAE/kg). Principal component analysis (PCA) clearly indicated that the extraction technique could quantitatively or qualitatively induce changes. Thus, this investigation demonstrated that extraction methods have a considerable impact on the quality and chemical composition of the presented material."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709442878c28a0473b9106"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"art. no 245 (1-18)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63adac5b4097070d11c24f53","63adac5b4097070d11c24f54","63adac5b4097070d11c24f55","5e709442878c28a0473b9106","63adac5b4097070d11c24f56","63adac5b4097070d11c24f57"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d2e6","mniswId":"18392","title":"Separations","issn":"2297-8739","eissn":"2227-9075","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fa2b32e1-6f2f-4bff-af6a-f68cda06b47d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058389078"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c2fea89543c72336543909","name":"Daria","lastName":"Rudewicz-Kowalczyk","uuid":"17953E60A16838A62BFDA82176F83F7B2A9ED8DD978EA4124A2DC6FF3BD0F63FF75835533755C35414AA3151E9278A6699F2105CE22936FA57574D7380497A60","documentHash":"bac2ec09-928c-4029-a67e-39225b27cafb"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be657","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Grabowska","uuid":"99E4EDA26D1AB0BBB99E0D5DBB59BA9C1CF38DA4C10C1EF6457AE972D5D0A5AF3B311AC06E20A64BD2505FEB1D770EB0E6F8F76F5A3AFA91BB9291924A395746","documentHash":"2b049818-67a3-4659-8d7c-ee0ddbffe8ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ada8884097070d11c1f500","doi":"10.3390/molecules27175492","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85137828348&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Antibody-ferrocene conjugates as a platform for electro-chemical detection of low-density lipoprotein","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is a cardiac biomarker identified in the pathology of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Typically, the level of LDL is calculated using the Friedewald relationship based on measured values of total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and triglycerides. Unfortunately, this approach leads to some errors in calculation. Therefore, direct methods that can be used for fast and accurate detection of LDL are needed. The purpose of this study was to develop an electrochemical platform for the detection of LDL based on an antibody–ferrocene conjugate. An anti-apolipoprotein B-100 antibody labeled with ferrocene was covalently immobilized on the layer of 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) on the surface of gold electrodes. Upon interaction between LDL and the antibody–ferrocene conjugate, a decrease in the ferrocene redox signal registered by square wave voltammetry was observed, which depends linearly on the concentration from 0.01 ng/mL to 1.0 ng/mL. The obtained limit of detection was equal to 0.53 ng/mL. Moreover, the satisfied selectivity toward human serum albumin (HSA), HDL, and malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) was observed. In addition, the acceptable recovery rates of LDL in human serum samples indicate the possible application of immunosensors presented in clinical diagnostics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947f878c28a0473be657","60c2fea89543c72336543909"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"art. no 5492 (1-12)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c2fea89543c72336543909","5e70947f878c28a0473be657"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","documentHash":"8615ffac-9999-41cd-9658-bd5ed633cde5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058389089"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ad80994097070d11be3799","name":"Bettina","lastName":"Wagner","documentHash":"6305512f-efff-4c12-a81c-8b6c3af344e7"},{"objectId":"63ad80994097070d11be3798","name":"Amanda M.","lastName":"de Mestre","documentHash":"815d56b3-5236-498c-9ef8-24a76172921c"},{"objectId":"5e70945e878c28a0473bb92a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Jaworska","uuid":"6D946EF41FE2285FFE078868C670833868DDD530DB12707486C151DBD9A5A8CD0BFF9636519DE461CD4C0266F61F6C007773BF1B70537991A34CAE43EEFF4CDB","documentHash":"8977f6a7-78b4-4e8d-ba94-700af9dd2ffe"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7da9","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Kowalczyk-Zięba","uuid":"C46DF4E3B58DE74F5863211EF85A1AEF1931B713028896558206DF0E32F1B3021B6244059655D6F6470900EC6E03DD17000D7AB510E8ABA4A7FEE10CBFFB8484","documentHash":"987cbbab-5942-4694-b576-530b46a05816"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af55c","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Wocławek-Potocka","uuid":"5A748C7AA53B85D9AE96914EE4D200991717E8AA6E5F714E3C2849129FA44686553538DFD6EA04B9CBEAAFABAC263F898E81500341C28FEFB77B27CEB4B998EA","documentHash":"549d9925-bf81-4504-b89e-9f8cfaca627b"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbde","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Wiśniewska","uuid":"A84FEBA4975A51AED39CF946B85809DC5306351D2859D9DE960BEC046C5EC07EBFBE0830C4A5BDDFB47E0C4863860C1D9E694F3F6A3AB670542514E1CC60189C","documentHash":"217c8086-496c-4f22-a9a7-efa3c22dd041"},{"objectId":"5e7092d5878c28a04739daa8","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Nowicki","uuid":"DB49411EDDEA5A6B13C277ADA936C3F58A20E8659F43EE2DBA0C42FB900B50B237E88E9DB7F244337F3D3652E0604ACB7DD487525CD9B1EA63C276BBAF4B66FF","orcidId":"0000-0002-8776-9490","documentHash":"f35f9c42-20e7-4835-8715-b2de8e5ea7e2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ad80994097070d11be3797","doi":"10.3390/ani12233373","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85143551190&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Populations of NK cells and regulatory T cells in the endometrium of cycling mares - a preliminary study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Endometrial immune cells, such as regulatory T cells and NK cells, are not well known in mares. Nevertheless, these cells play important roles both in physiological and pathological processes in equine reproduction. This work aimed to characterize populations of regulatory T cells and NK cells in the endometrium of cycling mares. With the use of specific antibodies, we showed that two different types of regulatory T cells and NK cells are present both during estrus and diestrus in mares. ABSTRACT: Endometrial immune cells are essential to support uterine functions across the estrous cycle and in preparation for pregnancy. It has been acknowledged that changes in phenotype and/or numbers of lymphocytes, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and NK cells, might result in lower fertility in women and mice. Little is known about equine endometrial immune cells across the estrous cycle. Here, we compared the populations of endometrial Tregs and NK cells in estrus and diestrus in mares. Endometrial biopsy and blood samples were taken in estrus and diestrus from 11 mares ages 4–12 years. Flow cytometry with anti-CD4, -CD25 and -FOXP3 and anti-NKp46 and -CD3 antibodies was used to determine the populations of Tregs and NK cells, respectively. The concentration of progesterone was measured with chemiluminescence immunoassay. The results were analyzed with paired Student t tests. The mean percentage of endometrial CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs was 13.7 ± 6.2% in diestrus and 14.5 ± 5.9% in estrus, while the mean percentage of endometrial CD4+FOXP3+CD25+ Tregs changed from 3.6 ± 2.1% in diestrus to 2 ± 2% in estrus (p = 0.0947). The mean proportion of CD3−NKp46+ lymphocytes in the endometrium was not significantly different, with 6 ± 1% in estrus and 6.5 ± 1.4% in diestrus. There was a large variation in the percentage of NK cells between mares of 2.1–12.7%. This study showed, for the first time, the presence of CD4+FOXP3+CD25+ Tregs and CD3−NKp46+ NK cells in the endometrium of non-pregnant cycling mares. The percentage of Tregs, and to a greater extent NK cells, showed large fluctuations between mares. Both Tregs and NK cells might be important for the preparation of the endometrium for semen deposition and pregnancy; however, further research is required."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d6878c28a04739dbde","5e709430878c28a0473b7da9","5e7093b2878c28a0473af55c","5e70945e878c28a0473bb92a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"art. no 3373 (1-11)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70945e878c28a0473bb92a","63ad80994097070d11be3798","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbde","63ad80994097070d11be3799","5e7092d5878c28a04739daa8","5e709430878c28a0473b7da9","5e7093b2878c28a0473af55c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058389109"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be654","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Więsak","uuid":"9FDF84804F8A28EA0A12F4800C208E50F5788D22881242FBE7BF29FE2532181C35807571D9BF1C9B8C7DCFA9C96D374215E4440A365E934B2C193214D605DD8A","documentHash":"0e9226ef-400a-4d6a-9277-fee99d29ab47"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbc4","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Goryszewska-Szczurek","uuid":"E19F6082DD63B33D67D087E59A20C172513C7A8F936333BB013DF9767F61516A013FCFD83ABAE98DCD230661B5C6AEEA154689E34E6D8A740D96DF0FCED49A7B","documentHash":"b044b623-3289-4475-89a0-3229ef49ea17"}],"objectId":"63ad88354097070d11bf9ebc","doi":"10.1080/19396368.2022.2072788","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85132285319&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of vitrification on the expression of genes in porcine blastocysts derived from in vitro matured oocytes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed to examine the effect of vitrification on the expression of genes that are crucial for porcine early embryo development; cathepsin B (CTSB), growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), and OCT-4, which play an important role in the maintenance of embryonic cell pluripotency. Their gene expression was investigated in expanded blastocysts (day 6–7) derived from in vitro matured oocytes. The quantitative real-time PCR method was used to assess the amount of relative specific transcripts in 20 vitrified (treatment group) and 32 fresh non-vitrified (control group) blastocysts. Vitrification was performed using 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) plus 7.5% ethylene glycol (EG), and in the final step, 15% DMSO plus 15% EG and a 0.5 M sucrose solution and cryotop as a vitrification device. The blastocysts were warmed in 1 M, 0.5 M, and 0.25 M sucrose solution and kept in a culture medium for six hours before their fixation and further qPCR analysis. A significant upregulation in the targeted genes CTSB (p<.006), GDF9 (p<.04), and CDX2 (p<.003) was observed in the vitrified embryos compared to the fresh control group. Interestingly, the OCT-4 mRNA expression level was not affected by vitrification and remained comparable to that of the fresh non-vitrified embryos. In summary, the results of this pilot study showed, that vitrification induced substantial alteration in the expression of CTSB, GDF9, and CDX2 genes but did not influence the expression of OCT-4 gene in porcine in vitro derived blastocysts. Our data on the expression of developmentally important genes in vitrified porcine blastocyst may facilitate: (1) future improvements in culture conditions and/or cryopreservation protocol and (2) understanding the mechanism(s) of cryoinjuries inducing compromised post-thaw embryo development followed by the poor pregnancy outcome after blastocyst transfer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947f878c28a0473be654","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbc4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"239-246","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947f878c28a0473be654","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbc4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798c6","mniswId":"19233","title":"Systems Biology in Reproductive Medicine","issn":"1939-6368","eissn":"1939-6376","documentHash":"05b3d6f9-ce34-4f02-b73f-d5a223e835ce"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058389170"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aeaed8409707743b2e71e7","name":"Xingguo","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"b398a841-ede4-4f75-841b-520cde8d285b"},{"objectId":"63aeaed8409707743b2e71e6","name":"Fatih","lastName":"Oz","documentHash":"8d4030dc-7b77-4acf-b422-5cde00e59b17"},{"objectId":"63aeaed8409707743b2e71e5","name":"Ayman Y.","lastName":"Allam","documentHash":"87c661cc-c25a-4794-b0cf-841d90243a93"},{"objectId":"63aeaed8409707743b2e71e4","name":"Aly Farag","lastName":"El Sheikha","documentHash":"2f00f36d-738c-46b5-857c-056fefc44e96"},{"objectId":"63aeaed8409707743b2e71e3","name":"Emel","lastName":"Oz","documentHash":"3c306406-a968-47a8-990c-537716bc2a1f"},{"objectId":"63aeaed8409707743b2e71e2","name":"Charalampos","lastName":"Proestos","documentHash":"9fdec743-7ab2-4a7e-8cea-2501097e2e28"},{"objectId":"63aeaed8409707743b2e71e1","name":"Frederick","lastName":"Sarpong","documentHash":"39b4890c-661d-4931-8d1e-c3770ee8b5d3"},{"objectId":"63aeaed8409707743b2e71e0","name":"Wei","lastName":"Wei","documentHash":"050a7d18-a25f-4019-9bd9-5c2045584cc5"},{"objectId":"63aeaed8409707743b2e71df","name":"Isam A.","lastName":"Mohamed Ahmed","documentHash":"e243e6b0-0ee8-486e-bced-5b0b40e56e59"},{"objectId":"63aeaed8409707743b2e71de","name":"Emad","lastName":"Karrar","documentHash":"df3fe800-9443-462f-960c-2924c506d281"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aeaed8409707743b2e71dd","doi":"10.3390/molecules27123905","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85132799789&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Characterization of volatile flavor compounds in supercritical fluid separated and identified in gurum (Citrulluslanatus Var. colocynthoide) seed oil using HSME and GC-MS","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, the volatile compound profiles of gurum seed oil were determined using two methods: supercritical CO2 extraction (SFE) and the screw press process (SPP).

A total number of 56 volatile compounds were revealed and identified in oil extracted by SFE, while only 40 compounds were detected in extracted oil by SPP. Acids, aldehydes, esters, ketones, furans, and other components were present in the highest ratio in oil extracted by SFE. In contrast, alcohols and alkenes were found in the highest proportion in oil extracted by SPP. In this study, it was observed that SFE showed an increase in the amounts of volatile compounds and favorably impacted the aroma of gurum seed oil. The results reveal that different extraction methods significantly impact the volatile components of gurum seed oil, and this study can help evaluate the quality of the oil extracted from gurum seeds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"art. no 3905 (1-10)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aeaed8409707743b2e71de","63aeaed8409707743b2e71df","63aeaed8409707743b2e71e0","63aeaed8409707743b2e71e1","63aeaed8409707743b2e71e2","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","63aeaed8409707743b2e71e3","63aeaed8409707743b2e71e4","63aeaed8409707743b2e71e5","63aeaed8409707743b2e71e6","63aeaed8409707743b2e71e7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","documentHash":"8615ffac-9999-41cd-9658-bd5ed633cde5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058391995"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5890","name":"Robert","lastName":"Rękawiecki","uuid":"628735F54B973B38689AFE229955AB0F8A033305183D099551DBE361D4E670C2FEA0B2B0BF144AEDB81E2F41180B9BA1D5C72D5A91760FC1147F2824FC2D01B7","documentHash":"89c90d91-e466-457a-9ea0-32b253ea76e3"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588f","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kowalik","uuid":"7A7C3A9F21F6AB89CF7A93BE9AFD84358C361AF1ED8C2FD983B77498398EB447F35B9C99B1AA1CBA0B31DD725219020B8BC567823865E988B3DAE715A8E589D5","orcidId":"0000-0001-7637-0911","documentHash":"bc59a033-f672-4d53-adfe-4d685d38e0cd"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afaa5","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Młynarczuk","uuid":"4DA291311B702E990D8DB235AB419AFFAFBF983457AD19DCA4F7B2658DD515E8A776861CA6F3B879E9AD3255BECA587D87865812AF36FBFBEF368518A528182A","documentHash":"fbf2bcf2-336f-4cc7-a5ad-6caeb5860ef9"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbca","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Dobrzyń","uuid":"1817C552DD0504006B1CAA0AC185291E00852802083FD53F484AEA3CE5C43901C03D2FA2B0132153131363418B5A62DF504645945E83B646E4D808D3951F5A5D","documentHash":"d2520629-19a8-4aa6-8c70-f34885d386ca"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aea946409707743b2e437f","doi":"10.3390/ani12040519","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85124966274&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of steroid hormones, prostaglandins (E2 and F2α), oxytocin, and tumor necrosis factor alpha on membrane progesterone (P4) receptors gene expression in bovine myometrial cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The myometrium is one of the layers of the uterus. It consists of smooth muscle and can therefore stretch during pregnancy and contract during parturition. Thus, it can assist oocyte fertilization and its transport in the fallopian tube as well as the blastocyst implantation process. Myometrial function is regulated by the activation of several signal transduction pathways and the expression of many genes. Among them are non-genomic membrane progesterone (P4) receptors such as progesterone receptor membrane components (PGRMC) 1 and 2 and membrane progestin receptors (mPR) alpha (mPRα), beta (mPRβ), and gamma (mPRγ). Their improper action may cause disturbances in fertilization and the correct course of the estrous cycle and pregnancy. The results of this study indicate the possible role of P4, estradiol (E2), prostaglandins (PG) E2 and F2α, oxytocin (OT), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in the regulation of membrane P4 receptor gene expression. This suggests that the local hormonal milieu may influence the activity of these receptors and P4 action in myometrial cells during the estrous cycle. Therefore, elucidation of the mechanisms by which the action of membrane P4 receptors in the myometrium is regulated may be an important element in understanding the proper functioning of the uterus and can help to reduce abnormalities in the course of pregnancy in cows. \nABSTRACT: Myometrium tissue shows the expression of non-genomic membrane progesterone (P4) receptors, such as progesterone receptor membrane components (PGRMC) 1 and 2 and membrane progestin receptors (mPR) alpha (mPRα), beta (mPRβ), and gamma (mPRγ). Their variable expression in the bovine uterus during the estrous cycle and early pregnancy suggests that ovarian steroids and luteotropic and/or luteolytic factors may regulate the expression of these receptors in the myometrium. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effect of P4, estradiol (E2), P4 with E2, prostaglandins (PG) E2 and F2α, oxytocin (OT), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) on the gene expression of PGRMC1, PGRMC2, serpine-1 mRNA-binding protein (SERBP1), and mPRα, mPRβ, and mPRγ in bovine myometrial cells from days 6 to 10 and 11 to 16 of the estrous cycle. The PGE2 concentration and mRNA expression were determined by EIA and real-time PCR, respectively. The data indicated that P4 and E2 can affect the mRNA expression of all studied receptors and SERPB1. However, PGE2, OT, and TNFα could only modulate the expression of PGRMC1, PGRMC2, and SERPB1, respectively. Steroids/factors changed the expression of PGRMC and mPR genes depending on the dose, the stage of the estrous cycle, and the types of receptors. This suggests that the local hormonal milieu may influence the activity of these receptors and P4 action in myometrial cells during the estrous cycle."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d6878c28a04739dbca","5e70940d878c28a0473b588f","5e7093b7878c28a0473afaa5","5e70940d878c28a0473b5890"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"art. no 519 (1-13)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940d878c28a0473b588f","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbca","5e7093b7878c28a0473afaa5","5e70940d878c28a0473b5890"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058392008"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aebcea409707743b2fa5d2","name":"Katsutoshi","lastName":"Arai","documentHash":"52273d04-fc20-4bfa-a8d1-ed8190f392e7"},{"objectId":"63aebcea409707743b2fa5d1","name":"Kiyoshi","lastName":"Naruse","documentHash":"7776e810-e98a-4f31-832a-c133d467407e"},{"objectId":"63aebcea409707743b2fa5d0","name":"Etsuro","lastName":"Yamaha","documentHash":"192d7582-c7db-4d1c-9100-1c7549123d0b"},{"objectId":"63aebcea409707743b2fa5cf","name":"Eisuke","lastName":"Takahashi","documentHash":"1b5e574b-d0e8-4f2b-b26e-2827fa20e8a0"},{"objectId":"63aebcea409707743b2fa5ce","name":"Yuya","lastName":"Kogame","documentHash":"3b6fd881-3dd4-42c3-803b-24da31ed6487"},{"objectId":"63aebcea409707743b2fa5cd","name":"Mitsuru","lastName":"Endoh","documentHash":"21adf04b-9302-4dd1-ba4b-3e201c834d6e"},{"objectId":"63aebcea409707743b2fa5cc","name":"Takahisa","lastName":"Kaneyasu","documentHash":"19038112-e358-4d02-b231-5fbc0c138008"},{"objectId":"63aebcea409707743b2fa5cb","name":"Takafumi","lastName":"Fujimoto","documentHash":"8bac1995-6180-487f-a4e8-b7aa464bf289"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a9a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Nynca","uuid":"9E82C5936C039B79A324F23B55C43462134DBAA1208015B893257894A36FE8A2AB8D67CCBB71DD51FE30BB4FE32033795DB8A295C77CFA5F1F42800291CA5C9C","documentHash":"e8223465-a8e0-408d-aeea-7640f9a9ac3c"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Ciereszko","uuid":"8DDAA077AF44261DCF0520E5A544DC624790613E97D31A6E69866CA47B0BE48CA68261CB972862072612A15E8601DFB12A75BC79EB268AE20BF6FDE46BBDCFD3","documentHash":"4ffd62ff-6e05-41ff-9258-58db72ae7b17"}],"objectId":"63aebcea409707743b2fa5ca","doi":"10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738305","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85129501225&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Cryopreservation of masu salmon sperm using glucose-methanol extender and seminal plasma biomarkers related to post-thaw sperm motility","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the cryopreservation of masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) semen, using 0.18 M glucose in 9% methanol as an extender, and to characterize semen parameters (sperm motility; sperm concentration; and seminal plasma parameters such as pH, electric conductivity, DNA concentration, and protein concentration), with respect to post-thaw sperm motility. Semen samples were collected from fishes in the middle of the spawning season, at Toya Lake station, Hokkaido University, and the end of the spawning season, at the Nanae freshwater station, Hokkaido University. The semen was diluted with the extender at a 1:5 ratio (semen:extender) and then equilibrated for 15 min. The final concentration was 0.15 M and 7.5% for glucose and methanol, respectively. Sperm motility was assessed for fresh, fresh-diluted, and post-thaw semen using computer-assisted sperm analysis. The post-thaw sperm showed lower motility, compared with those of fresh and fresh-diluted sperm, which ranged from 33.9% to 82.9% and 1.5% to 27.1% in the semen collected in the middle and end the spawning season, respectively. Sperm concentration, pH, and electric conductivity of the semen collected at the end of the spawning season were lower than those of semen collected in the middle of the spawning season. Moreover, remarkably high DNA concentrations were detected in the semen at the end of the spawning season, although no difference was observed in protein concentration. Finally, semen cryopreserved using the aforementioned method could be used for artificial fertilization to produce offspring. These results indicate that the glucose-methanol extender is useful for sperm cryopreservation in masu salmon and that the suitability of semen for cryopreservation is affected by the condition of the parental fish."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a9a","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"557","pagesFromTo":"art. no 738305 (1-7)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aebcea409707743b2fa5cb","63aebcea409707743b2fa5cc","63aebcea409707743b2fa5cd","63aebcea409707743b2fa5ce","5e709410878c28a0473b5a9a","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","63aebcea409707743b2fa5cf","63aebcea409707743b2fa5d0","63aebcea409707743b2fa5d1","63aebcea409707743b2fa5d2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547715a","mniswId":"1539","title":"Aquaculture","issn":"0044-8486","eissn":"1873-5622","documentHash":"aaff1260-3172-4786-b919-d851b47a7a44"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058392179"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aebc1c409707743b2f9aca","name":"Artur","lastName":"Padzik","documentHash":"ad8c5084-dd16-4a33-af9f-c5d629e20d52"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c1218","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kopcewicz","uuid":"66CD009C69DD0F61579E7F67B8786F65C54D186DEC7D1A2AC9FDA4B4E81DA062E637D9073344AC3E132864F30B190FE1E5B340FC8B5766052EAA157E59EDD318","documentHash":"d3fa89ad-657a-4a00-b252-f7ebbe826100"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b63ac","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Gawrońska-Kozak","uuid":"D4BBE5AC228EBE2E419BD472A51DD30302E93F9F036639C39B9DDFFBCE7D8C340D30B30F819C6216E68EF37D37E6988BE5DC445B2AF07AE4E6D62AE152E36250","documentHash":"39634937-c85e-4673-9195-de52aae1ad87"},{"objectId":"5e7093e1878c28a0473b27f7","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Machcińska-Zielińska","uuid":"B6DA8465E3ECA561D094C70FDBC567FC7A96BF8AF5C86A58C40122BC641D1C9DE35DFC2D0993032944C5924F8526158A94743FA637A1CFFE86F865DD6381EB56","documentHash":"aa4ac6e4-5a85-4f8d-8184-2cd5ec8c9ae2"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473aca68","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Walendzik","uuid":"B2E7535F8844AD5751B5455335F5C32587136DA7332B7EB2B553F35DF5C3AF9EF45EFB36E464B9F6E92F44D95E25111B594BBFBAB0AC928D27148917E90BBDB0","documentHash":"cc98dd0d-9776-4f01-bdf6-17e8a8f748d1"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbde","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Wiśniewska","uuid":"A84FEBA4975A51AED39CF946B85809DC5306351D2859D9DE960BEC046C5EC07EBFBE0830C4A5BDDFB47E0C4863860C1D9E694F3F6A3AB670542514E1CC60189C","documentHash":"217c8086-496c-4f22-a9a7-efa3c22dd041"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aebc1c409707743b2f9ac9","doi":"10.3390/ijms23010257","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85121721050&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT) is regulated by Foxn1 and Hif‐1α during the early phase of skin wound healing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT) is involved in the maintenance of skin homeostasis. However, the studies concerning its molecular regulation are limited. In the present paper, we ask whether the introduction of two transcription factors, Foxn1 and Hif-1α, into the post-wounded skin of Foxn1-/- mice regulates dWAT during wound healing (days 3 and 6). We have chosen lentivirus vectors (LVs) as a tool to deliver Foxn1 and Hif-1α into the post-wounded skin. We documented that combinations of both transgenes reduces the number, size and diameter of dermal adipocytes at the wound bed area. The qRT-PCR analysis of pro-adipogenic genes, revealed that LV-Hif-1α alone, or combined with LV-Foxn1, increases the mRNA expression of Pparγ, Glut 4 and Fasn at post-wounding day 6. However, the most spectacular stimulatory effect of Foxn1 and/or Hif-1α was observed for Igf2, the growth factor participating in adipogenic signal transduction. Our data also shows that Foxn1/Hif-1α, at post-wounding day 3, reduces levels of CD68 and MIP-1γ mRNA expression and the percentage of CD68 positive cells in the wound site. In conclusion, the present data are the first to document that Foxn1 and Hif-1α cooperatively (1) regulate dWAT during the proliferative phase of skin wound healing through the Igf2 signaling pathway, and (2) reduce the macrophages content in the wound site."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej

opportunity to directly utilize plant-derived proteins in human diets. Recently, the utilization of agro-industrial-generated raw byproducts has attracted the attention of modern food industries toward the production of sustainable, nutritious, and biofriendly products. Plant-derived proteins are among the promising materials being investigated. In particular, cottonseed protein, an important byproduct generated during the processing of cottonseed, is abundant in basic amino acids linked with several bioactivities. The suitability of using cottonseed protein products in terms of functional attributes and nutritional value in food systems will ultimately determine the magnitude of their application in the food industry. Techniques used for the most effective extraction of cottonseed protein with an esculent gossypol concentration have been comprehensively discussed. The bioactivities of enzymatically obtained cottonseed protein hydrolysates can be employed for fabricating bioactive packaging materials. Cottonseed proteins exhibit a plethora of bioactivities, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activities. Their superior functional food properties and relatively lower cost than other plant proteins make them suitable candidates for various food and nonfood applications. In this review, recent developments regarding the extraction, hydrolysate preparation, bioactivities, and industrial applications of cottonseed protein are thoroughly discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"131","pagesFromTo":"art. no 107776","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aea60e409707743b2e22e0","63aea60e409707743b2e22e1","63aea60e409707743b2e22e2","63aea60e409707743b2e22e3","63aea60e409707743b2e22e4","63aea60e409707743b2e22e5","63aea60e409707743b2e22e6","63aea60e409707743b2e22e7","63aea60e409707743b2e22e8","63aea60e409707743b2e22e9","63aea60e409707743b2e22ea","63aea60e409707743b2e22eb","63aea60e409707743b2e22ec","63aea60e409707743b2e22ed","63aea60e409707743b2e22ee","63aea60e409707743b2e22ef","63aea60e409707743b2e22f0","63aea60e409707743b2e22f1","63aea60e409707743b2e22f2","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","63aea60e409707743b2e22f3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477d13","mniswId":"6696","title":"FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS","issn":"0268-005X","documentHash":"7824f169-274c-4b49-b141-2fe99fe0b21c"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058392313"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aebed0409707743b2fe320","name":"Iraj","lastName":"Efatpanah","documentHash":"80dcc9bd-7b06-4bf6-9ead-fc268e5a35cb"},{"objectId":"63aebed0409707743b2fe31f","name":"Erfan A.","lastName":"Nargesi","documentHash":"a99b8092-2ad5-4cb3-b6d0-30e9ec2bde2b"},{"objectId":"63aebed0409707743b2fe31e","name":"Bahram","lastName":"Falahatkar","documentHash":"2381cb23-8e1a-4671-ac7c-a05cc3ebe367"},{"objectId":"5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Żarski","uuid":"C79A8111D2D012910483FF5D04C579E9FE114BBBFDBA5CB7C07AD1BEF561D1BD73734995AC49C0CF23B9AA29ACAE919DB99FD8CDFA546404CB973C5E79C1ADB2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3082-9250","documentHash":"720051ea-3868-48ad-9aab-29755a850bd5"}],"objectId":"63aebed0409707743b2fe31d","doi":"10.1016/j.anireprosci.2022.107055","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85138568673&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The effectiveness of human chorionic gonadotropin in stimulation of second spermiation in pikeperch Sander lucioperca during the spawning season","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in stimulation of second spermiation in already reproduced pikeperch males during the same spawning season. Fish (mean weight 919.9 ± 236.9 g) were divided into the control saline-injected group, and two groups injected with 200 and 400 IU hCG/kg body weight. Forty-eight hours following injection (at a temperature of 16.7 °C) the percentage of fish producing useable amounts of semen increased from 30% in the control group up to 80% in the treated fish and the highest volume of semen was recorded in fish treated with 400 IU/kg BW hCG. Spermatocrit (50.7 ± 9.1%) and sperm concentration (17.5 ± 5.0 × 109 spermatozoa/mL) were significantly higher in control fish than those recorded in hCG-treated fish (24.8 ± 7.7% and 8.1 ± 2.4 × 109 spermatozoa/mL in 200 IU/kg; 32.3 ± 17.6% and 10.9 ± 7.5 × 109 spermatozoa/mL in 400 IU/kg). No significant differences were observed between the groups with respect to sperm motility (as a spermatozoa activity time and percentage); however, a change in plasma alkaline phosphatase activity was found in the group injected with 400 IU/kg of hCG. The lack of significant differences in plasma metabolites and cortisol between control and hCG-treated fish indicated that the hCG had no effect on the stress response. Testosterone levels were significantly increased in the hCG-treated fish, whereas no significant differences in 17β-estradiol were recorded. No differences between the groups in plasma levels of thyroid hormones suggested lack of hCG-induced effect on hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis. The results of this study demonstrated that the spermiation of already reproduced pikeperch males could be induced by hCG during the same spawning season. Based on the results on semen volume and concentration, injection with hCG could improve the efficiency of pikeperch reproduction to reduce the number of brooders and costs of juvenile pikeperch production."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"45","pagesFromTo":"art. no 107055 (1-10)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aebed0409707743b2fe31e","63aebed0409707743b2fe31f","63aebed0409707743b2fe320","5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477038","mniswId":"1150","title":"Animal Reproduction Science","issn":"0378-4320","eissn":"1873-2232","documentHash":"84aa4a1b-995d-49c9-b83a-db66bf4dee35"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058392535"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aeba80409707743b2f89f0","name":"Maria","lastName":"Hepel","documentHash":"893bb2e3-425f-4038-b82d-f8a454e3c9ea"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be658","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kurzątkowska-Adaszyńska","uuid":"D1FFFD09C055DF4E1CABE6A5A0732B9C8948B66EC350DD4C68E49D1FE636059DE326B3F74CDB3AA362F4F85EB846C040C99905E2E8BD7F631FD32EFF5293EEF1","documentHash":"218a43f8-0d8d-49bd-83f2-7b4e1f4f335c"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be657","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Grabowska","uuid":"99E4EDA26D1AB0BBB99E0D5DBB59BA9C1CF38DA4C10C1EF6457AE972D5D0A5AF3B311AC06E20A64BD2505FEB1D770EB0E6F8F76F5A3AFA91BB9291924A395746","documentHash":"2b049818-67a3-4659-8d7c-ee0ddbffe8ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aeba80409707743b2f89ef","doi":"10.3390/s22010161","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85121736924&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Advances in design strategies of multiplex electrochemical aptasensors","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In recent years, the need for simple, fast, and economical detection of food and environmental contaminants, and the necessity to monitor biomarkers of different diseases have considerably accelerated the development of biosensor technology. However, designing biosensors capable of simultaneous determination of two or more analytes in a single measurement, for example on a single working electrode in single solution, is still a great challenge. On the other hand, such analysis offers many advantages compared to single analyte tests, such as cost per test, labor, throughput, and convenience. Because of the high sensitivity and scalability of the electrochemical detection systems on the one hand and the specificity of aptamers on the other, the electrochemical aptasensors are considered to be highly effective devices for simultaneous detection of multiple-target analytes. In this review, we describe and evaluate multi-label approaches based on (1) metal quantum dots and metal ions, (2) redox labels, and (3) enzyme labels. We focus on recently developed strategies for multiplex sensing using electrochemical aptasensors.

However, many remote areas of Himachal Pradesh lack information upon the usage of plants for medicinal purposes. The current study was conducted in Kangra Valley (district Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, India) from March 2020 to August 2021 for the documentation of ethnomedicinal plants. Information on the ethnomedicinal plants was collected through extensive field visits using a pretested questionnaire, interviews and group discussions with the selected informants. Data collected from the study site were analysed using three different quantitative indices, viz., use-value, informant consensus factor (ICF) and fidelity level (Fl), (%) to check the importance and homogeneity of traditional ethnomedicinal knowledge among the informants of the study site. A total of 116 informants were selected using the snowball sampling technique. The rural inhabitants of the study area reported a total of 108 plants belonging to 51 families and 95 genera. A maximum number of plant species was reported from the Fabaceae (9) family, followed by Rosaceae (6), Moraceae (5) and Euphorbiaceae (5). The plant part that was most frequently used for the preparation of traditional remedies includes leaves (31%), followed by fruits (13%), whole plants (12%), bark (11%), roots (10%) and flowers (8%). Most of the plant species were used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders (73), followed by dermatological (55) and respiratory disorders (38). The informants reported that the younger generation was not very interested in traditional knowledge due to cultural changes and the acceptance of Western culture. As a result, documenting traditional knowledge and ethnomedicinal plants from various parts of the world is critical. It not only helps in the documentation but also helps in the conservation and protection of endemic and endangered medicinal plants globally."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"148","pagesFromTo":"415-436","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ae9d1f409707743b2dd99d","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd99e","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd99f","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9a0","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9a1","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9a2","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9a3","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9a4","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9a5","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9a6","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9a7","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9a8","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9a9","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9aa","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9ab","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9ac","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9ad","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9ae","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9af","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","63ae9d1f409707743b2dd9b0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454797cb","mniswId":"18733","title":"South African Journal of Botany","issn":"0254-6299","eissn":"1727-9321","documentHash":"0092fce4-ea29-412f-a8bf-7ba2121c9d13"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058392763"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aea83c409707743b2e3f1b","name":"Neha","lastName":"Sinha","documentHash":"37896f3d-37cf-4927-98d4-d20912d3985a"},{"objectId":"63aea83c409707743b2e3f1a","name":"Marisennayya","lastName":"Senapathy","documentHash":"7390de97-2fa3-44f4-b4f9-7df5070d6e87"},{"objectId":"63aea83c409707743b2e3f19","name":"Suman","lastName":"Natta","documentHash":"9ae65cfb-c58c-4490-9623-5e45e62476de"},{"objectId":"63aea83c409707743b2e3f18","name":"Nadeem","lastName":"Rais","documentHash":"a04fc990-edfe-48a8-9a95-9cc82d0e794e"},{"objectId":"63aea83c409707743b2e3f17","name":"Ravi","lastName":"Pandiselvam","documentHash":"6ef90058-1009-4c4f-8349-4a1e16f1df1f"},{"objectId":"63aea83c409707743b2e3f16","name":"Surinder","lastName":"Singh","documentHash":"9eec54cb-9e51-40ef-93be-ab5ec1469b40"},{"objectId":"63aea83c409707743b2e3f15","name":"Sangram","lastName":"Dhumal","documentHash":"f6f9cb46-b4ad-4702-8777-3ef41087700c"},{"objectId":"63aea83c409707743b2e3f14","name":"Muzaffar","lastName":"Hasan","documentHash":"eb46b075-e160-47eb-9595-7dbd67c1ff73"},{"objectId":"63aea83c409707743b2e3f13","name":"Mrunal D.","lastName":"Barbhai","documentHash":"84442259-9905-4ff0-b8c7-2ef20c167ab2"},{"objectId":"63aea83c409707743b2e3f12","name":"Manoj","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"3e8202d6-6f11-452b-b158-94d1c6b7e99d"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aea83c409707743b2e3f11","doi":"10.1111/1750-3841.16297","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85138004065&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Onion (Allium cepa L.) peel: A review on the extraction of bioactive compounds, its antioxidant potential, and its application as a functional food ingredient","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Functional food development is rapidly increasing as a result of consumer consciousness concerning healthy and nutritious foods.

The main focus of this review is to highlight different extraction techniques (both conventional and nonconventional) that can be implemented to extract the bioactive compounds from onion peel and assess their antioxidant activity. Furthermore, this review highlights the major areas for the application of onion peel and its extract as prospective functional ingredients, thus aiding in the preparation of designer foods with additional health benefits. The use of onion peel could also assist in redesigning popularly consumed processed foods, such as baked products, noodles or pasta, as packaging material, meat quality improvers, colorants, and juice clarifiers.

In this study, we compared modulation of the transcriptome of PBMCs by the vitamin D metabolites 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3), 25(OH)D2 and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). Saturating concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3, 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2 resulted after 24 h stimulation in a comparable number and identity of target genes, but below 250 nM 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2 were largely insufficient to affect the transcriptome. The average EC50 values of 206 common target genes were 322 nM for 25(OH)D3 and 295 nM for 25(OH)D2 being some 600-fold higher than 0.48 nM for 1,25(OH)2D3. The type of target gene, such as primary/secondary, direct/indirect or up-/down-regulated, had no significant effect on vitamin D metabolite sensitivity, but individual genes could be classified into high, mid and lower responders. Since the 1α-hydroxylase CYP27B1 is very low expressed in PBMCs and early (4 and 8 h) transcriptome responses to 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2 were as prominent as to 1,25(OH)2D3, both vitamin D metabolites may directly control gene expression.

However, its synthesis and role in the myometrium of the porcine uterus are still not fully described. The objective of this study was to evaluate profiles of PGI2 synthesis and PGI2 receptor expression in the myometrium of gilts throughout the estrous cycle and during early pregnancy and to investigate the in vitro effect of PGI2 on the mRNA expression of factors engaged in smooth muscle contraction, nutrient transport, prostaglandin synthesis and action, and inflammatory response. The obtained results showed that the synthesis of PGI2 changes in the myometrium of pigs during both the estrous cycle and early pregnancy, resulting in much greater concentrations of PGI2 in cyclic than in pregnant gilts. Moreover, PGI2 stimulated the expression of fatty acid transporters and contractility-related calponin 1 and caldesmon 1, whereas it decreased cytokine expression. This study indicates that PGI2 may participate in the regulation of myometrial functions modulating the availability of factors involved in smooth muscle activity and inflammatory reaction in the uterus of pigs.\nABSTRACT: Although prostacyclin (PGI2) has been well described as a regulator of smooth muscle activity, limited data are available concerning its role in the myometrium of pigs. The present research aimed to examine profiles of PGI2 synthase (PTGIS) and PGI2 receptor (PTGIR) expression and 6-keto PGF1α (a PGI2 metabolite) concentrations in the myometrium of gilts throughout the estrous cycle and during early pregnancy using qPCR, Western blot, and/or ELISA methods. Furthermore, myometrial explants were exposed to iloprost (a stable PGI2 analog) to investigate the effect of PGI2 on the mRNA expression of factors engaged in smooth muscle contraction, nutrient transport, prostaglandin synthesis and action, and inflammatory response. PTGIS mRNA expression was greater in cyclic than in pregnant gilts on days 11–12 after estrus and was accompanied by greater concentrations of 6-keto PGF1α detected in cyclic than in pregnant animals on days 11–20. Iloprost stimulated fatty acid transporters and contractility-related calponin 1 and caldesmon 1 mRNA expression and decreased interleukin 1β and tumor necrosis factor transcript abundance. The obtained results indicate a physiologically relevant role of PGI2 during the estrous cycle in the porcine myometrium with its importance for regulating the expression of contractility-, nutrient transport- and inflammatory response-related factors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940d878c28a0473b5891","5e7092d6878c28a04739db92"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"art. no 2237 (1-15)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940d878c28a0473b5891","63aed489409707743b319b9a","5e7092d6878c28a04739db92"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058395673"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","name":"Carsten","lastName":"Carlberg","uuid":"7A3E0E7963E1192270F3903EEFFAA1A086E27754D1B393FD104F68B8A691171F30A075FDFF073A66B06C35CCE685244FF4287E47226B5FB73CCE42A85608CA83","documentHash":"50649f30-9531-42e7-8c6c-543c2bbfecb8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aed386409707743b3193a6","doi":"10.3390/nu14071354","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85126988054&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Vitamin D and its target genes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The vitamin D metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is the natural, high-affinity ligand of the transcription factor vitamin D receptor (VDR).

Vitamin D target genes encode for proteins with a large variety of physiological functions, ranging from the control of calcium homeostasis, innate and adaptive immunity, to cellular differentiation.

The receptor mechanisms of noradrenaline (NA) influencing the contractile activity of an inflamed uterus are poorly recognized. This study was undertaken to determine the participation of α2-adrenergic receptors (ARs) isoforms (A, B, C) in NA-evoked contractility of the pig uterus with severe acute endometritis. Saline (SAL group) or E.coli suspension (E.coli group) were injected into uterine horns, while only laparotomy was performed in the CON group. In relation to the period before NA application, NA decreased the tension, amplitude and frequency in the uterine strips of the CON and SAL groups, and the amplitude and frequency in the E.coli group. In the E.coli group, the amplitude and frequency were lower than in other groups. Compared to NA effect alone, a greater reduction or appearance of a decrease in the amplitude and frequency were noted in all groups following the use of selective α2A- and α2C-ARs antagonists together with NA as well as in the tension in the CON and SAL groups in response to an α2C-ARs antagonist and NA. Such effects were also exerted by an α2B-ARs antagonist with NA on the frequency in all groups and on the amplitude in the CON and SAL groups. To sum up, in an inflammatory-changed porcine uterus, three α2-AR isoforms mediate the effect of NA on contractile frequency, while α2A- and α2C-AR are involved in the control of contractile amplitude. These results could offer new targets for drugs against decreased uterine contractility in inflammation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70921b878c28a04738ffa1","5e7091f5878c28a04738db9c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb78"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"183","pagesFromTo":"41-52","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb78","5e7091f5878c28a04738db9c","5e70921b878c28a04738ffa1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479934","mniswId":"19490","title":"Theriogenology","issn":"0093-691X","eissn":"0093-691X","documentHash":"5f4ba9bb-877b-4f92-a4fd-38461a3a9174"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"634e9841409707350c32bea1","year":"2022","volume":"183","documentHash":"25e9dd47-6831-447e-9228-0077cd9bd6a8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058398659"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6359242b4097076d018ee952","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Semenowicz","documentHash":"201b3276-9368-4c3d-998c-7d229778a49a"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c1201","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kubicka","uuid":"AE55B767C4F550AFA6E07975ACDB0EB3185658DDB7BC49A4E6EBE9E4E159ADAE8AC4AEA7CC675951105F1D905662D97CAD04AA9E3BCAA1389CC54ADE90936D47","documentHash":"27b45d04-aa50-405c-815c-87c013bd88f0"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b910c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ogrodowczyk","uuid":"D07F9EC28955A5934880501322D4ED21F7DAE4AAABEBBB6BE0F0B2AFE83F269D32B39654C2AE55DD88563058C23F771C86299989B6D6A395E89B84F903066998","documentHash":"4a448f66-2073-4e5a-b80e-d7f42561eb9a"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5aef","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Wróblewska","uuid":"5DB03D00276FB168A632F58946904D68371579A788199D21A9EF92ED0D66A6CE10D4942D9186141FE9863E443F60CBF7B7368A38845839154002943427732A15","documentHash":"56465ee4-d650-4e09-bfd2-a0d6e9de84a5"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b590b","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Złotkowska","uuid":"4138A22D7BADB2C0318799405FEF8BAA2149319C25E04CF3C4457BD583B6D8C7EF619812D7F263ECFEE28685239A5A1667A83D1176EA6B132DFC889A9D59A3B7","documentHash":"7faae3c3-4236-427a-9590-e9dfbe9482f5"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a04739011d","name":"Anita","lastName":"Mikołajczyk","uuid":"4C69309717D24868B8EFAC11A3C8784134C6E99EEFE7FEE0AD21F59E8DF89C662C1DD156226D4D05900D1CA1ADD8EFC3504FBB3B9DD563FB4AF91B989DC6568F","orcidId":"0000-0002-5601-6648","documentHash":"9aabef02-625e-49a8-8127-80902a53507b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"OCTOBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"6359242b4097076d018ee94f","doi":"10.3390/nu14204371","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/20/4371/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Immune System Response to 15-kDa Barley Protein: A Mouse Model Study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) proteins are taxonomically homologous to wheat proteins and react with sera from patients with baker’s asthma. In the current work, the crude extract of barley proteins was divided into six fractions on DEAE-Sepharose. Their immunoreactivity in reacting with sera from patients with a confirmed food allergy varied, and the 15-kDa fraction (B–FrVI) showed the strongest response. In silico analysis confirmed that 15-kDa B-FrVI protein belongs to the trypsin/amylase inhibitor family and to a group of MHC type II allergens. In the next step, the immunogenicity of the B-FrVI was examined in a mouse model. It was shown that, compared to the PBS group, administration of B-FrVI to mice induced almost 2× higher amounts of specific IgG, ~217, and IgA ~29, as early as day 28 after immunization, regardless of the route (intraperitoneal or oral) of antigen administration (p < 0.0001).

A total of 1540 Hybrid Converter turkeys were allocated to 4 groups on the day of hatch. Each group consisted of 7 pens with 55 birds per pen. Group ENR was treated with enrofloxacin for the first 5 d of life, group DOX received doxycycline for 5 d and group MON was administered monensin for 84 d. CON birds served as a control group without any antibiotic treatment or MON administration. An analysis of the activity of bacterial enzymes revealed that the cecal microbiota of turkeys were less sensitive to MON than to the other 2 antibiotics. Turkeys subjected to ENR and DOX treatments were characterized by lower (P < 0.05) extracellular activity of cecal bacterial β-glucosidase, compared with groups CON and MON. The extracellular activity of cecal bacterial α-galactosidase and β-galactosidase decreased significantly in response to the experimental treatment with DOX (P < 0.05 vs. CON). Turkeys treated with ENR had higher total activity of bacterial β-galactosidase than those administered DOX or MON. Despite the differences in the enzymatic activity of microbiota, the use of antibiotics did not affect the concentrations of total short-chain fatty acids or ammonia in the cecal digesta of turkeys. A diet containing MON and the early administration of ENR or DOX induced an increase in blood noradrenaline levels (P = 0.004) in 56-day-old turkeys. Early DOX use increased plasma cortisol concentrations (P < 0.001) and decreased plasma serotonin levels (P = 0.006) in 56-day-old turkeys. Over the entire experiment (up to 12 wk of age), the use of MON improved the BW gain of turkeys (P = 0.055) and feed conversion (P = 0.016), compared with the DOX treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091be878c28a0473873ea","uid":"bYQKxifulEuEJLcUdbBIzPA","uuid":"61768707-7dd1-4777-87bb-ee42bb9201f9","name":"Katedra Biochemii i Toksykologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6168e7a875234017e053d534","5e7091f5878c28a04738dbcd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c1210","5e709410878c28a0473b59eb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fc69","5e709217878c28a04738fc66"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"101","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"art. no 102098 (1-10)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709217878c28a04738fc66","5e709410878c28a0473b59eb","5e7091f5878c28a04738dbcd","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1210","6168e7a875234017e053d534","5e709217878c28a04738fc69"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547934f","mniswId":"16421","title":"Poultry Science","issn":"0032-5791","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c9af2e3d-4296-4e43-bd81-af7507096421"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"648c54b340970738371016e0","year":"2022","volume":"101","number":"11","doi":"","documentHash":"c2175e36-0be6-4431-9309-f1edfbe963c5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058425109"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb78","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Jana","uuid":"5D4B0E336E73144B09790CF99721D7DB734426CD38366D150AB2972D78FFDB81EC2C0A02BA072D3A6BFFE3A430E9249FEBAC050619876FA5E3ED772CA7E24FB7","documentHash":"29e0a18b-21f2-42e6-812f-9cf1ca486c04"},{"objectId":"5e7092e3878c28a04739ecf8","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Sikora","uuid":"0477FD9FFE311C75BCEAEB7CCAC915B7E23CD31871F999EEC0A00EFF8347BBA925D0EFE321D7071B6BCC7D34D9B151BAEDAB6F3F2741CA9ED5363925B4F14374","documentHash":"752fb097-2b57-40d9-a7e6-3c65d18e6c48"},{"objectId":"5e7092d5878c28a04739daa1","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Palus","uuid":"0C222CE90B3F6655AA5902F7AD38E5FE82B2212366793AAC9D07D3F12B54C14E918E50DB9D8E5EB056EA931DADC8B15201251317F5595DFCAC48B5B6F10D61D0","orcidId":"0000-0002-7593-9552","documentHash":"e0b67d63-ac8c-4af1-a75c-b63a9fa8641b"},{"objectId":"5e7091f5878c28a04738db9c","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Całka","uuid":"3594C62ED7C1B0C78E83B9B28512D72BC0E41EDDE4E97D77824392BA985EFEE9CEA61E43550910027F97F87681F54BAD215D7AED8DD9898DA32528F6986D5C5B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4679-5737","documentHash":"df4b0fea-15b1-42a0-be0b-a906195be565"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"637cd0674097073b7db56372","doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-23867-6","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23867-6.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Involvement of the calcitonin gene-related peptide system in the modulation of inflamed uterus contractile function in pigs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study analyzed severe acute endometritis action on myometrial density and distribution of protein gene product (PGP)9.5- and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-like immunoreactive nerve fibers and calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) expression, and on CGRP receptor (CGRPR) participation in uterine contractility in pigs.

Mainly due to the ingredients used and their characteristics, GFB has numerous drawbacks such as unsatisfactory texture and rapid staling beyond a low nutritional value. In the present study, flaxseed oil cake extract (FOCE) was used to replace water (25–100%) in GFB formulations in order to test FOCE’s potential to reduce GFB staling and extend microbial stability. Texture (TPA test), water activity (LF NMR), acidity (pH measurements) and microbiological quality of GFBs were tested. Moreover, the content of a lignan with broad health-promoting potential, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), in GFB with FOCE was analyzed. The results showed that the use of FOCE enriched experimental GFB in valuable SDG (217–525 µg/100 g DM) while not causing adverse microbiological changes. A moderate level (25–50%) of FOCE did not change the main texture parameters of GFB stored for 72 h, the quality of which was comparable to control bread without FOCE. Meanwhile, higher proportions of FOCE (75–100% of water replacement) shortened GFB shelf life as determined by water activity and texture profile, suggesting that GFB with FOCE should be consumed fresh. To summarize, FOCE at moderate levels can add value to GFBs without causing a drop in quality, while still fitting in with the idea of zero waste and the circular economy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b590c","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f1878c28a0473c77ec","5e709472878c28a0473bd37b","5e709344878c28a0473a61fd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["609600889543c73526c48d86"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"595","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["609600889543c73526c48d86","5e709472878c28a0473bd37b","5e709344878c28a0473a61fd","5e7094f1878c28a0473c77ec","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","5e70940f878c28a0473b590c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","issn":"2304-8158","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods","documentHash":"064a8447-000a-4e4f-950b-4311ffde6ca3"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["flaxseed","gluten-free breadmaking","secoisolariciresinol diglucoside","microbial stability","LF NMR","texture profile","staling","by-product revalorization"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058481127"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Wiczkowski","uuid":"A445B60E2C80F5319C08EF716E136CD876DC26A2A64B90215992326CEC3E88C747A494DD05BCE2A7CEB5F7E02C4FB6FA78E34EA5D616429F09576334B9B3ED03","documentHash":"5674033e-a108-4b65-93d8-84a69c4a35e7"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59eb","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Juśkiewicz","uuid":"1644050D67ACD80B8BC27ADF8B38AD7DEAFE9E8BEFA53E0A8AF6EFE84AA8E8DEB184121515D6283EE52388411624DBC5FA5D10A17FD77F08CC13332E6FE84C49","documentHash":"8b9659f7-943c-408b-b92c-d518b23bb150"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Drabińska","uuid":"BD8D7BBA04AB3002BD05F55A48A28169F93C36A25B27A9FD4C80B6F6D80302849707C6D419C6E7496425D334AD12A22D9BF153D0B6DAAECCEE5E1E1C38BBA56D","orcidId":"0000-0001-5324-5982","documentHash":"9463e3e0-a836-47ee-b9da-db8e791739ce"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"639c40e440970732711636ab","doi":"10.3390/nu14224805","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu14224805","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Effect of the Restrictive Ketogenic Diet on the Body Composition, Haematological and Biochemical Parameters, Oxidative Stress and Advanced Glycation End-Products in Young Wistar Rats with Diet-Induced Obesity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The plant-based nutraceuticals are receiving increasing interest in recent time. The high attraction to the phytochemicals is associated with their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, which can lead to reduced risk of the development of cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases. One of the most disseminated groups of plant bioactives are phenolic compounds. It was recently hypothesized that phenolic compounds can have the ability to improve the functioning of the gut barrier. The available studies showed that one of the polyphenols, resveratrol, has great potential to improve the integrity of the gut barrier. Very promising results have been obtained with in vitro and animal models. Still, more clinical trials must be performed to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on the gut barrier, especially in individuals with increased intestinal permeability. Moreover, the interplay between phenolic compounds, intestinal microbiota and gut barrier should be carefully evaluated in the future. Therefore, this review offers an overview of the current knowledge about the interaction between polyphenols with a special emphasis on resveratrol and the gut barrier, summarizes the available methods to evaluate the intestinal permeability, discusses the current research gaps and proposes the directions for future studies in this research area."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","5e709410878c28a0473b59eb","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"art. no 4805 (1-16)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d6878c28a04739dbe2","5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","5e709410878c28a0473b59eb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","issn":"2072-6643","eissn":"2072-6643","documentHash":"66793415-2acd-4481-8264-119c658e1575"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6375f88440970765d462fd74","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"22","documentHash":"929b1f05-34d8-4d12-ac88-7b3c6d522b53"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058502154"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63adacbe4097070d11c25779","name":"Hazım S.","lastName":"Tenikecier","documentHash":"4f421567-71b6-46b2-a8bd-bfb1e4a8ab20"},{"objectId":"63adacbe4097070d11c25778","name":"Adnan","lastName":"Orak","documentHash":"064d3590-e893-44d6-a2c5-946b5cb6b862"},{"objectId":"63adacbe4097070d11c25777","name":"Hakime H.","lastName":"Orak","documentHash":"206b62a0-7a0a-4e7d-a490-60d2b5af5692"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b910b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Janiak","uuid":"ED89E67B99A387674B4297A18C3C3CD8AA8413DFBA0D90FADF253FA46010EC54CE3537CDB7CD5E3A22D8F73EACE2151361A73BC32B454350089D09ED3167E4D5","documentHash":"21519e0f-0512-44de-95f6-c1ff5f5d7037"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59e7","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Karamać","uuid":"EA8089F94A8D72605CF49B5A6CE075DB78DBC5FEEB3347DA87E1C34DFF188480B746E4D91ED4BCEA493D67CB34229C7B3C4423C7019602EAF7F0FCC10A661CB9","documentHash":"1f0b8053-1703-4d7c-94cc-8213a343b75a"}],"objectId":"63adacbe4097070d11c25776","doi":"10.13080/z-a.2022.109.005","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85132871953&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Variations of genotypes of Vicia species as influenced by seed phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of different Vicia species, which are cultivated in different areas of Turkey, and the diversity between analysed characters were investigated. For this purpose, 9 genotypes from three Vicia species: common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), Hungarian vetch (Vicia pannonica Crantz.) and Narbon vetch (Vicia narbonensis L.), were used. The experiment was carried out to determine total phenolic content (TPC), content of individual phenolic compounds, to determine ABTS•+ and DPPH• scavenging activity and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) in methanol and acetone extracts of seeds. The TPC of vetch extracts was in range 11.18–30.42 mg GAE g-1 (in methanol extract) and 17.05–59.88 mg GAE g-1 (in acetone extract). Two V. sativa genotypes Cvoe and Cvke stood out among the others with regard to high TPC and antioxidant activity. They also had the highest content of individual hydroxybenzoic acids and flavones. All extracts of V. narbonensis genotypes were characterised by absence of flavones and low TPC and antioxidant activity. GGE biplot analysis revealed the differences of Vicia genotypes based on phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. The significant correlations among TEAC, FRAP and DPPH• scavenging activity and the content of hydroxybenzoic acids were found in both methanol and acetone extracts (P < 0.01). The genotypes were divided into three clusters in acetone extract and two clusters in methanol extract with similarity above 60% in each group by a hierarchical cluster analysis. These results demonstrated that the genotypic differences of Vicia species in terms of TPC and antioxidant activity can be a tool for feed technology studies for animal nutrition, animal welfare and meat quality."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709442878c28a0473b910b","5e709410878c28a0473b59e7","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"109","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"35-42","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63adacbe4097070d11c25777","5e709410878c28a0473b59e7","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","63adacbe4097070d11c25778","5e709442878c28a0473b910b","63adacbe4097070d11c25779"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00ce5ad49b31ccede9150","title":"Zemdirbyste-Agriculture","issn":"1392-3196","eissn":"2335-8947","documentHash":"04190e01-bc96-4300-b968-99a353a78d3e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058529802"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c120d","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Topolska","uuid":"ED6AEEFCDF3A4A51A3789757280F1B4D91423E0BA13FF3748DC4FBDE22EAABE1C03CEAD624CB15F181F2B1E8B29F7D411DFEC79E86C3E5B3A88E64B48FCE620C","documentHash":"3526422f-ff33-422e-8e18-07c5f27a6cc0"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be65c","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wronkowska","uuid":"7AD9D7133FEED3901C208150BF6A4BEC80D1D5476AC1D8C3F2A1D6CC435EA47BBDE118C6497839B2A1CE9986E04B5B72B7E49A7CBCB10520840247E859D56212","documentHash":"cac22030-ab3d-4958-9588-afa00449da3c"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Wiczkowski","uuid":"A445B60E2C80F5319C08EF716E136CD876DC26A2A64B90215992326CEC3E88C747A494DD05BCE2A7CEB5F7E02C4FB6FA78E34EA5D616429F09576334B9B3ED03","documentHash":"5674033e-a108-4b65-93d8-84a69c4a35e7"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588a","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":"ACDF393EDD5617E052F030A01229E8428BB6016E08FDEE5C1E197E7D62E799573B6A7AEB725233560EB0788143DDD3D158DAC6D9162C1007A8B980A24A12C7D1","documentHash":"3517728d-3d41-4845-b4aa-3df0dd950582"},{"objectId":"5e7093f7878c28a0473b41a3","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Piskuła","uuid":"4582BC226B489857AE957B3334CAEA991424FCCC587D91BFE93A97599A84F93E970C039AED805D1D20D9EF9FC624D24792101AC245E0D73F853CDB647157DCA1","documentHash":"bc4fa630-f9bf-4ed6-a0cb-2a1afff52c1d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ad821e4097070d11bea4d0","doi":"10.3390/molecules27196628","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85139823865&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Bioaccessibility of phenolic acids and flavonoids from buckwheat biscuits prepared from flours fermented by lactic acid bacteria","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The literature reports that the consumption of common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), exactly the polyphenols it contains, is associated with a wide spectrum of health benefits. Therefore, the determination of the bioaccessibility of phenolic acids and flavonoids from buckwheat biscuits formulated from liquid-state fermented flours (BBF) by selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) after gastrointestinal digestion was addressed in this study. Bioaccessibility could be defined as the fraction of a compound that is released from the food matrix in the gastrointestinal lumen and used for intestinal absorption. The bioaccessibility of eight phenolic acids (protocatechuic, vanillic, syringic ferulic, caffeic, sinapic, p-coumaric, and t-cinnamic) and six flavonoids (epicatechin, vitexin, orientin, apigenin, kaempferol, and luteolin) were provided for BBF and BBC (buckwheat biscuits prepared from fermented and unfermented flours, respectively). The bioaccessibility indexes (BI) indicated the high bioaccessibility of phenolic acids and improved bioaccessibility of flavonoids from BBF. Moreover, the data provide evidence for the suitability of selected LAB strains to be used as natural sour agents for further bakery product development rich in phenolic acids and flavonoids with LAB-dependent bioaccessibility."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i

Although microbiome research is performed in many different science fields, using similar concepts within and across fields, microbiomes are mostly investigated one ecosystem at-a-time. In order to fully understand microbiome impacts and leverage microbial functions, research needs to adopt a systems approach connecting microbiomes and research initiatives in divergent fields to create understanding on how microbiomes can be modulated for desirable functions as a basis of sustainable, circular bioeconomy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b590a","5e709430878c28a0473b7db9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"73","pagesFromTo":"171-178","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63adbaa44097070d11c30098","63adbaa44097070d11c30099","63adbaa44097070d11c3009a","63adbaa44097070d11c3009b","63adbaa44097070d11c3009c","63adbaa44097070d11c3009d","63adbaa44097070d11c3009e","63adbaa44097070d11c3009f","63adbaa44097070d11c300a0","63adbaa44097070d11c300a1","63adbaa44097070d11c300a2","63adbaa44097070d11c300a3","63adbaa44097070d11c300a4","63adbaa44097070d11c300a5","63adbaa44097070d11c300a6","63adbaa44097070d11c300a7","63adbaa44097070d11c300a8","63adbaa44097070d11c300a9","63adbaa44097070d11c300aa","63adbaa44097070d11c300ab","63adbaa44097070d11c300ac","63adbaa44097070d11c300ad","63adbaa44097070d11c300ae","63adbaa44097070d11c300af","63adbaa44097070d11c300b0","63adbaa44097070d11c300b1","63adbaa44097070d11c300b2","63adbaa44097070d11c300b3","63adbaa44097070d11c300b4","63adbaa44097070d11c300b5","63adbaa44097070d11c300b6","5e70940f878c28a0473b590a","63adbaa44097070d11c300b7","63adbaa44097070d11c300b8","63adbaa44097070d11c300b9","63adbaa44097070d11c300ba","63adbaa44097070d11c300bb","63adbaa44097070d11c300bc","63adbaa44097070d11c300bd","63adbaa44097070d11c300be","63adbaa44097070d11c300bf","63adbaa44097070d11c300c0","63adbaa44097070d11c300c1","63adbaa44097070d11c300c2","5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","63adbaa44097070d11c300c3","63adbaa44097070d11c300c4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477890","mniswId":"4738","title":"Current Opinion in Biotechnology","issn":"0958-1669","eissn":"1879-0429","documentHash":"629d9c02-2d2f-48b1-adf5-5b2154a1bede"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058530248"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11aa","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kłos","uuid":"89D30FE7040BC92B1871A1B9B420E26792C384EE94F13BB7432F4EAE5D19462249ED335D28C7968E68993B93B98AB9238849AFA8080209A2C320B29BA4348218","documentHash":"4ff16c8e-300a-4ce2-8bd6-64801af93737"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b910f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Przygrodzka","uuid":"C7A15EBD7AF715EDCCB90F1F8BA64F1821BCA22277AAE217BD2C7C085DC648B5680C075B77216C7FCEB855A625B7F479B55FEF74F9E9C66CB1BD77E803B35A20","documentHash":"1663237d-947e-4770-8fee-e23075a52014"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59ed","name":"Adam","lastName":"Zięcik","uuid":"2A05001C9CE3F9EC42EF983D510EA9BB69CA53C1477277343787155322B43C63CD1BB4DD3C2008215B6F0CDD006E88CCE6AE8A3C6A33A209AF9E3CD213FC6C5E","documentHash":"c1c54829-cb29-46ae-b0ef-515ad664b50a"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db9c","name":"KAMIL","lastName":"MYSZCZYŃSKI","uuid":"880A7CE391BA7DF745800FB9596A2C112A2B128DE9399F4969165F4F51A342D98754FD80BEBA5C5FAADF1ADB8931FB55C6656B5025D06201AD30A5CDC9A16F71","orcidId":"0000-0002-3118-0900","documentHash":"c1c336e4-851f-4ce4-b582-9e05be54ae33"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63adaa7b4097070d11c220f6","doi":"10.3390/ani12202855","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The role of reduced oxygen supply and transcription ractors cJUN and CREB in progesterone production during the corpus luteum rescue in gilts","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Appropriate function of the corpus luteum and progesterone secretion are fundamental for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Still, there are gaps in the knowledge of mechanisms regulating the maintenance of steroidogenic machinery of porcine corpus luteum during early pregnancy. In the present study, we analyzed the in vitro effects of decreasing oxygen concentration on progesterone production, expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1 subunit alpha (HIF-1A) and expression of genes encoding key stimulators of steroidogenesis, STAR and VEGFA, in the luteal tissue collected from cyclic and early pregnant gilts. In vitro experiments indicate that: (1) progesterone production and genes expression are modulated by decreasing oxygen concentrations and (2) luteal tissue of cyclic and pregnant gilts is similarly sensitive to reduction of oxygen. We also determined the mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1α, STAR, and VEGFA as well as transcription factors-cJUN and CREB, which are known regulators of STAR expression, in the luteal tissue of cyclic and pregnant gilts ex vivo. The relatively high level of STAR, phosphorylated forms of cJUN and CREB and progesterone concentration in the luteal tissue of early pregnant gilts suggests the role of these transcription factors in extension of luteal function. This regulation may be important in supporting luteal rescue during early pregnancy to maintain the production of progesterone. A reduced concentration of oxygen could be involved in the process of corpora lutea regression in gilts. \nABSTRACT: The corpus luteum plays a fundamental role in regulating reproduction via progesterone production. Still, there is little data on factors regulating the maintenance of luteal function during early pregnancy in gilts. Previous studies emphasize the role of hypoxia and HIF-1 in the regulation of steroidogenic and angiogenic genes expression and progesterone production by ovarian cells. Using the corpus luteum of cyclic and early pregnant gilts we analyzed: (1) the in vitro effects of reduced oxygen tension on progesterone production and mRNA expression of HIF1A and luteal function regulators, STAR and VEGFA; (2) the ex vivo profiles of mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1α, STAR, VEGFA and transcription factors-cJUN and CREB, regulating STAR expression, in the corpus luteum of cyclic and pregnant gilts. The synthesis of progesterone was gradually inhibited in cyclic or pregnant gilt luteal tissue (on day 13 of cycle or pregnancy) incubated in a decreasing concentration−20%, 10%, and 3% of oxygen (O2). Luteal tissues of pregnant gilts produced trace amounts of progesterone in 10% O2, which was similar to cyclic gilts in 3% O2. HIF1A expression increased after 24 h of incubation in tissues of cyclic gilts in 3% vs. 20% O2 (p < 0.01), whereas levels of STAR and VEGFA increased significantly in cyclic and pregnant gilt tissues incubated in 10% and 3% vs. 20% O2. The ex vivo mRNA expression of HIF1A and VEGFA was elevated (p < 0.001) on day 14 vs. day 12 of pregnancy. The protein expression of HIF-1 and VEGFA increased (p < 0.001), whereas the level of STAR (mRNA and protein) and progesterone dropped (p < 0.001) on day 14 of the estrous cycle vs. a parallel day of pregnancy and/or day 12 of the estrous cycle. The content of phosphorylated cJUN and CREB was elevated (p < 0.01) in the luteal tissue on day 12 or 14 of pregnancy vs. parallel days of the estrous cycle. These increases of phosphorylated cJUN and CREB may be involved in STAR expression in the luteal tissue during early pregnancy in gilts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709442878c28a0473b910f","5e709410878c28a0473b59ed","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11aa","5e7092d6878c28a04739db9c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"art. no 2855 (1-13)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709442878c28a0473b910f","5e7092d6878c28a04739db9c","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11aa","5e709410878c28a0473b59ed"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058530298"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ad8ddc4097070d11c045c9","name":"Tatsuki","lastName":"Shimamoto","documentHash":"35dfb875-cf66-457f-8eee-d06f1e9de303"},{"objectId":"63ad8ddc4097070d11c045c8","name":"Ayaka","lastName":"Hata","documentHash":"e98de2ff-8cb1-47b7-a10a-a6721266c1d0"},{"objectId":"5e7094f6878c28a0473c8084","name":"Jumpei","lastName":"Tomiyasu","uuid":"6DE49D2F6EAC73459F52C6DFD0DCC0FFE0130EED57D382459D8BB991BA51EA5F9E6E57C6180F29BA7BF00B712DF28C873EA3A34FE58E7CC287EA9997686E6FD1","documentHash":"96609ea8-27fd-415d-a276-a6361c45e695"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-03-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ad8ddc4097070d11c045c7","doi":"10.4404/hystrix-00486-2021","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85142859476&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Testis function of invasive male Pallas’s squirrels (Callosciurus erythraeus) does not change seasonally in a Japanese temperate zone","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The invasive Pallas’s squirrel (Callosciurus erythraeus) is now established in Japan, and it is abundantly fertile, which results in a constant increase in the population and distribution. The reproductive characteristic of this invasive squirrel is a continuous breeding, although native squirrels demonstrate seasonal breeding. The reproductive seasonality of this invasive squirrel seems to be less affected by seasonal changes in food availability, which regulate reproductive seasonality in native species. In the present study, we postulated that testis size index, an indicator of male reproductive function, does not differ between seasons with high (June–November) and low (December–May) food availability, and that it positively correlates with the body condition index throughout the year due to energy allocation to the testis. We therefore assessed seasonal changes in testis size index in euthanized 284 Pallas’s squirrels, and seasonal associations between testis size and body condition indexes. Testis size index did not differ between seasons. Furthermore, testis size and body condition indexes were positively and significantly associated. Our findings suggest that whereas male reproductive effort in this invasive squirrel consumes energy like native species, testis function maintains stable in a whole year. This could be a characteristic of continuous breeding that might be associated with the robust reproductive activity of this squirrel."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f6878c28a0473c8084"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"92-94","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094f6878c28a0473c8084","63ad8ddc4097070d11c045c8","63ad8ddc4097070d11c045c9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebffda1ad49b31ccece2b61","title":"HYSTRIX-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY","issn":"0394-1914","documentHash":"61568a63-62d7-42ff-866a-9509c0958a0e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058530307"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ad9d1d4097070d11c10625","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Łada","documentHash":"f2e41963-206a-4112-b65f-02a8638244b0"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Skarżyński","uuid":"893E2C4B87695FF9AC23B84616C654F5B1E6FC9D903BB90BDCE1C38DABAFE563D8799DF0E9B5E427AD9DE60E48421A2744D5C1C29108A61057E0DC537A800774","orcidId":"0000-0001-9537-3560","documentHash":"f2e476d8-aceb-487d-b95e-e46c79fa4e0b"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af611","name":"Anna","lastName":"Korzekwa","uuid":"6CCA76174E9BF1DF35E4C1E90E2B3B9D78AF9BDADC1E212FB54879C770E920DAC45DD70A8F63FE965B8949684CD8F8490ACB631BBDD818E2C1FDBAC1061F4362","documentHash":"f996b0b0-de34-42e8-8338-b6cd4d848669"},{"objectId":"5e709381878c28a0473ab804","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jończyk","uuid":"DCA38AB3DEDD663AB53645D9AF18011DEEAE59327966396FDDD8C00480564B95D2361A359C31836F1D816D67A7418153CBD058FEF7DFAE69B6A7885D363D4E41","documentHash":"e4eee45c-93db-40b6-b6c2-fce4f190fb50"},{"objectId":"5e7092d5878c28a04739da9b","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Socha","uuid":"5EAF89D7A03F63A282650BB3D874C3C0688C17F8A725939F5C923DBC220A680FBBDEE0030962103B53724323B1120EA11E3B0DF345D8BB48A0D06B92B71F8407","orcidId":"0000-0003-3620-0680","documentHash":"56052eb2-582f-4b2c-9a9a-fe04668f3448"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ad9d1d4097070d11c10624","doi":"10.3390/ani12121542","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85132145844&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors in PGF2α-induced luteolysis in the bovine corpus luteum","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The corpus luteum (CL) is responsible for progesterone (P4) secretion. In the absence of pregnancy, luteolysis occurs, which leads to a reduction in P4 production, followed by the structural regression of the CL. In cows, prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) is the main luteolytic factor. It is also an endogenous ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which are important factors regulating mammalian reproductive function. However, the mechanisms of action of PPAR isoforms, i.e., PPARα, PPARδ and PPARγ, in the luteolytic pathways in cattle are still not fully understood. The aim of this in vitro study was to determine the expression of PPAR isoforms in the bovine CL throughout the estrous cycle, and their involvement in PGF2α-induced processes related to luteolysis. The obtained results indicate that the expression of PPARs changes in the bovine CL throughout the estrous cycle; moreover, PGF2α affects its expression. This study provides evidence that PPARγ, among all examined PPAR isoforms, could be involved in the regulation of PGF2α-induced luteolysis in cattle, and PPARs may affect CL regression at multiple sites. These results help to widen the knowledge of the mechanisms of luteal regression in the bovine CL. \nABSTRACT: The participation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) in ovarian function in cattle is still not fully understood. The aim of this in vitro study was to determine: (i) the immunolocalization, mRNA expression and tissue concentration of PPARα, PPARδ and PPARγ in the bovine corpus luteum (CL) (n = 40) throughout the estrous cycle, and (ii) the involvement of PPAR in PGF2α-induced processes related to luteolysis. CL (n = 9) explants were cultured in the presence of PPAR antagonists (10−5 M) in combination with or without PGF2α receptor antagonist (10−5 M) and PGF2α (10−6 M). The mRNA and protein expression of PPARs was evaluated through qPCR, IHC, and ELISA, respectively. The results showed that PPAR mRNA and protein expression differed according to the luteal stages. PGF2α upregulated PPARδ and PPARγ mRNA expression in the bovine CL in vitro, whereas PPARγ increased the inhibitory effect of PGF2α by decreasing progesterone secretion and the mRNA expression of hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 β- and steroid delta-isomerase 1 (HSD3B1) in the CL explants; mRNA transcription of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was increased. The obtained results indicate that the mRNA and protein expression of PPARs changes in the bovine CL throughout the estrous cycle and under the influence of PGF2α. We suggest that isoform γ, among all examined PPARs, could be a factor involved in the regulation of PGF2α-induced processes related to luteolysis in the bovine CL. Further studies are needed to understand the role of PPAR in luteal regression in the CL of cattle."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709381878c28a0473ab804","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","5e7092d5878c28a04739da9b","5e7093b2878c28a0473af611"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"art. no 1542 (1-20)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d5878c28a04739da9b","63ad9d1d4097070d11c10625","5e709381878c28a0473ab804","5e7093b2878c28a0473af611","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058530332"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ad8d424097070d11c03b70","name":"Daisuke","lastName":"Kondoh","documentHash":"c579b71c-d4b1-4280-9f9c-45f7e6092c72"},{"objectId":"63ad8d424097070d11c03b6f","name":"Frank","lastName":"Rosell","documentHash":"9e49fc2c-83e6-4b5e-9091-78d8a0056861"},{"objectId":"63ad8d424097070d11c03b6e","name":"Christian A.","lastName":"Robstad","documentHash":"30798fcd-9a8a-462f-97ab-86fde148d884"},{"objectId":"63ad8d424097070d11c03b6d","name":"Yusuke K.","lastName":"Kawai","documentHash":"3bda121d-a9ac-41fe-9c3a-09c896d7b1ae"},{"objectId":"5e7094f6878c28a0473c8084","name":"Jumpei","lastName":"Tomiyasu","uuid":"6DE49D2F6EAC73459F52C6DFD0DCC0FFE0130EED57D382459D8BB991BA51EA5F9E6E57C6180F29BA7BF00B712DF28C873EA3A34FE58E7CC287EA9997686E6FD1","documentHash":"96609ea8-27fd-415d-a276-a6361c45e695"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af611","name":"Anna","lastName":"Korzekwa","uuid":"6CCA76174E9BF1DF35E4C1E90E2B3B9D78AF9BDADC1E212FB54879C770E920DAC45DD70A8F63FE965B8949684CD8F8490ACB631BBDD818E2C1FDBAC1061F4362","documentHash":"f996b0b0-de34-42e8-8338-b6cd4d848669"}],"objectId":"63ad8d424097070d11c03b6c","doi":"10.1111/joa.13671","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85128324319&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The vomeronasal system in semiaquatic beavers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In contrast to the main olfactory system that detects volatile chemicals in the nasal air, the vomeronasal system can detect nonvolatile chemicals as well as volatiles. In the vomeronasal system, chemicals are perceived by the vomeronasal organ (VNO) projecting axons to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Beavers (Castor spp.) are semiaquatic mammals that have developed chemical communication. It is possible that the beaver's anal gland secretions, nonvolatile and insoluble substances, may work as a messenger in the water and that beavers may detect the nonvolatile chemicals floating on the water surface via the VNO. The present study aimed to clarify the specificities of the beaver vomeronasal system by histologically and immunohistochemically analyzing the VNO and AOB of 12 Eurasian beavers (C. fiber). The VNO directly opened to the nasal cavity and was independent of a narrow nasopalatine duct connecting the oral and nasal cavities. The VNO comprised soft tissues including sensory and nonsensory epithelium, glands, a venous sinus, an artery, as well as cartilage inner, and bone outer enclosures. The AOB had distinct six layers, and anti-G protein α-i2 and α-o subunits were, respectively, immunoreactive in rostral and caudal glomeruli layers indicating expressions of V1Rs and V2Rs. According to gene repertories analysis, the beavers had 23 and six intact V1R and V2R genes respectively. These findings suggested that beavers recognize volatile odorants and nonvolatile substances using the vomeronasal system. The beaver VNO was developed as well as in other rodents, and it had two specific morphological features, namely, disadvantaged contact with the oral cavity because of a tiny nasopalatine duct, and a double bone and cartilage envelope. Our results highlight the importance of the vomeronasal system in beaver chemical communication and support the possibility that beavers can detect chemicals floating on the water surface via the VNO."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f6878c28a0473c8084","5e7093b2878c28a0473af611"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"241","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"809-819","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094f6878c28a0473c8084","5e7093b2878c28a0473af611","63ad8d424097070d11c03b6d","63ad8d424097070d11c03b6e","63ad8d424097070d11c03b6f","63ad8d424097070d11c03b70"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478454","mniswId":"10108","title":"Journal of Anatomy","issn":"0021-8782","eissn":"1469-7580","documentHash":"604d582c-041b-4107-8a92-720f09b8ce9b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058530442"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63adaf484097070d11c280df","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Dobosz","documentHash":"40766368-3a06-415f-9107-9a4786ba6fc9"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f8","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Wiśniewska","uuid":"9D6F71DDA590B62A4AB94114A5BDE14E1748B11F9F622FCC01E350F86E2B17F96714C9CCFB7861429F0DFEC9FFF8D3DF037A8319F0AE104D06AF9D3E80ADC716","documentHash":"3ad42612-1bf4-4302-bcea-c5a233c4a946"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a9a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Nynca","uuid":"9E82C5936C039B79A324F23B55C43462134DBAA1208015B893257894A36FE8A2AB8D67CCBB71DD51FE30BB4FE32033795DB8A295C77CFA5F1F42800291CA5C9C","documentHash":"e8223465-a8e0-408d-aeea-7640f9a9ac3c"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Ciereszko","uuid":"8DDAA077AF44261DCF0520E5A544DC624790613E97D31A6E69866CA47B0BE48CA68261CB972862072612A15E8601DFB12A75BC79EB268AE20BF6FDE46BBDCFD3","documentHash":"4ffd62ff-6e05-41ff-9258-58db72ae7b17"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb02","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Słowińska","uuid":"D0762DC718D7EAC30B0A7B1DEB3663FAC593E26E90120A900864F5A4224C3BF490276878AED43C63D8FC7232C796898220E54CE793A81C34D6C7B381147091FF","documentHash":"bedfc788-199f-4e30-afd4-c73a28ffe458"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fc28","name":"Jan","lastName":"Jastrzębski","uuid":"D636E1227E0132E9786A52BF078B83BD344FA3CDFA7EC5C1C08CB7AE2B2D3843B835EC42A828F322D146718DE5A61F8C364CE71345EBD31BA46123D08F1E9006","orcidId":"0000-0001-8699-7742","documentHash":"208b6e41-1e91-4bb4-8f40-aefd67194397"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63adaf484097070d11c280dc","doi":"10.1016/j.animal.2022.100594","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85134653695&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Ovarian transcriptome analysis of diploid and triploid rainbow trout revealed new pathways related to gonadal development and fertility","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Triploidisation represents several advantages (e.g. sterility) and therefore is routinely applied in aquaculture of several commercially important fish species, including rainbow trout. The comparative transcriptomic analysis of ovaries of triploid (3N) and diploid (2N) female rainbow trout revealed a total of 9 075 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 4 105 genes upregulated in 2N and 4 970 genes upregulated in 3N ovaries, respectively). Identified clusters for DEGs upregulated in 3N and 2N ovaries were different, including carbohydrate and lipid metabolic process and transport, protein modification, signalling (related to folliculogenesis) and response to stimulus for DEGs upregulated in 2N, and developmental process, signalling (related to apoptosis, cellular senescence and adherence junctions) and regulation of RNA metabolic process for DEGs upregulated in 3N. The enrichment of processes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in 2N ovaries indicated high metabolism of ovarian tissue and the energy reservoir generation indispensable during the earliest stages of development. Our results highlight the importance of oocyte hydration along with oestrogen, insulin, leptin, fibroblast growth factor, and Notch signalling and pathways related to the regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in proper oocyte meiotic maturation prior to ovulation in 2N ovaries. Conversely, triploidisation may lead to an increase in ovarian cellular senescence and apoptosis, which in turn can result in abnormal gonadal morphology and fibrosis. The downregulation of genes responsible for the precise regulation of meiosis and proper chromosome segregation during meiosis probably affects meiotic maturation via irregular meiotic division of chromosomes. The induction of triploidy of the rainbow trout genome resulted in enhanced expression of male-specific genes, genes responsible for re-establishing the transcriptional balance after genome reorganisation and genes involved in regulatory mechanisms, including gene silencing and DNA methylation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide investigation providing in-depth comprehensive and comparative gene expression patterns in the ovary from 2N and 3N rainbow trout females helping in elucidating the molecular mechanisms leading to impaired gonadal development and sterility of female triploids."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a9a","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb02","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fc28"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"art. no 100594 (1-13)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a9a","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb02","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f8","5e709217878c28a04738fc28","63adaf484097070d11c280df","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547702a","mniswId":"1135","title":"Animal.","issn":"1751-7311","eissn":"1751-732X","documentHash":"75e7d827-d0e7-4aaa-99e6-ce35edc7b49b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058530469"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63adaebf4097070d11c27576","name":"J.","lastName":"Bobe","documentHash":"d3ea57cc-fdfa-46a2-98f1-25c7530f249b"},{"objectId":"63adaebf4097070d11c27575","name":"M.","lastName":"Köster","documentHash":"cb39363d-de47-4057-aaf0-89766795689c"},{"objectId":"63adaebf4097070d11c27574","name":"T.","lastName":"Frohlich","documentHash":"d4974104-cc5d-495d-9c40-f240cfeea518"},{"objectId":"5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Żarski","uuid":"C79A8111D2D012910483FF5D04C579E9FE114BBBFDBA5CB7C07AD1BEF561D1BD73734995AC49C0CF23B9AA29ACAE919DB99FD8CDFA546404CB973C5E79C1ADB2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3082-9250","documentHash":"720051ea-3868-48ad-9aab-29755a850bd5"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a9a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Nynca","uuid":"9E82C5936C039B79A324F23B55C43462134DBAA1208015B893257894A36FE8A2AB8D67CCBB71DD51FE30BB4FE32033795DB8A295C77CFA5F1F42800291CA5C9C","documentHash":"e8223465-a8e0-408d-aeea-7640f9a9ac3c"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Ciereszko","uuid":"8DDAA077AF44261DCF0520E5A544DC624790613E97D31A6E69866CA47B0BE48CA68261CB972862072612A15E8601DFB12A75BC79EB268AE20BF6FDE46BBDCFD3","documentHash":"4ffd62ff-6e05-41ff-9258-58db72ae7b17"}],"objectId":"63adaebf4097070d11c27573","doi":"10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737656","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85118578589&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Comparative proteomic analysis reveals the importance of the protective role of ovarian fluid over eggs during the reproduction of pikeperch","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The composition of the ovarian fluid (OF) is predestined for egg storage and for prolonging the fertilization period during natural spawning as well as during artificial fertilization. A thorough characterization of the specific components within the OF and eggs may provide deeper knowledge about their functions, a better understanding of egg-OF signaling, and the origin of the OF proteins, as well as reveal potential biomarkers of oocyte quality and aging. To uncover the protein composition of pikeperch OF and eggs, we performed an in-depth comparative quantitative label-free proteomics analysis using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry of OF and egg samples collected from the same pikeperch females. A total of 796 ovarian fluid and 1296 egg proteins were identified. The 50 most abundant proteins with prevalent protective roles were common to pikeperch OF and eggs, which may suggest that eggs are safeguarded internally and externally and can indicate functional interconnection between those two important reproductive components. A total of 624 differentially abundant proteins between OF and eggs were also identified. The proteins that were more abundant in the OF are known to actively participate in egg immunological defense, scavenge free radicals and play an important role in the restoration of immune homeostasis after inflammation and in modulating sperm performance during pikeperch fertilization. In turn, several proteins more abundant in eggs are members of signaling pathways related to extensive synthesis of maternal RNAs, proteins, and lipids that are used in oocyte maturation and fertilization, to secure antioxidant machinery against oxidative stress to maintain gamete quality and with a potential role in the regulation of meiotic cell cycle progression during oocyte maturation and its resumption following fertilization. Our results suggest that the identified OF proteins are derived from eggs, the epithelium of the ovarian cavity, blood and possibly extracellular vesicles. This OF and egg protein dataset is the largest described to date in teleost fish, which significantly extends the known protein components of female fish reproduction. Moreover, the obtained results provide a useful groundwork for future experimental approaches aimed at identifying proteins that enhance sperm motility parameters during fertilization and unraveling the content of external vesicles and their role in growth and oocyte maturation in fish.

strategies for autophagy activation and health consequences of autophagy impairment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"OBJECTIVE: Nowadays, the plague of chronic diseases, such as overweight, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, is associated with chronic inflammation as an effect of homeostasis disbalance. One of the processes involved in homeostasis maintenance is autophagy referred to as “self-eating” or “cellular recycling”. Due to the correlation between the epidemic scale of chronic diseases and autophagy impairment, the strategies for autophagy activation are urgently needed. It is worth exploring whether food ingredients and nutritional strategies contribute to the health and well-being of the organism by activating the autophagy. \nRESEARCH METHODS & PROCEDURES: In this review, we comprehensively summarized the current data about autophagy types, dysfunction, associated diseases and ways of activation available in scientific databases and published up until 2022. \nRESULTS: Our review indicates that impaired autophagy is associated with inflammatory bowel diseases, cancer, overweight, obesity, type I diabetes, diseases of the cardiovascular system, neurodegenerative diseases, depression, and anxiety. We highlight the nutritional behavior as one of the factors behind autophagy induction and homeostasis restoration. \nCONCLUSIONS: Autophagy is involved in different dysfunctions and diseases. Thus, its activation strategies are urgently needed. A high potential in the prevention and therapies of chronic diseases by means of autophagy induction can be expected from nutritional behaviors. But so far, most of the studies were carried out in vitro or in a murine model. Thus, further, well-designed clinical trials are needed to provide the missing understanding of the nutritional potential to regulate specific signaling pathways that keep the autophagy run smoothly."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5aef","5e7092e3878c28a04739ecfc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"103-104","pagesFromTo":"art. no 111686 (1-10)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e3878c28a04739ecfc","5e709411878c28a0473b5aef"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a3","mniswId":"15296","title":"Nutrition","issn":"0899-9007","documentHash":"aba0da59-a04c-4c8c-b9cc-b17c7d3ad858"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058533090"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bd4","name":"Baohong","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"398b77dd-3035-4e90-8342-2734370dfede"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bd3","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Mekhemart","documentHash":"dc7fc2ee-7bd6-4bb5-a2e3-bf6e0916187c"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bd2","name":"Vishal P.","lastName":"Deshmukh","documentHash":"04806a48-bb72-48f1-a3f6-032258ed6d93"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bd1","name":"Pran","lastName":"Mohankumar","documentHash":"f66009b3-3a4a-4717-8562-3daf7891167f"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bd0","name":"Prakash C.","lastName":"Pradhan","documentHash":"282fc616-9631-40f8-bc8d-6bb347dfc016"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bcf","name":"Abhijit","lastName":"Dey","documentHash":"17d49e24-86e0-43a5-8034-59b8ff30bd44"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bce","name":"Marisennayya","lastName":"Senapathy","documentHash":"b229c33f-d4c1-49a5-8ef7-84bfeda642ec"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bcd","name":"Ravi","lastName":"Pandiselvam","documentHash":"2bb97cbc-2d2f-421e-9fcc-2e72910e7566"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bcc","name":"Deepak","lastName":"Chandran","documentHash":"6cf85a6f-0265-45cb-8323-c04128c10539"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bcb","name":"-","lastName":"Radha","documentHash":"6bd8c927-79c0-4e57-b589-39d009b58ef8"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bca","name":"Mrunal Deepak","lastName":"Barbhai","documentHash":"110d4953-90b7-4cd7-aee3-e8b712df1f8c"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bc9","name":"Sushil","lastName":"Changan","documentHash":"5760ba66-e49d-487a-9c8e-ca0c462beee1"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bc8","name":"Aman","lastName":"Verma","documentHash":"777eecd3-ec6e-4a31-8dc0-4707a830a8e7"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bc7","name":"Nadeem","lastName":"Rais","documentHash":"08fbd2c8-22bd-4ccf-a2c7-94c518618eff"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bc6","name":"Jyoti","lastName":"Nishad","documentHash":"2c945ca1-fbcc-44e2-9ab8-c681d7e3fdc0"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bc5","name":"Sangram","lastName":"Dhumal","documentHash":"8e8e7a1d-961a-4122-a84b-b2307af9e947"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bc4","name":"Jose M.","lastName":"Lorenzo","documentHash":"fd67a068-3b22-4607-8fbb-76f492154e37"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bc3","name":"Muzaffar","lastName":"Hasan","documentHash":"49e55360-5c9e-4e9a-9734-cf5678ff365e"},{"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bc2","name":"Manoj","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"8d459594-389d-4b94-8d75-f0ca7077bd6d"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"objectId":"63aea552409707743b2e1bc1","doi":"10.1016/j.fbio.2022.102109","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Jamun (Syzygium cumini (L.)

The jamun seed is an inedible by-product of the fruit. However, their high concentration of phytochemicals makes them valuable components of nutraceuticals. Various studies on diverse biological activities of jamun seeds have warranted their application in human health and biomedical fields. This review paper discusses critically the phytochemical composition of jamun seeds and the bioactivities, including their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antidiabetic, anti-microbial, anti-obesity, hepato-protective, cardio and gastro-protective properties. The bioactivity of jamun seed is related to the presence of phenols, flavonoids, steroids, alkaloids, triterpenoids, tannins, and saponins. Animal research in vivo, and in vitro experiments with human and animal cell models support the idea that jamun seed extract can be valuable additions in food and biomedical fields due to the diverse bio-functional properties. However, in-depth and systematic in vivo clinical trials using human subjects must be conducted to confirm the safe consumption limit and establish other therapeutic roles of jamun seeds for their abundant utilization as a nutraceutical or pharmacological component. Moreover, research is required to understand the exact mechanisms of the bioactivities exhibited by jamun seeds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"50","issue":"Part B","pagesFromTo":"art. no 102109 (1-16)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aea552409707743b2e1bc2","63aea552409707743b2e1bc3","63aea552409707743b2e1bc4","63aea552409707743b2e1bc5","63aea552409707743b2e1bc6","63aea552409707743b2e1bc7","63aea552409707743b2e1bc8","63aea552409707743b2e1bc9","63aea552409707743b2e1bca","63aea552409707743b2e1bcb","63aea552409707743b2e1bcc","63aea552409707743b2e1bcd","63aea552409707743b2e1bce","63aea552409707743b2e1bcf","63aea552409707743b2e1bd0","63aea552409707743b2e1bd1","63aea552409707743b2e1bd2","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","63aea552409707743b2e1bd3","63aea552409707743b2e1bd4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c172","mniswId":"6690","title":"Food Bioscience","issn":"2212-4292","eissn":"2212-4306","documentHash":"2ee4fd05-4d70-485a-84ad-bd9a8d360367"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058533113"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11ad","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Gromadzka-Hliwa","uuid":"79FC167B3E82EF46F69D87BB67BDD43041DD1001D8AFF78D7418FC76CEE49C0C59682E556E25FE83E18E0CD2D6EA9AE70713BABD14C956D8909F10CFE9BDEF93","documentHash":"82262ed4-969b-4b21-bb13-188d73df2c6d"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11aa","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kłos","uuid":"89D30FE7040BC92B1871A1B9B420E26792C384EE94F13BB7432F4EAE5D19462249ED335D28C7968E68993B93B98AB9238849AFA8080209A2C320B29BA4348218","documentHash":"4ff16c8e-300a-4ce2-8bd6-64801af93737"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59ed","name":"Adam","lastName":"Zięcik","uuid":"2A05001C9CE3F9EC42EF983D510EA9BB69CA53C1477277343787155322B43C63CD1BB4DD3C2008215B6F0CDD006E88CCE6AE8A3C6A33A209AF9E3CD213FC6C5E","documentHash":"c1c54829-cb29-46ae-b0ef-515ad664b50a"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":"4C887615D8CF2C7AED96BBBF9BA5C5F08ED58C03893B40229F8B7BC60591947D230EB5884E4543FA7A07891B19A3B7714641EF4DB0922B7E97E35D4B3AAB996B","documentHash":"b2431fda-02ea-4ffb-9f2a-57ed6c3ab5d1"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db8b","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Likszo","uuid":"D23AB31BA061288D57FDA0E11738F95FFDD769AEC9B56313F80906BE771DC2C67C7C886A68ECF580F14B0457364855DC558082C2EA392FC4A997F6714D8087B2","documentHash":"0a426175-e277-4168-a00e-64b21a14de52"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ae9abe409707743b2dc84c","doi":"10.3390/ijms23169190","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85137668313&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Attainment of sexual maturity and gonadotropin priming in gilts determine follicular development, endocrine milieu and response to ovulatory triggers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The routine procedure of estrous cycle synchronization in pigs allows for the use of gonadotropins to stimulate ovarian activity. The applied protocols of eCG and hFSH priming similarly affected development of ovarian follicles in two classes 3–6 mm and >6 mm of diameter, however, the number of small follicles (<3 mm) was 2-fold higher in hFSH- than in eCG-primed prepubertal gilts. The attainment of sexual maturity increased concentration of estradiol, testosterone and androstenedione in the follicular fluid of hFSH/eCG-primed gilts, however, prostaglandin E2 and F2α metabolite increased in mature hFSH- and eCG-primed gilts, respectively. The maturity increased mRNA and/or protein expression of key steroidogenic enzymes, prostaglandin synthases or luteinizing hormone receptors in follicular walls. Both hormonal primers played a moderate role in affecting expression of steroidogenic enzymes in follicular walls. In vitro studies showed higher estradiol production in r-hLH (p = 0.04)- and r-hCG (p = 0.049)-stimulated follicular walls of mature gilts than in prepubertal hFSH-primed gilts. Both ovulatory triggers decreased the abundance of LHCG/FSH mRNA receptors in follicular walls, which mimic downregulation of these receptors by a preovulatory LH surge, confirmed in vivo. These data revealed the importance of sexual maturity in the protection of the estrogenic environment, and the selective, moderate role of eCG and FSH in the activation of steroidogenic enzymes in preovulatory follicles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c11ad","5e709410878c28a0473b59ed","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11aa","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89","5e7092d6878c28a04739db8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"16","pagesFromTo":"art. no 9190 (1-16)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d6878c28a04739db8b","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11ad","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11aa","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89","5e709410878c28a0473b59ed"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00c73ad49b31ccede4a01","title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES","issn":"1554-351X","documentHash":"a288b7d3-1d3d-4fa5-969b-c84261917b79"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058533183"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aea68e409707743b2e278a","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Mekhemar","documentHash":"9a410cb7-c503-4cfd-9781-170f7941cff5"},{"objectId":"63aea68e409707743b2e2789","name":"John F.","lastName":"Kennedy","documentHash":"24dfb8c0-4cba-4813-afa6-061a028103b6"},{"objectId":"63aea68e409707743b2e2788","name":"Charanjit","lastName":"Kaur","documentHash":"28a6b329-d34b-4b1a-b03c-fbeb85d9bc4f"},{"objectId":"63aea68e409707743b2e2787","name":"Marisennayya","lastName":"Senapathy","documentHash":"94908e3d-e6b8-4372-bee3-28d4b00b186a"},{"objectId":"63aea68e409707743b2e2786","name":"Surinder","lastName":"Singh","documentHash":"764ecf55-f97b-4d95-95bf-391487a3c430"},{"objectId":"63aea68e409707743b2e2785","name":"K.

The optimized conditions for Viscozyme using a Box-Behnken design (BBD) of response surface methodology (RSM) were as follow: temperature (50.2 °C), extraction time (58.4 min) and enzyme concentration (0.20%). The predicted value of anthocyanins content was 1380 mg/L, which was near to the optimized experimental value of 1375 mg/L. The extracted anthocyanins based on above mentioned conditions exhibited the lowest degradation parameters such as degradation index (DI) of (0.86), browning index of (BI) (1.31) and were characterized with cyanidin 3-sinapoylxylosylglucosylgalactoside as being the most abundant. The findings clearly reveal that Viscozyme-assisted extraction (VAE) is the best approach for extracting superior quality extracts from black carrots with high anthocyanin and other phenolic component concentrations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"163","pagesFromTo":"art. no 113528 (1-12)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aea68e409707743b2e277b","63aea68e409707743b2e277c","63aea68e409707743b2e277d","63aea68e409707743b2e277e","63aea68e409707743b2e277f","63aea68e409707743b2e2780","63aea68e409707743b2e2781","63aea68e409707743b2e2782","63aea68e409707743b2e2783","63aea68e409707743b2e2784","63aea68e409707743b2e2785","63aea68e409707743b2e2786","63aea68e409707743b2e2787","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","63aea68e409707743b2e2788","63aea68e409707743b2e2789","63aea68e409707743b2e278a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d21","mniswId":"13782","title":"LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY","issn":"0023-6438","documentHash":"65057cd0-9da3-4b12-aff8-a695b90fce69"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058533195"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ae9b4b409707743b2dc96d","name":"Alireza","lastName":"Fazeli","documentHash":"d7ea0ebe-eaa8-4531-b7ea-bb489645f26a"},{"objectId":"63ae9b4b409707743b2dc96c","name":"Kulli","lastName":"Kingo","documentHash":"02b8fdb5-36dd-41b7-beaa-2f376a5476ca"},{"objectId":"63ae9b4b409707743b2dc96b","name":"Malene","lastName":"Møller Jørgensen","documentHash":"92d2453a-a118-444e-8a19-afd5031d1ae7"},{"objectId":"63ae9b4b409707743b2dc96a","name":"Rikke","lastName":"Baek","documentHash":"a210bada-96bf-44e9-81a8-ef4ae597c2a0"},{"objectId":"63ae9b4b409707743b2dc969","name":"Paul R.","lastName":"Heath","documentHash":"46bf8daf-6d9e-4349-aa3a-521e6354fec6"},{"objectId":"63ae9b4b409707743b2dc968","name":"Janeli","lastName":"Viil","documentHash":"88a81538-e5c8-4af2-b90b-f87c52f1c80d"},{"objectId":"63ae9b4b409707743b2dc967","name":"Getnet","lastName":"Midekessa","documentHash":"cde40aed-fb92-4711-89a4-7dd0df8e3176"},{"objectId":"63ae9b4b409707743b2dc966","name":"Irina","lastName":"Guljavina","documentHash":"c4b7b1a8-daf3-4798-9d26-f3775f76b7c7"},{"objectId":"63ae9b4b409707743b2dc965","name":"Freddy","lastName":"Lättekivi","documentHash":"7c63dce8-38c5-4689-a9e7-8180fc8a2c0f"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5af0","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Andronowska","uuid":"FED2FCAE6B5DD0135A4EFBF728ABE3CD84F3632BC016B99F64D43ACE18BE814653A6357A19ED098836C69D0922559315762EE4FC0E18D9A07A5470B86F46C8AA","documentHash":"3f8bf776-486a-4bde-953d-9dc774171f3e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63ae9b4b409707743b2dc964","doi":"10.3390/ijms23074005","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85127563166&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Profiling blood serum extracellular vesicles in plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients reveals potential disease biomarkers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The routine procedure of estrous cycle synchronization in pigs allows for the use of gonadotropins to stimulate ovarian activity. The applied protocols of eCG and hFSH priming similarly affected development of ovarian follicles in two classes 3–6 mm and >6 mm of diameter, however, the number of small follicles (<3 mm) was 2-fold higher in hFSH- than in eCG-primed prepubertal gilts. The attainment of sexual maturity increased concentration of estradiol, testosterone and androstenedione in the follicular fluid of hFSH/eCG-primed gilts, however, prostaglandin E2 and F2α metabolite increased in mature hFSH- and eCG-primed gilts, respectively. The maturity increased mRNA and/or protein expression of key steroidogenic enzymes, prostaglandin synthases or luteinizing hormone receptors in follicular walls. Both hormonal primers played a moderate role in affecting expression of steroidogenic enzymes in follicular walls. In vitro studies showed higher estradiol production in r-hLH (p = 0.04)- and r-hCG (p = 0.049)-stimulated follicular walls of mature gilts than in prepubertal hFSH-primed gilts. Both ovulatory triggers decreased the abundance of LHCG/FSH mRNA receptors in follicular walls, which mimic downregulation of these receptors by a preovulatory LH surge, confirmed in vivo. These data revealed the importance of sexual maturity in the protection of the estrogenic environment, and the selective, moderate role of eCG and FSH in the activation of steroidogenic enzymes in preovulatory follicles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5af0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"art. no 4005 (1-19)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ae9b4b409707743b2dc965","63ae9b4b409707743b2dc966","63ae9b4b409707743b2dc967","63ae9b4b409707743b2dc968","63ae9b4b409707743b2dc969","63ae9b4b409707743b2dc96a","63ae9b4b409707743b2dc96b","5e709411878c28a0473b5af0","63ae9b4b409707743b2dc96c","63ae9b4b409707743b2dc96d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00c73ad49b31ccede4a01","title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES","issn":"1554-351X","documentHash":"a288b7d3-1d3d-4fa5-969b-c84261917b79"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058533301"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ae99b6409707743b2dc47b","name":"Dániel","lastName":"Fehér","documentHash":"c774ab10-0403-4063-a0c7-1a2d4e9e3ed6"},{"objectId":"63ae99b6409707743b2dc47a","name":"Flórián","lastName":"Tóth","documentHash":"9f51e9a2-64c9-426f-b2b0-0a7f3322326c"},{"objectId":"63ae99b6409707743b2dc479","name":"Gyula","lastName":"Kovács","documentHash":"5e4a352b-7c4c-4476-8297-af9c14cb3fc8"},{"objectId":"63ae99b6409707743b2dc478","name":"Zoltán","lastName":"Nagy","documentHash":"bc40f7f7-8a2d-4c15-bc9c-50c57c3d09f1"},{"objectId":"63ae99b6409707743b2dc477","name":"Georgina","lastName":"Fazekas","documentHash":"64bc31e8-863d-4d61-a671-fb421aa0a8f5"},{"objectId":"63ae99b6409707743b2dc476","name":"Uroš","lastName":"Ljubobratović","documentHash":"58c4b53e-31a5-48f0-93c8-453a99870792"},{"objectId":"5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Żarski","uuid":"C79A8111D2D012910483FF5D04C579E9FE114BBBFDBA5CB7C07AD1BEF561D1BD73734995AC49C0CF23B9AA29ACAE919DB99FD8CDFA546404CB973C5E79C1ADB2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3082-9250","documentHash":"720051ea-3868-48ad-9aab-29755a850bd5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-01-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ae99b6409707743b2dc475","doi":"10.1016/j.anireprosci.2022.106936","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85123770023&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Fish with larger pre-seasonal oocytes yields lower egg quality in season - A case study of outdoor-cultured domesticated Pikeperch (Sander lucioperca)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Seasonal reproduction of domesticated pikeperch has been the most critical spawning batch in several European countries. The present study aimed to monitor oocyte growth between mid-November and seasonal spawning to evaluate if oocyte growth trends may predict egg quality. Nineteen sexually mature females were monitored for oocyte sizes every two months. In mid-March, fish were transported to the indoor facility and artificially reproduced. Sixteen females ovulated and egg quality parameters were assessed and further related to oocyte sizes measured in November, January, and March, as well as to size increments between samplings. Based on the oocyte diameters, fish were assigned to two size groups, and the egg quality was compared. Oocyte growth was greater between the first two samplings compared to the consecutive period (150.1 ± 16.5 µm vs 24.7 ± 20.4 µm). Diameters assessed in November and March positively correlated with oil globule fragmentation, while diameters assessed in November and January positively correlated with larval malformation. Although in January larger oocytes showed better embryo survival than smaller ones (60.6 ± 9.5% vs 37.8 ± 23.2%,) they were characterized with greater percent of malformed larvae (25.0 ± 22.0% vs 5.4 ± 3.9%). It appears that fish with bigger oocytes in pre-season have an affinity toward increased embryo survival, however, they seem to have an issue with oil globule fragmentation and larvae malformation in case of seasonal spawning. Therefore, the selection of breeders for either pre-seasonal or seasonal reproduction batch according to the November oocyte size is recommended."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"238","pagesFromTo":"art. no 106936","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ae99b6409707743b2dc476","63ae99b6409707743b2dc477","63ae99b6409707743b2dc478","63ae99b6409707743b2dc479","63ae99b6409707743b2dc47a","63ae99b6409707743b2dc47b","5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477038","mniswId":"1150","title":"Animal Reproduction Science","issn":"0378-4320","eissn":"1873-2232","documentHash":"84aa4a1b-995d-49c9-b83a-db66bf4dee35"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058533409"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de10a","name":"Jose M.","lastName":"Lorenzo","documentHash":"68be5b55-d28f-4c48-bd82-7fd82fad1c14"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de109","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Mekhemar","documentHash":"f7332722-0cd6-4ee0-bbc0-a2bcd5c83853"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de108","name":"Gokhan","lastName":"Zengin","documentHash":"05ca3ad6-a2b6-4fd4-ab18-2a5b3af6b5cf"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de107","name":"Muthamilselvan","lastName":"Muthukumar","documentHash":"b05c40cd-ccce-4c2e-8d02-5e32f16cd639"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de106","name":"Kunjammal","lastName":"Pandi","documentHash":"fd7c0e93-bfba-4331-9830-53b760cd567a"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de105","name":"Marimuthu","lastName":"Subramani","documentHash":"35ae8eae-d787-48c2-b453-2b2e92ef822d"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de104","name":"Raja P.","lastName":"Ravichandran","documentHash":"cbc316c9-1dce-4063-a12b-ca9539df327a"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de103","name":"Nutan","lastName":"Pant","documentHash":"c717db2a-7954-4c2a-9c14-c601eeddacc0"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de102","name":"Surinder","lastName":"Sandhu","documentHash":"bf15d592-f25d-4c64-9adc-71771c981487"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de101","name":"Pran","lastName":"Mohankumar","documentHash":"3a3784c1-4539-4231-acfb-c141b3c317cb"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de100","name":"Sureshkumar","lastName":"Rajalingam","documentHash":"44f62848-be01-4fe9-a186-ce6580cd6389"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de0ff","name":"Niharika","lastName":"Sharma","documentHash":"c2c0247e-e39d-4d94-bd63-c5225690e2f0"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de0fe","name":"Abhijit","lastName":"Dey","documentHash":"27a05eee-6f3c-4283-a8ca-6c7ad482d151"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de0fd","name":"Deepak","lastName":"Chandran","documentHash":"c02743d3-8aec-4d7f-82e1-9eb2b8c9194f"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de0fc","name":"Neeraj","lastName":"Kumari","documentHash":"83f2f7b4-02cb-4354-b345-7b5e811ffd77"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de0fb","name":"Sonia","lastName":"Rathour","documentHash":"3445ac97-4693-490d-ad5f-d0863b3991b0"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de0fa","name":"Ashok","lastName":"Pundir","documentHash":"4fc9f559-5dde-4650-9be4-adc6af24927a"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de0f9","name":"Sunil","lastName":"Puri","documentHash":"087c57f8-0300-44f0-b0ad-c4f03dd40b1c"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de0f8","name":"Baohong","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"cb713187-7708-413c-bdc5-22ee897d9b00"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de0f7","name":"Manoj","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"bb17940d-2d4f-4431-9800-73dc7cfac103"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de0f6","name":"-","lastName":"Radha","documentHash":"d3ac2b5f-08ce-4188-8401-b9bd4abf7af2"},{"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de0f5","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kumari","documentHash":"7e8c34ea-cfc2-42c9-ab6a-eabaa30d9854"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ae9e9b409707743b2de0f4","doi":"10.3390/plants11223091","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85142411504&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Acacia catechu (L.f.)

Researchers are investigating natural products for the treatment and/or management of various infectious diseases and/or disorders. Acacia catechu (L.f.) Willd. belongs to the family Fabaceae (subfamily Mimosoideae) known as Khair or Cutch tree, possesses diverse pharmacological actions, and has been widely used in Asia and different parts of the world. The purpose of the present study is to highlight the phytochemical profile of different parts of A. catechu, the different biological activities of A. catechu extract, and the utilization of A. catechu as food and beverage. The present work constitutes a review of A. catechu; we performed searches (books, Google, Google Scholar, and Scopus publications) to compile the work/investigations made on A. catechu to the present. From our survey, it was concluded that the main phytochemicals compounds in A. catechu are protocatechuic acid, taxifolin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, catechin, epicatechin gallate, procyanidin, phloroglucin, aldobiuronic acid, gallic acid, D-galactose, afzelchin gum, L-arabinose, D-rhamnose, and quercetin. The whole plant of A. catechu possesses a comprehensive variety of medicinal potentials such as antimicrobial, antidiarrheal, antinociceptive, antihyperlipidemic, antiulcer, antioxidant, antidiabetic, antiproliferative, haemolytic, and anti-inflammatory properties due to the presence of bioactive compounds like flavonoids, alkaloids, and tannins. However, even though the plant’s metabolites were reported to have many different pharmacological uses, there is limited information about their toxicity or clinical trials. Further research on diverse metabolites of A. catechu should be carried out to ensure the safety or utilization of this plant in the pharma or food industries and in the development of potent plant-based drugs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"art. no 3091 (1-19)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ae9e9b409707743b2de0f5","63ae9e9b409707743b2de0f6","63ae9e9b409707743b2de0f7","63ae9e9b409707743b2de0f8","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","63ae9e9b409707743b2de0f9","63ae9e9b409707743b2de0fa","63ae9e9b409707743b2de0fb","63ae9e9b409707743b2de0fc","63ae9e9b409707743b2de0fd","63ae9e9b409707743b2de0fe","63ae9e9b409707743b2de0ff","63ae9e9b409707743b2de100","63ae9e9b409707743b2de101","63ae9e9b409707743b2de102","63ae9e9b409707743b2de103","63ae9e9b409707743b2de104","63ae9e9b409707743b2de105","63ae9e9b409707743b2de106","63ae9e9b409707743b2de107","63ae9e9b409707743b2de108","63ae9e9b409707743b2de109","63ae9e9b409707743b2de10a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff5e5ad49b31ccec2a87d","title":"Plants (Basel)","issn":"2223-7747","eissn":"2223-7747","documentHash":"2fbf4147-7db3-4d43-8752-472e9d758efb"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058533442"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aeb8b9409707743b2f7214","name":"Merga","lastName":"Belina","documentHash":"805facdf-1ccb-4ab4-8bb6-00d4fd4c42fc"},{"objectId":"63aeb8b9409707743b2f7213","name":"Getachew","lastName":"Bantihun","documentHash":"434c88f2-6418-4ebf-beeb-3de1a61863fe"},{"objectId":"63aeb8b9409707743b2f7212","name":"Gopal Krishan","lastName":"Sharma","documentHash":"ecd7ca87-9b1b-4867-8d39-d60defa0be0c"},{"objectId":"63aeb8b9409707743b2f7211","name":"Sartaj Ahmad","lastName":"Bhat","documentHash":"6414912b-5b1e-4195-a501-17daa8d44a72"},{"objectId":"63aeb8b9409707743b2f7210","name":"Jatinder M.","lastName":"Julka","documentHash":"a39e8e1f-8031-424c-987a-e54c435f63b2"},{"objectId":"63aeb8b9409707743b2f720f","name":"Ankeet","lastName":"Bhagat","documentHash":"39dde99a-ea20-46ae-b8a9-55004f2f5530"},{"objectId":"63aeb8b9409707743b2f720e","name":"Kasahun","lastName":"Gudeta","documentHash":"389ca39c-5ec6-4b0f-957c-249f3d5123e1"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aeb8b9409707743b2f720d","doi":"10.3390/soilsystems6040076","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Impact of aboveground vegetation on abundance, diversity, and biomass of earthworms in selected land use systems as a model of synchrony between aboveground and belowground habitats in mid-Himalaya, India","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The population status and biomass of earthworms were studied in three different land use systems of pasture (Pa), silvopasture (SP), and mixed evergreen forest (MEF) from 2019–2020 in the Solan district of Himachal Pradesh, India. The aim of this study was to assess the population status of earthworms and investigate how different land use systems influence their abundance, diversity, and biomass. Earthworms and soil were sampled using the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility (TSBF) method in all seasons (winter, spring, summer, monsoon, and autumn). The physicochemical properties of the soil were analyzed to evaluate their effects on the diversity, biomass, and density of animals. The diversity status parameters, such as the Shannon diversity index (H′), Margalef richness index (R), evenness (J′), and dominance index (D), were computed. A total of seven earthworm species, belonging to four families, namely, Amynthas corticis, Aporrectodea rosea, Drawida japonica, Eisenia fetida, Metaphire birmanica, Metaphire houlleti, and Lennogaster pusillus, were identified from all three land use systems. The lowest Shannon diversity index (H′), Margalef index (R), and evenness (J′) index values were registered in MEF (H′ = 0.661, R = 0.762, J′ = 0.369) compared to those in Pa (H′ = 1.25, R = 1.165, J′ = 0.696) and SP (H′ = 0.99, R = 0.883, J′ = 0.552), implying that MEF is the least diversified land system. In contrast, the highest dominance index (D) value was registered in MEF (Pa = 0.39, SP = 0.53, MEF = 0.67), which again showed that MEF is the least diversified land system. The highest values of abundance and biomass were recorded in MEF (754.15 individuals m−2 and 156.02 g m−2), followed by SP (306.13 individuals m−2 and 124.84 g m−2) and Pa (77.87 individuals m−2 and 31.82 g m−2). Both the density and biomass of earthworms increased from Pa to MEF (Pa < SP < MEF). This study is novel because it revealed that the diversity and productivity (biomass and abundance) values of earthworms were negatively correlated (as diversity increased, productivity decreased; as diversity decreased, productivity increased). The total values of abundance and biomass of earthworms in the three land use systems indicated perfect synchrony between aboveground and belowground habitats, whereas the diversity values revealed that MEF was dominated by one or two species and the least diversified. Therefore, for sustainable belowground productivity, aboveground conservation is recommended, and vice versa, regardless of diversity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"6","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"art  no 76 (1-20)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aeb8b9409707743b2f720e","63aeb8b9409707743b2f720f","63aeb8b9409707743b2f7210","63aeb8b9409707743b2f7211","63aeb8b9409707743b2f7212","63aeb8b9409707743b2f7213","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","63aeb8b9409707743b2f7214"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ed94","mniswId":"27452","title":"Soil Systems","issn":"2571-8789","eissn":"2571-8789","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"166ce2f3-ef68-4ebe-8f86-d48f9c4e9c23"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058533450"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb78","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Jana","uuid":"5D4B0E336E73144B09790CF99721D7DB734426CD38366D150AB2972D78FFDB81EC2C0A02BA072D3A6BFFE3A430E9249FEBAC050619876FA5E3ED772CA7E24FB7","documentHash":"29e0a18b-21f2-42e6-812f-9cf1ca486c04"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db8c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Witek","uuid":"2C277E5FD80A3685542869ABB834EEFC96FCB19A85844FD840648650CB8E9DCB4B3E1E6E62EF230BE14075E4A0E8375D3ACCD85CC5AEC73B48C2CFBCCA52E255","documentHash":"e1a5256d-3292-4679-9304-2b6a5b39c8f0"},{"objectId":"5e7091f5878c28a04738db9c","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Całka","uuid":"3594C62ED7C1B0C78E83B9B28512D72BC0E41EDDE4E97D77824392BA985EFEE9CEA61E43550910027F97F87681F54BAD215D7AED8DD9898DA32528F6986D5C5B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4679-5737","documentHash":"df4b0fea-15b1-42a0-be0b-a906195be565"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aeb4d6409707743b2ee77f","doi":"10.3390/ijms23105467","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85129888425&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Investigation of the role of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) and Its type 1 (PAC1) receptor in uterine contractility during endometritis in pigs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Uterine inflammation is a common pathology in animals, leading to disturbances in reproductive processes and reduced production profitability. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) effects at the uterine level during inflammation are not known. In the current study, we analyzed the relative PACAP type 1 receptor (PAC1R) mRNA transcript and protein abundances in the myometrium (MYO), as well s PACAP and PAC1R involvement in the contractile function of inflamed pig uterus. To that end, E. coli suspension (E. coli group) or saline (SAL group) was injected into the uterine horns or laparotomy was performed (CON group). Eight days after the bacteria injections, severe acute endometritis and a reduced relative abundance of PAC1R protein in the MYO were observed. Compared to the period before PACAP in vitro administration, PACAP (10−7 M) in the CON and SAL groups decreased in amplitude in the MYO and endometrium (ENDO)/MYO, whereas in the E. coli group, increased amplitude in the MYO and reduced amplitude in the ENDO/MYO were observed. In the E. coli group, PACAP enhanced the amplitude in the MYO (10−7 M) and decreased the amplitude in the ENDO/MYO (10−8 M) compared with other groups. PACAP (10−7 M) increased the frequency of both kinds of strips in the CON and SAL groups compared with the pretreatment period. PACAP (both doses) did not significantly change the frequency in the E. coli group, whereas in response to PACAP (10−7 M), the frequency was reduced compared to other groups. In the MYO, PAC1R antagonist decreased the amplitude reduction (CON and SAL groups) and reversed a rise in PACAP (10−7 M)-evoked amplitude (E. coli group). PAC1R blocking reversed (MYO) and abolished (ENDO/MYO) the stimulatory effect of PACAP (10−7 M) on the frequency (CON and SAL groups). PAC1R antagonist and PACAP (10−7 M) evoked the appearance of frequency depression in both kinds of strips (E. coli group). In summary, in pigs, severe acute endometritis reduces the relative abundance of PAC1R protein in the MYO, and PAC1R mediates the influence of PACAP on inflamed uterus contractility."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb78","5e7092d6878c28a04739db8c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091f5878c28a04738db9c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"art. no 5467 (1-15)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb78","5e7091f5878c28a04738db9c","5e7092d6878c28a04739db8c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00c73ad49b31ccede4a01","title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES","issn":"1554-351X","documentHash":"a288b7d3-1d3d-4fa5-969b-c84261917b79"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058533454"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc23","name":"John F.","lastName":"Kennedy","documentHash":"160ae74b-358f-4761-8528-9c5875ffd49f"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc22","name":"Suman","lastName":"Natta","documentHash":"b84bcf30-9e3c-4fbd-804c-5bb148d9e919"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc21","name":"Sangram","lastName":"Dhumal","documentHash":"e54c511d-bb6b-4ad3-b2d7-2099c0c8fce9"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc20","name":"Abhijit","lastName":"Dey","documentHash":"7252b5ed-6cb6-4345-a34d-b8f296c1826d"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc1f","name":"R.","lastName":"Pandiselvam","documentHash":"ccd570d0-1c92-4a84-8911-8f5ec3b1cb3c"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc1e","name":"Marisennayya","lastName":"Senapathy","documentHash":"65995e7b-1cd2-479a-8b77-99fbcd0ab3d4"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc1d","name":"Surinder","lastName":"Singh","documentHash":"270afa9a-2bf7-4c5b-aed0-3b7f9ed9cd88"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc1c","name":"-","lastName":"Radha","documentHash":"47a08a04-262c-4ce0-8446-67dc9cf9cb59"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc1b","name":"Ali A.S.","lastName":"Sayed","documentHash":"5db4dedc-981c-4535-8b01-7780490907c7"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc1a","name":"Samy","lastName":"Selim","documentHash":"54b7ecc5-c917-4d4a-acc2-b34954a3029f"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc19","name":"Amr","lastName":"ElKelish","documentHash":"5db39226-b759-452d-8662-95ffdb5aa4bd"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc18","name":"Sushil","lastName":"Changan","documentHash":"7850c82d-a5a3-4b28-86b9-36f6c6a51732"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc17","name":"Jayashree","lastName":"Potkule","documentHash":"dc14d2b6-89f1-4cac-bfef-89b1173fd383"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc16","name":"Vivek","lastName":"Saurabh","documentHash":"f8523b0a-00e6-476c-ba84-7bea25b089cd"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc15","name":"José M.","lastName":"Lorenzo","documentHash":"f212e6e8-3ca4-4209-90a7-4dd4a516c7cf"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc14","name":"Mrunal D.","lastName":"Barbhai","documentHash":"7b78e0a3-65cd-4dae-8044-4698cc2b0fcb"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc13","name":"Swati","lastName":"Kapoor","documentHash":"9ca76077-511c-4ebd-b339-d459331f0262"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc12","name":"Pavidharshini","lastName":"Selvasekaran","documentHash":"ab2c867c-31be-4e7b-82f4-3a5a24d96663"},{"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc11","name":"Manoj","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"d3b61e27-8a93-4967-9c2c-2275868c09d5"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"objectId":"63aea2e0409707743b2dfc10","doi":"10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.107791","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85133963475&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Moringa oleifera Lam. seed proteins: Extraction, preparation of protein hydrolysates, bioactivities, functional food properties, and industrial application","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Moringa oleifera Lam. (Moringaceae) consumed in several tropical and subtropical countries is a highly valued multi-purpose herbal plant with numerous medicinal properties and high nutritional value.

The objective of the current review is to highlight the recent developments in the various protein extraction methods and preparation of protein hydrolysates from moringa seeds. The recent findings on the bioactivities, functional properties, and industrial applications of moringa seed proteins are noteworthy. Therefore, the study was framed to discuss relevant research reports in six sections viz-moringa seed protein extraction, moringa seed protein isolates/hydrolysates, amino acid profile, functional properties, bioactivities, and food or biomedical industrial applications. Moringa seed proteins exhibited antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiviral, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, anticancer, and cardio-protective activity. Moringa seed protein isolates revealed good foaming capacity and stability, emulsification capacity, water, and oil absorption capacity. Industrially moringa seed protein isolates could be potentially used as milk coagulant, thickening agent, food and feed ingredient, and drug delivery agent.

Moreover, we examined the effects of dinoprost, injected intra-CL or administered intramuscularly (IM), on CL secretory function and on indicators of CL vascular network status: luteal tissue area (LTA), CL blood flow (CLBF), and the CLBF:LTA ratio (Adj. CLBF), in cows at the early and mid-luteal phases. In the Experiment 1, cows (day 10 of the cycle) were allocated to (i) an intra-CL injection of saline (control; n = 3); (ii) an intra-CL injection of dinoprost (1.25 mg; 2.5 mg, or 5 mg; n = 3 for each dose); (iii) an IM administration of saline (control; n = 3); or (iv) an IM administration of dinoprost (25 mg; positive control; n = 3). Concentrations of OT and P4 were measured in plasma samples. The mRNA expression of steroidogenesis- or necroptosis-related factors was determined in CL tissue 4 h after treatments. In Experiment 2, cows on day 4 (n = 12) or day 10 (n = 12) were allocated to (i) an intra-CL injection of dinoprost (2.5 mg/0.5 ml; n = 6), or (ii) IM administration of dinoprost (25 mg/5 ml; n = 6). Concentrations of P4 were measured in plasma samples. Luteal tissue area, CLBF, and Adj. CLBF were assessed based on color Doppler ultrasonography. An intra-CL injection of dinoprost increased OT and decreased P4 levels in the jugular vein (JV) in a dose-dependent manner in cows at the mid-luteal phase. Increased CLBF and Adj. CLBF, accompanied by reduced P4 levels, were observed 2 h after intra-CL dinoprost injection in middle-stage CL. Decreased STAR and increased RIPK1 and RIPK3 mRNA levels confirmed that 2.5 mg dinoprost injected directly into CL is the minimum dose that induces luteolytic cascade. Injection of dinoprost directly into the CL (at a dosage lower than recommended for peripheral application) results in a pattern similar to IM dinoprost administration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709381878c28a0473ab804","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","5e709405878c28a0473b503d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","pagesFromTo":"art. no 811809 (1-12)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709381878c28a0473ab804","5e709405878c28a0473b503d","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb3","mniswId":"22511","title":"Frontiers in Veterinary Science","eissn":"2297-1769","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b55ea41a-42fc-4944-8655-5f96bf0a9101"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058533796"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df794","name":"John F.","lastName":"Kennedy","documentHash":"1d91baa0-e88d-4ac5-9bed-72600e28dc96"},{"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df793","name":"Ahmad","lastName":"Alhariri","documentHash":"64ef76f5-cc26-4a40-a796-6a6843e4f413"},{"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df792","name":"Omar","lastName":"Alajil","documentHash":"7c356142-6f58-4b77-bc97-6280bda332b6"},{"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df791","name":"T.","lastName":"Anitha","documentHash":"893ffb8b-4036-43a9-a468-53b017d468fe"},{"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df790","name":"Bharat","lastName":"Bhushan","documentHash":"e31fea8b-5eb6-4b9d-b235-b471d995c15d"},{"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df78f","name":"Prakash C.","lastName":"Pradhan","documentHash":"34a98e16-443a-4937-b0d3-bb67288feeef"},{"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df78e","name":"Sangram","lastName":"Dhumal","documentHash":"de5931bd-3997-43e4-ba31-261aac6a0a67"},{"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df78d","name":"Surinder","lastName":"Singh","documentHash":"f0c56fab-5100-47cb-b400-3b80a33eb8b5"},{"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df78c","name":"Jyoti","lastName":"Dhakane","documentHash":"8073633a-df39-4e64-bff8-79df6fdbe6f0"},{"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df78b","name":"Sneh","lastName":"Punia","documentHash":"63be64cb-f1a9-4fdf-8798-77554fdfc485"},{"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df78a","name":"-","lastName":"Reetu","documentHash":"ac72380a-3bb8-436b-bdb7-cdd7710dfc81"},{"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df789","name":"Jayashree","lastName":"Potkule","documentHash":"ee4f6d2d-1e33-46a6-ac46-5b5c9c19af41"},{"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df788","name":"Maharishi","lastName":"Tomar","documentHash":"7d5fbfe2-cb87-4632-81af-2a45aa9c43f6"},{"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df787","name":"Manoj","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"8b217556-7d06-4546-9721-21133ba62fdc"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"objectId":"63aea21b409707743b2df786","doi":"10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.106986","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85114190886&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Functional characterization of plant-based protein to determine its quality for food applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Protein plays a role as an indispensable macronutrient in human nutrition. The utilization of new protein sources from plants requires a thorough investigation for application in foods. Functional characterization is the most important step for the quality assessment of protein along with annotating the protein with a specific application in food systems. The evaluation of plant protein for quality and functional properties is critical in replacing conventional animal-based proteins. This review aims to discuss the important parameters considered crucial for the application of protein in foods. The amino acid profile is the most important parameter for the evaluation of the quality of a protein, while others (viz., molecular weight distribution, structural morphology, and thermal stability) are crucial properties of the protein. This review also focuses on various food functional properties (water/oil holding capacity, emulsification activity/stability, and solubility) and in vitro digestibility, which are considered important for identifying a distinct application for a particular plant protein. Research trends show numerous emerging sources of quality plant proteins, but their utilization as food supplements depends on their availability, safety, and consumer preferences. However, advancements in techniques for functional characterization could assist in exploring new plant protein sources that can be utilized in human nutrition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"123","pagesFromTo":"art. no 106986 (1-20)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aea21b409707743b2df787","63aea21b409707743b2df788","63aea21b409707743b2df789","63aea21b409707743b2df78a","63aea21b409707743b2df78b","63aea21b409707743b2df78c","63aea21b409707743b2df78d","63aea21b409707743b2df78e","63aea21b409707743b2df78f","63aea21b409707743b2df790","63aea21b409707743b2df791","63aea21b409707743b2df792","63aea21b409707743b2df793","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","63aea21b409707743b2df794"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477d13","mniswId":"6696","title":"FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS","issn":"0268-005X","documentHash":"7824f169-274c-4b49-b141-2fe99fe0b21c"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058533835"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aed21c409707743b317ff8","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Jesiołowski","documentHash":"92ad6e57-6aa0-4a2f-8b2c-fa3ff9060fc0"},{"objectId":"63aed21c409707743b317ff7","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Ilgert","documentHash":"0db32e4a-5be7-4226-b347-8a4972402a95"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11d8","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dryl","uuid":"C7E9CB8F81587D9545DA8D8E2EF5DDE7CF1A9FAAE9C0299B7B04E8F997057B7F9352D620BBDFB0AFC4C85B242EE6A6CCC84BF490876D3C7B60F72040E1167FD4","documentHash":"d1985492-fa27-4aaf-8425-eabaf0d9b9cd"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a3e","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"E6653CD78C8754EF7BFD95E57DE5E087BF7A36AB665933A9BAC1A715F746088C182B965CE79BC1C7F02A0EA7D23ECAAE9E04D1192C0A3B46E6C4CE19330E6053","orcidId":"0000-0002-0251-8626","documentHash":"aeb9ef0c-8778-46b7-9db1-66e9b2204884"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59ea","name":"Beata","lastName":"Sarosiek","uuid":"FECD4D4B853FBEF401B28C7FF05015725799EB4D0EF7419C618F18659F403338E96727C308048755873035C4CCECC836104003D97BAEE08D9BECE063111087E7","documentHash":"cbc178b6-7640-40bf-8b84-9922438a49c6"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588d","name":"BEATA","lastName":"CEJKO","uuid":"CF523C6A81E8B12F45AC952CAEC80BB85387D3F9D5C4A1D1CB73D3958973358EA8FC2B57B13E70E4D6516D099CEB9DAB530C827B4AF53785E8A3800EF3C1FFB3","documentHash":"d521c9d6-a457-4e4b-b91b-bce0ffcae09d"}],"objectId":"63aed21c409707743b317ff6","doi":"10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738491","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85132231953&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Application of sodium alginate solution for short-term storage of different volumes of sex-reversed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) testicular sperm","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The effect of 0.8% sodium alginate (alginate) addition to Morisawa solution (MS) at pH 8.5 containing 100 mM NaCl, 40 mM KCl, 3 mM CaCl2, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM Tris supplemented with an antibiotic (10,000 units penicillin and 10 mg streptomycin per mL in 0.9%) on sex-reversed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) short-term sperm storage for 12 days under anaerobic conditions (4 °C) was tested. Sex-reversed rainbow trout sperm, i.e., testicular sperm (TS), was diluted tenfold in MS + alginate (1:9; TS:MS + alginate) and short-term stored in different containers: an microtube (Mt) with 500 μl capacity, a glass container (Gc) with a 25 ml capacity and a plastic container (Pc) with a 120 ml capacity. In each storage container, TS was short-term stored in sperm columns at two different heights, 0.5 cm (sperm storage volume: 180 μl, 4 ml and 9 ml for Mt., Gc and Pc, respectively) and 1.0 cm (sperm storage volume: 200 μl, 8 ml and 18 ml for Mt., Gc and Pc, respectively). As a control, TS diluted in MS without alginate addition was applied, and sperm were stored for a short time under the same conditions, i.e., storage time, dilution ratio, containers and sperm column height. During the experiment, sperm motility (MOT, %) and sperm curvilinear velocity (VCL, μm s−1) were analyzed at 0, 4, 8 and 12 days during TS short-term storage. It was found that the efficiency of short-term storage of sex-reversed rainbow trout TS was determined both by the sperm column height used (stored sperm volume) and by the addition of MS supplements limiting sperm sedimentation during storage, i.e., 0.8% sodium alginate. Over 12 days, the best storage effects (based on CASA parameters) were obtained when TS was short-term stored in Pc using a 9 ml sperm volume, regardless of alginate addition to MS. In contrast, in Mt. (180 and 200 μl sperm storage volume), TS lost its ability to move more quickly, i.e., on the 4th day, mainly in short-term trials without the addition of alginate. The results also indicate that incorporation of alginate into MS significantly reduces TS sedimentation and enhances fertilization capacity during short-term storage over 12 days, especially at a 1.0 cm sperm column height, i.e., using 200 μl, 8 ml and 18 ml sperm volumes for short-term storage in Mt., Gc and Pc, respectively."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c11d8","5e70940d878c28a0473b588d","5e709410878c28a0473b59ea","5e709410878c28a0473b5a3e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"560","pagesFromTo":"art. no 738491 (1-9)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940d878c28a0473b588d","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11d8","5e709410878c28a0473b59ea","63aed21c409707743b317ff7","63aed21c409707743b317ff8","5e709410878c28a0473b5a3e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547715a","mniswId":"1539","title":"Aquaculture","issn":"0044-8486","eissn":"1873-5622","documentHash":"aaff1260-3172-4786-b919-d851b47a7a44"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058536675"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aebe83409707743b2fdec9","name":"Fatih","lastName":"Oz","documentHash":"57366d4c-3d68-4015-96bd-e0456206c856"},{"objectId":"63aebe83409707743b2fdec8","name":"Emad","lastName":"Karrar","documentHash":"9b6f2cfb-08ce-43bc-9e3b-64afadbc6c38"},{"objectId":"63aebe83409707743b2fdec7","name":"Charalampos","lastName":"Proestos","documentHash":"dd4d9239-ce84-49ef-bd3e-45f23252b1b8"},{"objectId":"63aebe83409707743b2fdec6","name":"Emel","lastName":"Oz","documentHash":"acb1ad89-d1d4-44d5-843c-01fba2d3d5a2"},{"objectId":"63aebe83409707743b2fdec5","name":"Ahmad Abdelkaway","lastName":"Abdelaal","documentHash":"e93f1bcf-124e-4961-bdbd-6c2b20839ac7"},{"objectId":"63aebe83409707743b2fdec4","name":"Elham Abdelrahman","lastName":"Basiouny","documentHash":"a8b267fc-2762-4043-95d1-ab8e646ebbb2"},{"objectId":"63aebe83409707743b2fdec3","name":"Tahra","lastName":"ElObeid","documentHash":"3be4c8fd-b311-4a49-9e25-c069ff955b9c"},{"objectId":"63aebe83409707743b2fdec2","name":"Ayman Younes","lastName":"Allam","documentHash":"d8aeb527-65c4-4cc2-9455-168af058f234"},{"objectId":"63aebe83409707743b2fdec1","name":"Aly","lastName":"Farag El Sheikha","documentHash":"64d69697-ee44-4432-b702-3a9cceda8b26"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63aebe83409707743b2fdec0","doi":"10.3390/antiox11061191","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85132017959&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Impact of a carboxymethyl cellulose coating incorporated with an ethanolic propolis extract on the quality criteria of chicken breast meat","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Recently, the demand for composite edible coatings has increased significantly as a new trend to confront the serious processing and storage problems that always arise regarding chicken meat.

Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) are involved in collagen turnover. Since epigenetic changes may control fibroproliferative diseases, we hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms could modulate equine endometrosis. Epigenetic changes can be reversed and therefore extremely promising for therapeutic use. Methylation pattern analysis of a particular gene zone is used to detect epigenetic changes. DNA methylation commonly mediates gene repression. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate if the transcription of some genes involved in equine endometrosis was altered with endometrial fibrosis, and if the observed changes were epigenetically modulated, through DNA methylation analysis. Endometrial biopsies collected from cyclic mares were histologically classified (Kenney and Doig category I, n = 6; category IIA, n = 6; category IIB, n = 6 and category III, n = 6). Transcription of COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, MMP2, MMP9, TIMP1, and TIMP2 genes and DNA methylation pattern by pyrosequencing of COL1A1, MMP2, MMP9, TIMP1 genes were evaluated. Both MMP2 and MMP9 transcripts decreased with fibrosis, when compared with healthy endometrium (category I) (P < 0.05). TIMP1 transcripts were higher in category III, when compared to category I endometrium (P < 0.05). No differences were found for COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1 and TIMP2 transcripts between endometrial categories. There were higher methylation levels of (i) COL1A1 in category IIB (P < 0.05) and III (P < 0.01), when compared to category I; (ii) MMP2 in category III, when compared to category I (P < 0.001) and IIA (P < 0.05); and (iii) MMP9 in category III, when compared to category I and IIA (P < 0.05). No differences in TIMP1 methylation levels were observed between endometrial categories. The hypermethylation of MMP2 and MMP9, but not of COL1A1 genes, occurred simultaneously with a decrease in their mRNA levels, with endometrial fibrosis, suggesting that this hypermethylation is responsible for repressing their transcription. Our results show that endometrosis is epigenetically modulated by anti-fibrotic genes (MMP2 and MMP9) inhibition, rather than fibrotic genes activation and therefore, might be promising targets for therapeutic use."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"art. no 970003 (1-13)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aed6be409707743b31b1d8","63aed6be409707743b31b1d9","63aed6be409707743b31b1da","63aed6be409707743b31b1db","63aed6be409707743b31b1dc","63aed6be409707743b31b1dd","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","63aed6be409707743b31b1de"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb3","mniswId":"22511","title":"Frontiers in Veterinary Science","eissn":"2297-1769","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b55ea41a-42fc-4944-8655-5f96bf0a9101"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058540083"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aed62b409707743b31adce","name":"Graça","lastName":"Ferreira-Dias","documentHash":"f38ba0f3-571e-402a-abeb-8792bcda2047"},{"objectId":"63aed62b409707743b31adcd","name":"Telmo","lastName":"Nunes","documentHash":"e705ed4e-4454-4b52-9015-021f6eb6effb"},{"objectId":"63aed62b409707743b31adcc","name":"Miguel","lastName":"Bliebernicht","documentHash":"363cb2d4-ad70-4f78-8878-50844a9c8a45"},{"objectId":"63aed62b409707743b31adcb","name":"Ana L.","lastName":"Costa","documentHash":"910eeee5-3c56-4dd9-9003-4820a0a75ce5"},{"objectId":"63aed62b409707743b31adca","name":"Maria R.","lastName":"Rebordão","documentHash":"02b013c9-adfe-4838-99cb-94df36ca6572"},{"objectId":"63aed62b409707743b31adc9","name":"Carina","lastName":"Fernandes","documentHash":"4f30c082-8609-4f1b-a1e8-8baa9c544c25"},{"objectId":"63aed62b409707743b31adc8","name":"Joana","lastName":"Alpoim-Moreira","documentHash":"7873fe83-5be1-46f3-838e-ca7f6702c3bd"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Skarżyński","uuid":"893E2C4B87695FF9AC23B84616C654F5B1E6FC9D903BB90BDCE1C38DABAFE563D8799DF0E9B5E427AD9DE60E48421A2744D5C1C29108A61057E0DC537A800774","orcidId":"0000-0001-9537-3560","documentHash":"f2e476d8-aceb-487d-b95e-e46c79fa4e0b"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szóstek-Mioduchowska","uuid":"967AF197FAE274F7A3920BD12A655DA90CD1F8A691C090E35027D38FA489D9F3DD09D69E31DFB0A2C53148A67D83239257109137F7D6023AC24209FF207A256C","documentHash":"585d4348-5759-42bf-9e5e-134716588ad9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63aed62b409707743b31adc7","doi":"10.3390/ani12141854","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85136239684&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Collagen type III as a possible blood biomarker of fibrosis in equine endometrium","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In the mare, endometrosis is a disease characterized by excessive collagen fibers deposition in the endometrium (uterus inner layer), which is responsible for infertility. The gold standard method for endometrosis evaluation has been endometrial biopsy histopathological classification. The use of blood biomarkers for endometrosis identification would be less invasive, and could provide additional information regarding endometrosis diagnosis and fertility prognosis. Therefore, this study aimed to identify possible blood biomarkers for endometrosis diagnosis and fertility assessment on mares. Reproductive examination, endometrial biopsy histopathological classification, and blood collection were performed. Endometrium and serum collagen type I (COL1) and type III (COL3), and hydroxyproline concentrations were determined. In conclusion, serum COL3 concentration might be considered as a potential aid for the diagnosis of endometrosis and fertility prognosis in the mare. In contrast, COL1 and hydroxyproline did not prove to be effective as biomarkers of endometrial fibrosis in this species. Although it is very unlikely that a single blood biomarker could replace a histopathological evaluation, serum COL3 may have clinical applications. Thus, it may be useful to evaluate a group of mares as possible recipients in embryo transfer programs, where performing endometrial biopsies of several mares is not feasible. ABSTRACT: Collagen pathological deposition in equine endometrium (endometrosis) is responsible for infertility. Kenney and Doig’s endometrial biopsy histopathological classification is the gold standard method for endometrosis evaluation, whereby blood biomarkers identification would be less invasive and could provide additional information regarding endometrosis diagnosis and fertility prognosis. This study aimed to identify blood biomarkers for endometrosis diagnosis (42 mares were used in experiment 1), and fertility assessment (50 mares were used in experiment 2). Reproductive examination, endometrial biopsy histopathological classification (Kenney and Doig) and blood collection were performed. Endometrium and serum collagen type I (COL1) and type III (COL3), and hydroxyproline concentrations were measured (ELISA). Serum COL3 cut-off value of 60.9 ng/mL allowed healthy endometria (category I) differentiation from endometria with degenerative/fibrotic lesions (categories IIA, IIB or III) with 100% specificity and 75.9% sensitivity. This cut-off value enabled category I + IIA differentiation from IIB + III (76% specificity, 81% sensitivity), and category III differentiation from others (65% specificity, 92.3% sensitivity). COL1 and hydroxyproline were not valid as blood biomarkers. Serum COL3 cut-off value of 146 ng/mL differentiated fertile from infertile mares (82.4% specificity, 55.6% sensitivity), and was not correlated with mares’ age. Only COL3 may prove useful as a diagnostic aid in mares with endometrial fibrosis and as a fertility indicator."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"art. no 1854 (1-14)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aed62b409707743b31adc8","63aed62b409707743b31adc9","63aed62b409707743b31adca","63aed62b409707743b31adcb","63aed62b409707743b31adcc","63aed62b409707743b31adcd","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","63aed62b409707743b31adce"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058540402"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61d49f9b2467f0627d259ef6","name":"Vanessa D.","lastName":"Capriles","documentHash":"ee46dbda-f09e-4ceb-9185-84ad51056b23"},{"objectId":"61d49f9b2467f0627d259ef4","name":"Fernarda G.","lastName":"Santos","documentHash":"c3a5e12c-006d-48df-9f56-5ac1fb4d8202"},{"objectId":"61d49f9b2467f0627d259ef3","name":"Etiene V.","lastName":"Aguiar","documentHash":"c2d3d2f5-2cb7-4bdd-ac55-a3cf41be9d95"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b590c","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Krupa-Kozak","uuid":"824046190EE24412796A8810E9411D9CE05BF23BC9D270DAA5BCB208C989366F8E808ACA30C1F7DF5E6D86B3E899878705B2F6E7827CB1232D8102AD21736584","documentHash":"5eb3692a-f31e-4173-b6e9-435b4fba6984"}],"objectId":"61d49f9b2467f0627d259ef1","doi":"10.1080/10408398.2021.1952403","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.1952403","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Nutritional facts regarding commercially available gluten-free bread worldwide: Recent advances and future challenges","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Recently, there has been an increase in demand for gluten-free (GF) products due to the growing number of gluten-intolerant and healthy individuals choosing to follow a gluten-free diet. Gluten-free bread (GFB) is a staple food product; therefore, many recent studies have reported the nutritional properties of GFB. However, an overview of the current ingredients and nutritional labeling of GFB worldwide has not yet been provided. This review aimed to gather the latest information regarding the most used ingredients in GFB formulations and the nutritional quality of these products from different countries, based on studies published in the last decade (2010–2020). Our analysis showed that GFB had a lower protein and a higher fat content than gluten-containing bread, and the dietary fiber content was highly variable between countries. Some studies have revealed a high glycaemic index in most products, which is associated with the extensive use of rice flour and starch as the main ingredients in GFB formulation. Label information presented significant differences from the data obtained through the chemical analysis of fiber and other nutritional components. Micronutrient fortification is not common in the GFB. The nutritional quality of commercial GFB is a crucial issue that needs to be addressed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej

neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are formed. Besides myeloperoxidase activity against pathogens, it was also linked to many diseases, including inflammatory and fibrotic ones. Endometrosis is a fibrotic disease of the mare endometrium, with a large impact on their fertility, where myeloperoxidase was shown to induce fibrosis. Noscapine is an alkaloid with a low toxicity, that has been studied as an anti-cancer drug, and more recently as an anti-fibrotic molecule. This work aims to evaluate noscapine inhibition of collagen type 1 (COL1) induced by myeloperoxidase in equine endometrial explants from follicular and mid-luteal phases, at 24 and 48 h of treatment. The transcription of collagen type 1 alpha 2 chain (COL1A2), and COL1 protein relative abundance were evaluated by qPCR and Western blot, respectively. The treatment with myeloperoxidase increased COL1A2 mRNA transcription and COL1 protein, whereas noscapine was able to reduce this effect with respect to COL1A2 mRNA transcription, in a time/estrous cycle phase-dependent manner (in explants from the follicular phase, at 24 h of treatment). Our study indicates that noscapine is a promising drug to be considered as an anti-fibrotic molecule to prevent endometrosis development, making noscapine a strong candidate to be applied in future endometrosis therapies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w

sequencing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\r\nAlthough, oocytes from prepubertal donors are known to be less developmentally competent than those from adult donors it does not restrain their ability to produce full-term pregnancies. The transcriptomic profile of embryos could be used as a predictor for embryo’s individual developmental competence. The aim of the study was to compare transcriptomic profile of blastocysts derived from prepubertal and pubertal heifers oocytes. Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were obtained by ovum pick- up method from prepubertal and pubertal heifers. After in vitro maturation COCs were fertilized and cultured to the blastocyst stage. Total RNA was isolated from both groups of blastocysts and RNA-seq was performed. Gene ontology analysis was performed by DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery).\r\n\r\nResults\r\nA higher average blastocyst rate was obtained in the pubertal than in the pre-pubertal group. There were no differences in the quality of blastocysts between the examined groups. We identified 436 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between blastocysts derived from researched groups, of which 247 DEGs were downregulated in blastocysts derived from pubertal compared to prepubertal heifers oocytes, and 189 DEGs were upregulated. The genes involved in mitochondrial function, including oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) were found to be different in studied groups using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes (KEGG) pathway analysis and 8 of those DEGs were upregulated and 1 was downregulated in blastocysts derived from pubertal compared to prepubertal heifers oocytes. DEGs associated with mitochondrial function were found: ATP synthases (ATP5MF-ATP synthase membrane subunit f, ATP5PD- ATP synthase peripheral stalk subunit d, ATP12A- ATPase H+/K?+?transporting non-gastric alpha2 subunit), NADH dehydrogenases (NDUFS3- NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit core subunit S3, NDUFA13- NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A13, NDUFA3- NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A3), cytochrome c oxidase (COX17), cytochrome c somatic (CYCS) and ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase core protein 1 (UQCRC1). We found lower number of apoptotic cells in blastocysts derived from oocytes collected from prepubertal than those obtained from pubertal donors.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nDespite decreased expression of genes associated with OXPHOS pathway in blastocysts from prepubertal heifers oocytes, the increased level of ATP12A together with the lower number of apoptotic cells in these blastocysts might support their survival after transfer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","uid":"biMkjldDwyEilXl7rx-ushQ","uuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","name":"Instytut Zootechniki - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709409878c28a0473b5471","5e709439878c28a0473b8733"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","parentUuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","rootUuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7da9","5e709442878c28a0473b910d","6350b2a9752340623bbeb37c","60c31a1b9543c72336543d07","5e7093b2878c28a0473af55c","5e70945e878c28a0473bb92a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"2-20","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c31a1b9543c72336543d07","5e709430878c28a0473b7da9","5e709442878c28a0473b910d","5e70945e878c28a0473bb92a","6350b2a9752340623bbeb37c","66cedd95fdbe832737f608b4","66cedd95fdbe832737f608b5","5e709409878c28a0473b5471","5e709439878c28a0473b8733","66cedd95fdbe832737f608b6","5e7093b2878c28a0473af55c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773cd","mniswId":"2618","title":"BMC Genomics","issn":"1471-2164","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2ff287d7-1a10-467c-a75f-c1521bd09d11"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66cedd95fdbe832737f608af","year":"2024","volume":"25","number":"632","documentHash":"a73e0d94-f6e4-4f0c-8634-0829561fce1a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Prepubertal heifer","Mitochondria","Next-generation sequencing","Blastocyst","Cow"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060265020"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67695e73fdbe8317b9a26d07","name":"Otomar","lastName":"Linhart","documentHash":"7df6b662-7a91-4ef2-9652-07cf1f28bca7"},{"objectId":"67695e73fdbe8317b9a26d06","name":"Catherinef","lastName":"Labbé","documentHash":"19443c97-8c7b-4cde-a9a3-d058f76bb56e"},{"objectId":"67695e73fdbe8317b9a26d05","name":"Sayyed M.

Induced aging by short-term storage has been shown to affect fish spermatozoa phenotypes including morphology and motility kinetics. However, its effects on epigenetics of sperm and the resulting embryos have not been investigated. In the present study, sperm of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) was stored in vivo and/or in vitro using an extender, and spermatozoa motility kinetics, viability, and epigenetics were analyzed. We observed that spermatozoa motility and velocity decreased following in vivo and/or in vitro storage from 3 to 6.5 days, but spermatozoa viability remained stable. At the same time, global DNA methylation, DNA hydroxymethylation, and specific histone acetylation and methylation were not affected by sperm aging. Further analysis showed no variation in global DNA methylation during embryogenesis when short-term stored sperm in the extender was used for fertilization compared with embryos produced from fresh sperm. The results suggest the reliability of short-term storage of sperm using an extender in fertilization and the production of the next generation of embryos. However, larval growth and performance need to be elucidated for these fish. This study has shed light on the potential application of extenders in storage of sperm in common carp breeding programs to manage selection, genomic manipulation and genetic resources conservation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a40"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"571","pagesFromTo":"art. no 739484 (1-14)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67695e73fdbe8317b9a26cfa","67695e73fdbe8317b9a26cfb","67695e73fdbe8317b9a26cfc","67695e73fdbe8317b9a26cfd","67695e73fdbe8317b9a26cfe","67695e73fdbe8317b9a26cff","67695e73fdbe8317b9a26d00","67695e73fdbe8317b9a26d01","67695e73fdbe8317b9a26d02","67695e73fdbe8317b9a26d03","5e709410878c28a0473b5a40","67695e73fdbe8317b9a26d04","67695e73fdbe8317b9a26d05","67695e73fdbe8317b9a26d06","67695e73fdbe8317b9a26d07"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547715a","mniswId":"1539","title":"Aquaculture","issn":"0044-8486","eissn":"1873-5622","documentHash":"aaff1260-3172-4786-b919-d851b47a7a44"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060268102"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e63aafdbe8322e23bbe3f","name":"Halina","lastName":"Kaczmarek","documentHash":"8b0f36ee-f56b-4752-9264-3ee053c60721"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be65a","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Mikuła","uuid":"0C06918C90F78E41E4A026A7C0CAE1609BEFC7A66903F7CD9C43E0A70ACDE5F9D00A42773075FCCC2AFB010AFC1EB11C09CA8F6A959F9DF4F51CEAFDA3C9D24E","documentHash":"703241b4-87b9-4f20-a6ad-3907d38e870a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e63aafdbe8322e23bbe3e","doi":"10.2174/092986733008221215111423","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85147440052&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Aptamer-based biosensors for biomarkers detection (Part II)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947f878c28a0473be65a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","pagesFromTo":"893-894","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947f878c28a0473be65a","676e63aafdbe8322e23bbe3f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477885","mniswId":"4720","title":"Current Medicinal Chemistry","issn":"0929-8673","eissn":"1875-533X","documentHash":"b5aea0ba-040f-4bd8-9057-f1a609e6b2f8"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060268133"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67779c0efdbe833ec1c80925","name":"Molnár","lastName":"Ferdinand","documentHash":"21c43631-a528-4276-b6b9-9c0c0d60d57b"},{"objectId":"67779c0efdbe833ec1c80924","name":"Velleuer","lastName":"Eunike","documentHash":"21b1923a-2e2c-4745-9c9a-458ff402b52a"},{"objectId":"6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","name":"Carsten","lastName":"Carlberg","uuid":"7A3E0E7963E1192270F3903EEFFAA1A086E27754D1B393FD104F68B8A691171F30A075FDFF073A66B06C35CCE685244FF4287E47226B5FB73CCE42A85608CA83","documentHash":"50649f30-9531-42e7-8c6c-543c2bbfecb8"}],"objectId":"67779c0efdbe833ec1c80923","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-27133-5","type":"BOOK","typeName":"Książka","year":2023,"title":"Molecular Meidicine.

Starting with the understanding of gene regulation and epigenetics, i.e., the interplay of transcription factors and chromatin, this book will provide an fundamental basis of nearly all processes in physiology, both in health as well as in most common disorders, such as cancer, diabetes as well as in autoimmune diseases. Most non-communicable human diseases have a genetic (= inherited) as well as an epigenetic component. The later one is based on our lifestyle choices and environmental exposures. Many common diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, can be explained only to some 20% via a genetic predisposition. We cannot change the genes that we are born with but we can take care of the remaining 80% being primarily based on our epigenome. Therefore, there is a high level of individual responsibility for staying healthy. Thus, not only biologists and biochemists should be aware of this topic, but all students of biomedical disciplines will benefit from being introduced into the concepts of molecular medicine. This will provide them with a good basis for their specialized disciplines of modern life science research. The book is subdivided into 42 chapters that are linked to a series of lecture courses in “Molecular Medicine and Genetics”, “Molecular Immunology”, “Cancer Biology” and “Nutrigenomics” that is given by one of us (C. Carlberg) in different forms since 2002 at the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio. This book represents an updated version and fusion of the books textbooks “Mechanisms of Gene Regulation: How Science Works” (ISBN 978-3-030-52321-3), “Human Epigenetics: How Science Works” (ISBN 978-3-030-22907-8). “Molecular Immunology: How Science Works” (ISBN 978-3-031-04024-5), “Cancer Biology: How Science Works” (ISBN 978-3-030-75699-4) and “Nutrigenomics: How Science Works” (ISBN 978-3-030-36948-4). By combining basic understanding of cellular mechanism with clinical examples, the authors hope to make this textbook a personal experience. A glossary in the appendix will explain the major specialist’s terms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","67779c0efdbe833ec1c80924","67779c0efdbe833ec1c80925"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"978-3-031-27132-8","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5ec0043fad49b31cced7e7c2","name":"Springer Nature","documentHash":"da41b6ee-b7a0-41df-8b61-c1bb76501273"},"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cancer","nutrition","epigenetics","immunology","physiology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060268169"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e7130fdbe8322e23bf357","name":"Serkan","lastName":"Selli","documentHash":"4d402dab-c7ee-4427-b549-864f3cb1a6f7"},{"objectId":"676e7130fdbe8322e23bf356","name":"Hasim","lastName":"Kelebek","documentHash":"1735f07a-bddc-412c-90ff-ef0a42b2c4bb"},{"objectId":"676e7130fdbe8322e23bf355","name":"Onur","lastName":"Sevindik","documentHash":"c6a03fa6-9964-4249-8ce0-cc09565d820c"},{"objectId":"676e7130fdbe8322e23bf354","name":"Gamze","lastName":"Guclu","documentHash":"f18ed5af-3a51-45f3-a144-bf1042eafb58"},{"objectId":"676e7130fdbe8322e23bf353","name":"Kouame Fulbert","lastName":"Oussou","documentHash":"70e22df3-8a29-4ca7-971b-88c96890ce33"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9106","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Starowicz","uuid":"4B013299B3042105F83161B8FEC8C2AFE99A43C0731E4233A861F9527288289333FD7AF50660B70486E0E2F9EAA01C3F56B7B36075573598CE5AD9EED841EF89","documentHash":"1dffe897-4b02-48b2-836f-24fe503b9548"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e7130fdbe8322e23bf352","doi":"10.3390/separations10010010","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85146745813&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"GC-MS-olfactometric characterization of volatile and key odorants in moringa (Moringa oleifera) and kinkeliba (Combretum micranthum G.

Key odorants are one of the main parameters to elucidate the final herbal tea’s overall quality and consumer acceptance. In the present study, for the first time, the brewing effect on volatile, key odorants, total phenolic contents, and antioxidant potential of Moringa (Moringa oleifera) and Kinkeliba (Combretum micranthum G. Don) herbal teas was comprehensively investigated. Two different infusions were studied and labeled as 25 °C/24 h (room temperature) and 98 °C/10 min (hot temperature). A total of 45 and 44 aroma compounds were detected in Moringa cold and hot teas, respectively, whereas 39 volatiles were determined in both infusion techniques for Kinkeliba herbal teas. The total amount of volatile compounds in both cold-infused herbal teas was higher than those in the hot-infused ones. Based on GC-MS-Olfactometry results, 19 and 21 key odorants in total were found in Moringa and Kinkeliba teas, respectively. The principal key odorants in Moringa teas with the highest flavor dilution (FD) factors were (E)-2-hexen-1-ol (herbal/fresh aroma), 3-hexanol (green/grassy), 2-phenyl ethanol (floral/rose), while in Kinkeliba teas they were 2-hexanol (herbal/green) and 3-penten-2-ol (green/fresh). The total phenolic content and antioxidant potential in Moringa and Kinkeliba teas increased using hot infusion. Principal component analysis showed that each tea infusion was clearly discriminated in terms of its volatile profiles.

The thiore-doxin system is one of the skin antioxidant systems, which protects cells against oxidative stress, regulates cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis, and also participates in signal transmission by regulating the activity of transcription factors. Recent studies have shown a correla-tion between the epidermal transcription factor Foxn1 and the thioredoxin system in mouse skin. Mass spectrometry analysis, followed by in vitro and in vivo experiments, showed that Foxn1 in keratinocytes regulates elements of the electron transport chain as well as the thioredoxin system (Txn2, Txnrd3), especially under hypoxic condition. High levels of Txnrd3 mRNA were detected for the first time in the injured skin of Foxn1+/+ mice compared to Foxn1-/- mice, and also showed that Foxn1 in keratinocytes upregulates Txnrd3 protein expression. Moreover, in silico analyzes indicated possible binding sites of the transcription factor Foxn1 in the Txn system. In conclusion, the data presented in this review identify Foxn1 as a novel component of the skin antioxidant system. © 2023, Polish Biochemical Society.

Microbiomes are also intimately associated with complex multicellular organisms such as humans, other animals, plants, and insects and perform crucial roles for the health of their hosts. Although we are starting to understand that microbiomes in different systems are interconnected, there is still a poor understanding of microbiome transfer and connectivity. In this review we show how microbiomes are connected within and transferred between different habitats and discuss the functional consequences of these connections. Microbiome transfer occurs between and within abiotic (e.g., air, soil, and water) and biotic environments, and can either be mediated through different vectors (e.g., insects or food) or direct interactions. Such transfer processes may also include the transmission of pathogens or antibiotic resistance genes. However, here, we highlight the fact that microbiome transmission can have positive effects on planetary and human health, where transmitted microorganisms potentially providing novel functions may be important for the adaptation of ecosystems.

The nutritional value of eggplant comes from the fact that it is considered a significant source of bioactive substances, such as phenolics and anthocyanins. These kinds of phytochemicals can be employed in food products as natural antioxidants or colors. Nasunin or delphinidin-3-(coumaroylrutinoside)-5-glucoside is a main flavonoid present in eggplant fruit, particularly the peels, which has recently drawn much consideration because of its positive effects on human well-being and potential applications in the food industry. The eggplant’s peels, which are the fruit’s outer layer, are widely available as agricultural byproducts for the extraction of nasunin. Such waste products constitute a significant loss of precious resources and have negative effects on the environment and the economy. Consequently, this review paper tries to highlight the main properties of the nasunin such as its antioxidant activity, gastrointestinal uptake, and the extraction approaches used for its isolation. Then, the major benefits of nasunin in human nutrition are described comprehensively.

Estradiol-17β (E2) is the primary pregnancy recognition signal in pigs, and its effects are augmented by luteotropic prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). On the contrary, prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) exerts mainly a luteolytic effect. The present study aimed to elucidate whether E2, PGE2, and PGF2α regulate the expression of PROK1 and its receptors in the porcine CL and to determine the PROK1 effect on luteal endothelial cells and pathways that may be involved in this regulation. The effects of E2, PGE2, and PGF2α on the expressions of PROK1 and its receptors in the CL were studied using an in vitro model of ultrathin luteal tissue explants model. Additionally, the effects of E2 and PGE2 on the PROK1 system were determined using an in vivo approach, in which the hormones were administered into the uterine lumen to imitate their secretion by embryos. Endothelial cell proliferation was measured using the colorimetric method. E2 acting via estrogen receptors simulated the mRNA and protein expressions of PROK1 and PROKR1 in CL explants in vitro (p < 0.05). The simultaneous action of E2 with PGE2 enhanced the expression of luteal PROK1 mRNA in vitro (p < 0.05). Estradiol-17β acting alone significantly increased PROK1 mRNA levels in vivo, whereas E2 simultaneously administered with PGE2 significantly elevated the PROK1 mRNA expression and PROKR1 mRNA and protein contents in CLs adjacent to uterine horns receiving hormonal infusion compared with CLs adjacent to placebo-treated uterine horns (p < 0.01). The PROK1 protein expression was significantly higher in the CLs of pigs treated with E2, PGE2, and E2 together with PGE2 than in the control group. PGF2α increased the PROK1 mRNA content in CLs on days 12 and 14 of the estrous cycle (p < 0.05). The expression of PROKR2 at the mRNA and protein levels remained unchanged in response to in vitro and in vivo treatments. PROK1 stimulated the proliferation of luteal endothelial cells by activating the MAPK, AKT, and mTOR pathways (p < 0.05). In summary, the luteal expressions of PROK1 and PROKR1 in early pregnancy are regulated by E2 and PGE2. PROK1 stimulates luteal angiogenesis by activating the MAPK, AKT, and mTOR pathways. The regulation of luteal PROK1 expression by PGF2α indicates PROK1's putative role during luteolysis. We conclude that PROK1-PROKR1 signaling supports luteal function during CL rescue in pregnancy in pigs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d6878c28a04739dbc4","5e70940d878c28a0473b588e","5e70947f878c28a0473be650","65c44ab840e3ff0466a35393"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"226","pagesFromTo":"39-48","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65c44ab840e3ff0466a35393","5e70947f878c28a0473be650","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbc4","5e70940d878c28a0473b588e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479934","mniswId":"19490","title":"Theriogenology","issn":"0093-691X","eissn":"1879-3231","documentHash":"5a895e76-bf91-415f-9ad3-e560a5ae5bdf"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Prokineticin 1","Estradiol","Prostaglandins","Angiogenesis","Corpus luteum","Pregnancy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060268243"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5891","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Blitek","uuid":"4263ED68AEBDFB512F30858455187BB115ADECCF4A1CC327E3D1CFDFA12A86C092D7999418469C4C1449C975B17696E1C34600F2CB46B681901338A10D56E140","documentHash":"ee8181af-e24a-458d-863a-637f020ef098"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db92","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":"B098C0A528257742FE7260630F778D12964C7B5C6227723C0B82DB42874A1368CF6017A4E9CA6B7F39C9E84245C06E67EF1E4D8E3489D40F22A3D57CCE9F1BE1","documentHash":"71a82dd5-3af9-42bb-bfe3-be6e20ae2dfa"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e917afdbe8322e23ce75b","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-41197-z","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85168986705&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Diverse effects of prostacyclin on angiogenesis-related processes in the porcine endometrium","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Angiogenesis is important for endometrial remodeling in mature females. The endometrium synthesizes high amounts of prostacyclin (PGI2) but the role of PGI2 in angiogenesis-related events in this tissue was not fully described. In the present study, porcine endometrial endothelial (pEETH) cells and/or a swine umbilical vein endothelial cell line (G1410 cells) were used to determine the regulation of PGI2 synthesis and PGI2 receptor (PTGIR) expression by cytokines and to evaluate the effect of PGI2 on pro-angiogenic gene expression, intracellular signaling activation, cell proliferation and migration, cell cycle distribution, and capillary-like structure formation. We found that IL1β, IFNγ, and/or TNFα increased PGI2 secretion and PTGIR expression in pEETH cells. Iloprost (a PGI2 analogue) acting through PTGIR enhanced the transcript abundance of KDR, FGFR2, and ANGPT2 and increased proliferation of pEETH cells. This latter was mediated by PI3K and mTOR activation. In support, transfection of G1410 cells with siRNA targeting PGI2 synthase decreased pro-angiogenic gene expression and cell proliferation. Furthermore, iloprost accelerated the gap closure and promoted cell cycle progression. Intriguingly, the formation of capillary-like structures was inhibited but not completely blocked by iloprost.

Twenty prepubertal gilts received 750 IU PMSG and 500 IU hCG 72 h later, while 18 prepubertal gilts in the control group were observed daily for estrus behavior. Gilts were inseminated in their first estrus and slaughtered on days 10, 12, and 15 of pregnancy to collect endometrial and myometrial tissues for mRNA analysis using real-time PCR. As we previously described, gilts with PMSG/hCG-induced estrus showed decreased luteal P4 synthesis on days 10 and 12 of pregnancy. PMSG/hCG treatment did not affect P4 receptor mRNA expression in either uterine tissue. In the endometrium, a greater mRNA transcript abundance of estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2), androgen receptor (AR), prostaglandin (PG) E2 receptors (PTGER2 and PTGER4), PGF2α receptor (PTGFR), interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R), and tumor necrosis factor α receptors (TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B) was detected in gilts with natural than with PMSG/hCG-induced estrus (P<0.05). In the myometrium, the mRNA expression of AR, PTGER2, and PTGFR was lower, while PGI2 receptor (PTGIR) transcript abundance was elevated in the gilts treated with PMSG/hCG as compared with the control animals (P<0.05). In summary, a decreased luteal P4 level during the peri-implantation period in gonadotropin-stimulated pigs affects endometrial and myometrial receptor expression, with the endometrium being more sensitive to impaired P4 synthesis.

The change of serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6, interleukin 8 and tumor necrosis factor measured directly before intervention in comparison to samples taken one and thirty days after vitamin D3 supplementation were used as biomarkers for distinguishing low, mid and high responders. Interestingly, we identified 39 % of the study participants as low responders. In contrast, when we used in a subset of 37 study participants whole blood expression changes of seven well-known vitamin D target genes one and thirty days after supplementation as alternative biomarkers, only 9 persons (24 %) were identified as low responders. In conclusion, in Saudi Arabia the rate of low vitamin D responders is equal or even higher than that in Finland. Therefore, similar to Nordic countries also in Saudi Arabia appropriate vitamin D3 supplementation is essential, in order to fulfill the needs of low responders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63589ba9752340623bc06a28","63589ba9752340623bc06a15","6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","pagesFromTo":"art. no 102137 (1-7)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676ea484fdbe8322e23d9a85","63589ba9752340623bc06a15","63589ba9752340623bc06a28","676ea484fdbe8322e23d9a86","676ea484fdbe8322e23d9a87","676ea484fdbe8322e23d9a88","676ea484fdbe8322e23d9a89","6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479667","mniswId":"18146","title":"Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal","issn":"1319-0164","eissn":"2213-7475","documentHash":"af2dbf10-add6-4b2e-8fa1-079c3db65339"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Vitamin D3 supplementation","Proinflammatory cytokines","Vitamin D target genes","Vitamin D response index","Saudi cohort"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060268268"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e76a4fdbe8322e23c126a","name":"Alireza","lastName":"Fazeli","documentHash":"f3d86b6f-900b-41e2-9533-b7e86743b36f"},{"objectId":"676e76a4fdbe8322e23c1269","name":"Suranga","lastName":"Kodithuwakku","documentHash":"a88b4a82-39fd-4282-97ef-dd5625610469"},{"objectId":"676e76a4fdbe8322e23c1268","name":"Ants","lastName":"Kavak","documentHash":"ea7efe65-ed79-426a-97fd-e6c89a54227a"},{"objectId":"676e76a4fdbe8322e23c1267","name":"Madhusha","lastName":"Prasadani","documentHash":"40206798-1479-437c-92be-2180e0ec041d"},{"objectId":"676e76a4fdbe8322e23c1266","name":"Marilin","lastName":"Ivask","documentHash":"c5db14b6-a0da-427f-92d6-aaf5dfbc990e"},{"objectId":"676e76a4fdbe8322e23c1265","name":"Keerthie","lastName":"Dissanayake","documentHash":"99558a47-8356-4122-aa43-772af9b1c8eb"},{"objectId":"676e76a4fdbe8322e23c1264","name":"Andres","lastName":"Waldmann","documentHash":"4bc55fb5-2543-4333-9553-bee2794bb9c0"},{"objectId":"676e76a4fdbe8322e23c1263","name":"Johanna","lastName":"Piibor","documentHash":"2d7de636-6f4d-47c1-99ad-ae65f5ccec1b"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5af0","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Andronowska","uuid":"FED2FCAE6B5DD0135A4EFBF728ABE3CD84F3632BC016B99F64D43ACE18BE814653A6357A19ED098836C69D0922559315762EE4FC0E18D9A07A5470B86F46C8AA","documentHash":"3f8bf776-486a-4bde-953d-9dc774171f3e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e76a4fdbe8322e23c1262","doi":"10.1016/j.mcpro.2023.100642","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85178224205&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Uterine fluid extracellular vesicles proteome Is altered during the estrous cycle","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Uterine environment is tightly and finely regulated via various signaling pathways mediated through endocrine, exocrine, autocrine, juxtacrine, and paracrine mechanisms. In utero signaling processes are paramount for normal and abnormal physiology which involves cell to cell, cells to gametes, cells to embryo, and even inter-kingdom communications due to presence of uterine microbiota. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the uterine fluid (UF) and their cargo components are known to be mediators of in utero signaling and communications. Interestingly, the changes in UF-EV proteome during the bovine estrous cycle and the effects of these differentially enriched proteins on embryo development are yet to be fully discovered. In this study, shotgun quantitative proteomics–based mass spectrometry was employed to compare UF-EV proteomes at day 0, 7, and 16 of the estrous cycle to understand the estrous cycle–dependent dynamics. Furthermore, different phase UF-EVs were supplemented in embryo cultures to evaluate their impact on embryo development. One hundred fifty-nine UF-EV proteins were differentially enriched at different time points indicating the UF-EV proteome is cycle-dependent. Overall, many identified pathways are important for normal uterine functions, early embryo development, and its nutritional needs, such as antioxidant activity, cell morphology and cycle, cellular homeostasis, cell adhesion, and carbohydrate metabolic process. Furthermore, the luteal phase UF-EVs supplementation increased in vitro blastocyst rates from 25.0 ± 5.9% to 41.0 ± 4.0% (p ≤ 0.05). Our findings highlight the importance of bovine UF-EV in uterine communications throughout the estrous cycle. Interestingly, comparison of hormone-synchronized EV proteomes to natural cycle UF-EVs indicated shift of signaling. Finally, UF-EVs can be used to improve embryo production in vitro. © 2023 THE AUTHORS.

However, little is known about the bioactivity of seeds from other Vitis species. The aim of this study has been to compare the phenolic composition, antimicrobial activity, and antioxidant activity of extracts from seeds of four Vitis species (V. riparia Michx., V. californica Benth., V. amurensis Rupr., and V. vinifera L.). Antioxidant activities were assessed as ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH•) scavenging activity, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). The antimicrobial activity was determined using the microdilution method against some Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium, and Enterobacter aerogenes) and Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to evaluate the phenolic profile of extracts. Flavan-3-ols, procyanidins, phenolic acids, flavonols, anthocyanins, and stilbenoids were detected. (+)-Catechin and (−)-epicatechin turned out to be the most abundant in the phenolic profile of V. amurensis seed extract. Phenolic acids prevailed in the extract from V. vinifera seeds. The V. riparia and V. californica seed extracts had higher contents of most individual phenolics compared to the other Vitis species. They also showed a higher total phenolic content, DPPH• scavenging activity, ORAC, and overall antibacterial activity. Total phenolic content significantly correlated with antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity against E. coli. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed discrimination between V. vinifera, V. amurensis, and clustered V. riparia and V. californica with respect to variables. To recapitulate, this research demonstrates that seeds of different Vitis species, especially V. riparia and V. californica, are sources of molecules with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities that can be used in different sectors, such as in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b59e7","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"art. no 4924 (1-16)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676e77acfdbe8322e23c184d","676e77acfdbe8322e23c184e","676e77acfdbe8322e23c184f","676e77acfdbe8322e23c1850","676e77acfdbe8322e23c1851","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","5e709410878c28a0473b59e7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","documentHash":"8615ffac-9999-41cd-9658-bd5ed633cde5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["grape seeds","by-products","phytochemical profile","Gram-negative bacteria","Gram-positive bacteria","antiradical activity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060268368"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67726caffdbe831015c6042f","name":"Graça","lastName":"Ferreira-Dias","documentHash":"83863b20-83f3-4913-98c5-5ec752072e35"},{"objectId":"67726caffdbe831015c6042e","name":"Maria R.","lastName":"Rebordão","documentHash":"b805f134-cc19-475d-83c2-d416e608b327"},{"objectId":"67726caffdbe831015c6042d","name":"Jorge","lastName":"Pimenta","documentHash":"a21332d2-b640-41dd-90d6-a47a35d4c7ee"},{"objectId":"67726caffdbe831015c6042b","name":"Joana","lastName":"Alpoim-Moreira","documentHash":"c89d8256-0824-4e5d-9074-f0135c84bab8"},{"objectId":"67726caffdbe831015c6042a","name":"Beatriz","lastName":"Celeiro e Silva","documentHash":"b25883c1-f336-4fe8-94cb-ecd26d43c4ee"},{"objectId":"5e70945e878c28a0473bb8c4","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Sadowska","uuid":"B2FA7D15AE7D202F747C52FDCC8E6391B4F9DFBE7DC508A62206BD6655A51332D9718F2C7958061052C1B48B6D8887B3EDEC43B179FD3D768A5D3B2D49FE335F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3188-792X","documentHash":"0c16a31a-360d-4353-8126-a407d43c5983"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Skarżyński","uuid":"893E2C4B87695FF9AC23B84616C654F5B1E6FC9D903BB90BDCE1C38DABAFE563D8799DF0E9B5E427AD9DE60E48421A2744D5C1C29108A61057E0DC537A800774","orcidId":"0000-0001-9537-3560","documentHash":"f2e476d8-aceb-487d-b95e-e46c79fa4e0b"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588f","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kowalik","uuid":"7A7C3A9F21F6AB89CF7A93BE9AFD84358C361AF1ED8C2FD983B77498398EB447F35B9C99B1AA1CBA0B31DD725219020B8BC567823865E988B3DAE715A8E589D5","orcidId":"0000-0001-7637-0911","documentHash":"bc59a033-f672-4d53-adfe-4d685d38e0cd"},{"objectId":"5e709405878c28a0473b503d","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Piotrowska-Tomala","uuid":"08655195301AB16CFBBAF6836407CA5B5F96284617C027E3567B21749FC0C648F26E0DA496EAE968D693FEDE9EED13373A77BDF47C0B58A830AA64F15742ED21","documentHash":"d96955e8-dcad-453c-a597-7dc8f2095fed"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szóstek-Mioduchowska","uuid":"967AF197FAE274F7A3920BD12A655DA90CD1F8A691C090E35027D38FA489D9F3DD09D69E31DFB0A2C53148A67D83239257109137F7D6023AC24209FF207A256C","documentHash":"585d4348-5759-42bf-9e5e-134716588ad9"},{"objectId":"5e7092e3878c28a04739ecf4","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Drzewiecka","uuid":"E67BE5A4BB66D8B0FD1F67B7CD96D5943084F50EC3E7DA12F5EDA48C0E85F52193BC9BE52F73A4B7577C1FE23605C3BBEA2703EF74DE2A9B150361B46A481AAE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1328-0190","documentHash":"e0d6769a-6d72-4d60-a81c-53bfc3e91cc1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67726caffdbe831015c60429","doi":"10.1016/j.repbio.2024.100962","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The alteration in myometrial mRNA transcription of the regulatory genes of DNA methylation in mare with endometrosis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A reduction in myometrial contractile activity can lead to inadequate cleaning of the uterine lumen, resulting in persistent endometritis and potentially endometrosis in mares. Oxytocin (OXT) is a key hormonal regulator of myometrial contraction. While epigenetic regulation of myometrial gene expression has been studied in humans, there is limited information on the expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TETs) in the myometrium of mares. This study aimed to evaluate the mRNA transcription of these enzymes and the potential role of DNA methylation in the expression of the OXT receptor (OXTR) gene in the myometrium of mares with endometrosis. Myometrial samples were collected post-mortem during the mid-luteal (n = 23) and follicular (n = 20) phases of the estrous cycle and assessed according to Kenney and Doig endometrial category (I, IIA, IIB, III). mRNA transcription of OXTR, DNMT1, -3A, -3B and TET1, -2, -3 were determined using qPCR. DNA methylation analysis at CpG islands of OXTR exons 1 and 2 was performed using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Myometrial OXTR mRNA transcription and DNA methylation in its promoter region showed no significant differences between categories, although increased methylation was observed at CpG island position 6 in exon 2. DNMT1, TET2, and TET3 mRNA transcription was altered in the equine myometrium depending on the phase of the estrous cycle and the severity of endometrosis (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that DNMTs and TETs were expressed in myometrium in a manner specific to the severity of endometrosis and phases of the estrous cycle, suggesting a potential regulatory role in DNA methylation of myometrial gene expression."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf","5e70940d878c28a0473b588f","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","5e70945e878c28a0473bb8c4","5e7092e3878c28a04739ecf4","5e709405878c28a0473b503d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"art. no  100962 (1-7)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67726caffdbe831015c6042a","5e7092e3878c28a04739ecf4","5e709405878c28a0473b503d","67726caffdbe831015c6042b","5e70945e878c28a0473bb8c4","5e70940d878c28a0473b588f","67726caffdbe831015c6042d","67726caffdbe831015c6042e","67726caffdbe831015c6042f","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e722042467f01e93054c9c","title":"Reproductive Biology","issn":"1477-7827","documentHash":"fe097ffb-75b8-4aa8-82e6-0d6de3529780"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Endometrium","Endometrosis","DNMT","TET","OXTR"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060268400"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e8741fdbe8322e23c6db7","name":"Abdel H.","lastName":"Harrath","documentHash":"c414e259-b899-4503-866f-f2f66f09317b"},{"objectId":"676e8741fdbe8322e23c6db6","name":"Saleh","lastName":"Alwasel","documentHash":"1cbe9790-93b2-4861-aa42-80072d2d3945"},{"objectId":"676e8741fdbe8322e23c6db5","name":"Igor","lastName":"Valocky","documentHash":"4dac3094-850d-4e78-8f8b-ba79674b17e7"},{"objectId":"676e8741fdbe8322e23c6db4","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Fabova","documentHash":"19407aae-4702-4079-841b-b77c93eda3d8"},{"objectId":"676e8741fdbe8322e23c6db3","name":"Adam","lastName":"Tarko","documentHash":"67bbde2f-2f8e-4886-b4ac-f1c86116d92a"},{"objectId":"676e8741fdbe8322e23c6db2","name":"Alexander V.","lastName":"Sirotkin","documentHash":"cbca090d-404d-4caf-a6c5-10b2bf03bc44"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c28","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kotwica","uuid":"385A852C4444CB9E0834360EA9CB5447DAA8769BC4824DF6157291803425A6E6379F07FED1C99EFB7D5F465E5A6BE9848257FE25794C37B2D7DB4C3937D900CE","documentHash":"3d7a4dfa-c22d-4959-9a2f-2a1c9f18e44c"}],"objectId":"676e8741fdbe8322e23c6db1","doi":"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2023.06.018","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85162003529&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Can flaxseed, chia or puncture vine affect mare ovarian cell functions and prevent the toxic effect of the environmental contaminant toluene?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this in vitro study was to examine the potential effect of functional food plant extracts, namely, extracts of flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.), chia (Salvia hispanica) and puncture vine (Tribulus terrestris L.), on basic mare ovarian cell functions and their response to the environmental contaminant toluene. Mare granulosa cells were incubated with and without toluene (0, 0.02, 0.2 or 2.0 μg/mL) in the presence or absence of flaxseed, chia and puncture vine extracts (10 μg/mL). Markers of cell proliferation (accumulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA) and apoptosis (accumulation of bax), viability (Trypan blue extrusion) and the release of progesterone (P), oxytocin (OT) and prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PGF) were measured. Toluene reduced all other measured parameters except OT release. All the tested plants were able to reduce cell viability and the release of P and PGF, but they did not influence other indexes. Moreover, flaxseed mitigated toluene action on ovarian cell proliferation, apoptosis, OT and PGF, whilst puncture vine prevented and inverted toluene action on P and PGF ourput. Chia extract did not modify toluene action on any parameter. On the other hand, toluene was able to promote the inhibitory action of flaxseed on cell viability and P release and to prevent the inhibitory action of all the plant extracts on PGF release. The present study (1) is the first demonstration, that flaxseed, chia and puncture vine can directly suppress mare ovarian cell functions, (2) shows that toluene can suppress basic ovarian cell functions and modify the reproductive effect of food plants and (3) demonstrates the ability of flaxseed and puncture vine, but not of chia, to prevent some toxic effect of toluene on mare ovarian

They constitute an incurable diverse group of disorders characterized by the progressive degeneration of the structure and function of the central or peripheral nervous system. There is an enormous unmet demand worldwide for methods for the early detection of ND biomarkers. The complexity of the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal degeneration as well as the inhomogeneity of the patient population pose a great challenge for the development of early diagnostic tools. Various analytical technologies have been developed to meet this challenge. Among the various approaches reported so far, biosensors are powerful analytical implements that have been applied to detect biomarkers of NDs. Over the past decade, electrochemical aptasensors have been at the forefront of this development not only thanks to their low cost and simple design but also due to advances in nanomaterials modifying the surface of the transducers involved. The design of electrochemical aptasensors for the detection of ND biomarkers such as α-synuclein, amyloid β peptide, tau protein and human cellular prion protein were summarized and compared. Innovative strategies for increasing their sensitivity and selectivity were also pointed out. Undoubtedly, there is still a need for low-cost, fast and easy-to-use systems for the early detection of NDs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947f878c28a0473be65a","5e70947f878c28a0473be65b","676e647bfdbe8322e23bc18b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art. no 235 (1-21)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947f878c28a0473be65a","676e647bfdbe8322e23bc18b","5e70947f878c28a0473be65b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bd6e","mniswId":"3957","title":"Coatings","issn":"2079-6412","websiteLink":"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/coatings/about","documentHash":"e73cd550-7d7f-4ea0-afa5-5bb4d5feaf21"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aptasensor","aptamer","neurodegenerative disease biomarkers","electrochemical detection"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060268514"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b910c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ogrodowczyk","uuid":"D07F9EC28955A5934880501322D4ED21F7DAE4AAABEBBB6BE0F0B2AFE83F269D32B39654C2AE55DD88563058C23F771C86299989B6D6A395E89B84F903066998","documentHash":"4a448f66-2073-4e5a-b80e-d7f42561eb9a"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5b31","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Wasilewska","uuid":"BA98D5318EFEEE51897739A2B326B823C86644EEC0818026715F8DDC62B889E3F1A996E9AFDA76BF64104CDF6AAE4F5B04380482BC3936E5B1BE707E7ECD39FD","documentHash":"22bff37a-a334-4bf9-a249-e4060408ea4c"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5aef","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Wróblewska","uuid":"5DB03D00276FB168A632F58946904D68371579A788199D21A9EF92ED0D66A6CE10D4942D9186141FE9863E443F60CBF7B7368A38845839154002943427732A15","documentHash":"56465ee4-d650-4e09-bfd2-a0d6e9de84a5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e9f60fdbe8322e23d7bf3","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-44775-3","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85174467675&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Immunoreactive proteins of Capsicum-based spices as a threat to human health: mass spectrometry analysis and in silico mapping","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Dietary patterns are changing severely, especially the consumption of highly processed foods with lots of spices is increasing, carrying an increased risk of immediate hypersensitivity (type I), in sensitised individuals, due to the possible presence of allergens, especially the hidden ones.

In conclusion, the ex vivo model proved that the glycation process does not reduce protein immunogenicity. © 2023 by the authors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b590b","602df3679543c7410626e8d0","5e7092b1878c28a04739ad94","5e709411878c28a0473b5aef","5e7092d6878c28a04739db7b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"art. no 3110 (1-15)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940f878c28a0473b590b","602df3679543c7410626e8d0","5e7092b1878c28a04739ad94","5e7092d6878c28a04739db7b","5e709411878c28a0473b5aef"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","issn":"2072-6643","documentHash":"c19e39d9-34f9-43a7-9c35-a6b3e3ec2726"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bovine β-lactoglobulin","glycation","mice C57BL/6","T cells","α-lactalbumin"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060268524"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6772809ffdbe831015c84bca","name":"Julien","lastName":"Bobe","documentHash":"58106083-97bd-467a-9d9d-53fc06fe3faa"},{"objectId":"6772809ffdbe831015c84bc9","name":"Pineau","lastName":"Charles","documentHash":"331b7f4f-65ae-4f87-9b18-270ca63c7f8b"},{"objectId":"6772809ffdbe831015c84bc8","name":"Jérôme","lastName":"Montfort","documentHash":"632d58c2-8520-4c96-aeda-baf1f0b0ba3a"},{"objectId":"6772809ffdbe831015c84bc7","name":"Thaovi","lastName":"Nguyen","documentHash":"c84e5062-f5e6-4d39-8e0f-293410d07608"},{"objectId":"6772809ffdbe831015c84bc6","name":"Régis","lastName":"Lavigne","documentHash":"82217130-830c-4e6e-8ae8-b04aa24b4c12"},{"objectId":"6772809ffdbe831015c84bc5","name":"Emmanuelle","lastName":"Com","documentHash":"2ee285ee-10e5-4333-a4dc-3a4f1c8b4033"},{"objectId":"6772809ffdbe831015c84bc4","name":"Blandine","lastName":"Guével","documentHash":"31d31008-434f-4160-b090-6d3573816765"},{"objectId":"6772809ffdbe831015c84bc3","name":"Hélène","lastName":"Rime","documentHash":"a22c1a96-6d96-47e8-9fac-1b59cfd34cac"},{"objectId":"6772809ffdbe831015c84bc2","name":"Aurélie","lastName":"Gueho","documentHash":"ce491fa7-0eda-4727-8378-e0c620a3d922"},{"objectId":"5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Żarski","uuid":"C79A8111D2D012910483FF5D04C579E9FE114BBBFDBA5CB7C07AD1BEF561D1BD73734995AC49C0CF23B9AA29ACAE919DB99FD8CDFA546404CB973C5E79C1ADB2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3082-9250","documentHash":"720051ea-3868-48ad-9aab-29755a850bd5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6772809ffdbe831015c84bc1","doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-60118-2","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85191621476&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Evolutionarily conserved ovarian fluid proteins are responsible for extending egg viability in salmonid fish","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In contrast to most fishes, salmonids exhibit the unique ability to hold their eggs for several days after ovulation without significant loss of viability. During this period, eggs are held in the body cavity in a biological fluid, the coelomic fluid (CF) that is responsible for preserving egg viability. To identify CF proteins responsible for preserving egg viability, a proteomic comparison was performed using 3 salmonid species and 3 non-salmonid species to identify salmonid-specific highly abundant proteins. In parallel, rainbow trout CF fractions were purified and used in a biological test to estimate their egg viability preservation potential. The most biologically active CF fractions were then subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. We identified 50 proteins overabundant in salmonids and present in analytical fractions with high egg viability preservation potential. The identity of these proteins illuminates the biological processes participating in egg viability preservation. Among identified proteins of interest, the ovarian-specific expression and abundance in CF at ovulation of N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase a (Nansa) suggest a previously unsuspected role. We show that salmonid CF is a complex biological fluid containing a diversity of proteins related to immunity, calcium binding, lipid metabolism, proteolysis, extracellular matrix and sialic acid metabolic pathway that are collectively responsible for preserving egg viability. © The Author(s) 2024."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"art. no 9651 (1-16)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6772809ffdbe831015c84bc2","5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90","6772809ffdbe831015c84bc3","6772809ffdbe831015c84bc4","6772809ffdbe831015c84bc5","6772809ffdbe831015c84bc6","6772809ffdbe831015c84bc7","6772809ffdbe831015c84bc8","6772809ffdbe831015c84bc9","6772809ffdbe831015c84bca"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e72c172467f01e931097bc","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"1053-8100","documentHash":"46b51ef7-40cf-4a0a-bec7-7c4781b52d4e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060268547"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676963eafdbe8317b9a2be54","name":"Jaime E.","lastName":"Jiménez","documentHash":"750a3f51-57b2-4f88-aa95-30a4e5ec7cf1"},{"objectId":"676963eafdbe8317b9a2be53","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Hoby","documentHash":"45100810-d323-4dce-8a8a-9f29a3304c84"},{"objectId":"676963eafdbe8317b9a2be52","name":"Adrian J.","lastName":"Monjeau","documentHash":"597f84e2-cc05-4ef7-afa9-ad0696120e82"},{"objectId":"676963eafdbe8317b9a2be51","name":"Silvina M.","lastName":"Molinuevo","documentHash":"4d26194d-7626-4d5d-a120-6a164ce0b3df"},{"objectId":"676963eafdbe8317b9a2be50","name":"Javier","lastName":"Barrio","documentHash":"a9ca452c-9a09-40f7-8778-73081d17d87e"},{"objectId":"676963eafdbe8317b9a2be4f","name":"Fernando","lastName":"Vidal","documentHash":"1905aa51-70c4-4226-a8a7-cc93389a8c24"},{"objectId":"676963eafdbe8317b9a2be4e","name":"Patricia","lastName":"Black-Decima","documentHash":"8e94f99e-22f5-4343-97b0-09a7301e1e18"},{"objectId":"676963eafdbe8317b9a2be4d","name":"James R.","lastName":"Heffelfinger","documentHash":"7f3fa8c6-8a14-4752-aa4a-c4b6add58b5f"},{"objectId":"676963eafdbe8317b9a2be4c","name":"Beat","lastName":"Fuchs","documentHash":"bfa4d4ad-68df-4447-8819-8ad1d3ead985"},{"objectId":"676963eafdbe8317b9a2be4b","name":"Melina E.","lastName":"Zuliani","documentHash":"025c4a1b-e010-448a-8ea7-a7564532cc73"},{"objectId":"676963eafdbe8317b9a2be4a","name":"Miguel E.","lastName":"Escobar","documentHash":"c9ff938c-b031-417e-b01e-539ba628a567"},{"objectId":"676963eafdbe8317b9a2be49","name":"Jo Anne M.","lastName":"Smith-Flueck","documentHash":"49f2fcac-968a-4857-87e6-0a615044ff63"},{"objectId":"676963eafdbe8317b9a2be48","name":"Werner T.","lastName":"Flueck","documentHash":"09fa560c-5464-40e2-a9e8-5f06eb62fe56"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af553","name":"Zygmunt","lastName":"Giżejewski","uuid":"8CBC5CEA3F803C045CBD6082F4D468D4933CD0EA19098BFBEC40D4AAD261FD7016C5FCC08BA773AC31A328B0E61D2A021137999BC16A451F91438D3E59EF2A2F","documentHash":"c81ee854-a18a-4ae8-90ba-919cbf98b27f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676963eafdbe8317b9a2be47","doi":"10.3390/conservation3040036","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Review of Historical and Zooarchaeological Data to Trace Past Biogeographic Distribution of Endangered Huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) to Enhance Conservation Strategies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Conservation strategies for huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus), listed as an endangered cervid by IUCN, have not helped to reverse its declining population trends. Recent evaluations of historical data revealed that they also inhabited lower valleys and grasslands as residents or only during winter. However, the dogma persists that huemuls do not need such habitats. To determine if more solid evidence exists to back up or refute our hypothesis that huemuls once inhabited lower valleys and grasslands, we researched the literature and discovered additional relevant historical sources on this species. These new findings substantiate that huemuls also occupied unforested areas, reaching the Atlantic coast, and resided on various islands including Tierra del Fuego, and that their co-occurrence with guanaco was frequent. Their extreme naivety towards humans resulted in their extirpation on winter ranges settled by humans, resulting in refugee huemuls year-round on remote mountain summer ranges. The ease by which indigenous people could kill them for subsistence and commercial export of hides to Europe, followed by the lowlands becoming modified by settlers and their exotic species facilitated the huemuls’ extirpation. The hypothesis of a dramatic modification of the original biogeographical distribution of huemuls is supported by anatomical and ecological features along with historical accounts. Sedentariness on only rugged summer ranges makes long-term survival of this species crucially challenging and requires sound conservation strategies that incorporate geographical areas of their former distribution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af553"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"3","pagesFromTo":"569-594","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676963eafdbe8317b9a2be48","676963eafdbe8317b9a2be49","676963eafdbe8317b9a2be4a","676963eafdbe8317b9a2be4b","676963eafdbe8317b9a2be4c","676963eafdbe8317b9a2be4d","676963eafdbe8317b9a2be4e","5e7093b2878c28a0473af553","676963eafdbe8317b9a2be4f","676963eafdbe8317b9a2be50","676963eafdbe8317b9a2be51","676963eafdbe8317b9a2be52","676963eafdbe8317b9a2be53","676963eafdbe8317b9a2be54"]},"journal":{"objectId":"66bb45b3fdbe835e5ef4a220","title":"Conservation","issn":"2673-7159","websiteLink":"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/conservation","documentHash":"4ab560c2-6d92-4fd5-ae3a-0f946c6ed9bb"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["behavior","conservation policy","evolutionary ecology","historical distribution","Hippocamelus bisulcus","huemul","human impact","migration","nutritional ecology","refugee species"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060268601"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c2fea89543c72336543909","name":"Daria","lastName":"Rudewicz-Kowalczyk","uuid":"17953E60A16838A62BFDA82176F83F7B2A9ED8DD978EA4124A2DC6FF3BD0F63FF75835533755C35414AA3151E9278A6699F2105CE22936FA57574D7380497A60","documentHash":"bac2ec09-928c-4029-a67e-39225b27cafb"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be657","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Grabowska","uuid":"99E4EDA26D1AB0BBB99E0D5DBB59BA9C1CF38DA4C10C1EF6457AE972D5D0A5AF3B311AC06E20A64BD2505FEB1D770EB0E6F8F76F5A3AFA91BB9291924A395746","documentHash":"2b049818-67a3-4659-8d7c-ee0ddbffe8ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e82e3fdbe8322e23c48a9","doi":"10.3390/ijms24066005","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85151109706&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Simultaneous electrochemical detection of LDL and MDA-LDL using antibody-ferrocene or anthraquinone conjugates coated magnetic beads","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The simultaneous detection of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACSVD) biomarkers was recently of great scientific interest.

The approach proposed was based on the formation of two types of specific immunoconjugates consisting of monoclonal antibodies: anti-LDL or anti-MDA-LDL, together with redox active molecules: ferrocene and anthraquinone, respectively, coated on magnetic beads (MBs). The decrease in redox agent current in the concentration range: 0.001–1.0 ng/mL for LDL and 0.01–10.0 ng/mL for MDA-LDL, registered by square wave voltammetry (SWV), was observed upon the creation of complex between LDL or MDA-LDL and appropriate immunoconjugates. The detection limits of 0.2 ng/mL for LDL and 0.1 ng/mL for MDA-LDL were estimated.

They possess a number of phenolic compounds including phenolic acids, flavonoids such as flavan-3-ols, flavonols and anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, as well as saponins and phytic acid. This review provides a summary of the types and levels of phenolic compounds found in the cotyledon of lentils as well as their seed coats. The values define broad ranges due to varied cultivars, horticultural practices, climatic conditions during lentil development, and the different phenolic extraction approaches employed. The prepared lentil extracts were found to possess marked antioxidant activity, as assessed by in vitro assays, with the results clearly indicating that the endogenous phenolic compounds dictated this activity. Processing of raw lentils in the forms of cooking, germination and fermentation was determined to affect the phenolics’ contents: phenolic content of some lentils decreased while those of others increased, most likely due to the release of bound phenolics from the plant wall matrix. Finally, a summary of some of the positive biological activities observed for lentil extracts from cell culture and animal studies is given."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"852-864","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","6769488dfdbe8317b9a162cb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454778c0","mniswId":"4790","title":"Current Pharmaceutical Design","issn":"1381-6128","documentHash":"8fdb6d00-acd1-4147-8f3f-617b418f2dfa"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lentil","phenolic acids","flavonoids","tannins","antioxidants","processing","biological activity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060268648"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e7633fdbe8322e23c0f51","name":"Alireza","lastName":"Fazeli","documentHash":"d4fc14ed-7891-43ff-9f9a-8e30468b3660"},{"objectId":"676e7633fdbe8322e23c0f50","name":"Andres","lastName":"Waldmann","documentHash":"78c85f7a-1b4a-4360-8f06-5f10d60535b2"},{"objectId":"676e7633fdbe8322e23c0f4f","name":"Ants","lastName":"Kavak","documentHash":"e7060a5c-1f18-442d-8a55-68d75085b687"},{"objectId":"676e7633fdbe8322e23c0f4e","name":"Getnet","lastName":"Midekessa","documentHash":"cfe73973-affc-4ed3-80a2-4132598c801e"},{"objectId":"676e7633fdbe8322e23c0f4d","name":"Keerthie","lastName":"Dissanayake","documentHash":"0386f8c9-04d6-47d2-9a63-2a894b5df7fe"},{"objectId":"676e7633fdbe8322e23c0f4c","name":"Johanna","lastName":"Piibor","documentHash":"e8128a3f-afc0-47a5-870b-bb3960152213"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5af0","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Andronowska","uuid":"FED2FCAE6B5DD0135A4EFBF728ABE3CD84F3632BC016B99F64D43ACE18BE814653A6357A19ED098836C69D0922559315762EE4FC0E18D9A07A5470B86F46C8AA","documentHash":"3f8bf776-486a-4bde-953d-9dc774171f3e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e7633fdbe8322e23c0f4b","doi":"10.1007/s11259-022-10052-3","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85144666078&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Characterization of bovine uterine fluid extracellular vesicles proteomic profiles at follicular and luteal phases of the oestrous cycle","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Extracellular vesicles (EV) have been identified in uterine fluid (UF), however the bovine UF-EV profile during different phases of the oestrous cycle has not yet been established. Therefore, we compared the UF-EV, and their protein profile at follicular and luteal phases of the oestrous cycle. UF samples were collected from healthy uteri of six live and six slaughtered cows at follicular or luteal phases. Isolation of EV was performed using tangential flow filtration followed by size exclusion chromatography. EV were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), fluorescence NTA, zeta potential, and transmission electron microscopy. Mass-spectrometry was used to evaluate EV protein profile from live cows. Particle concentrations (mean ± SD) were higher (P < 0.05) at follicular than at luteal phase in both live (1.01 × 108 ± 1.66 × 107 vs 7.56 × 107 ± 1.80 × 107, respectively) and slaughtered cows (1.17 × 108 ± 2.34 × 107 vs 9.12 × 107 ± 9.77 × 106, respectively). The proportion of fluorescently labelled EV varied significantly between follicular and luteal phases across live (28.9 ± 1.9% vs 19.3 ± 2.8%, respectively) and slaughtered cows (26.5 ± 6.3% vs 27.3 ± 2 .7%, respectively). In total, 41 EV proteins were differentially expressed between the phases. Some of the proteins were involved in reproductive processes, cell adhesion and proliferation, and cellular metabolic processes. The results indicated differences in bovine UF-EV concentration and protein profile at follicular and luteal phases, which would suggest that EV modulate uterine microenvironment across the oestrous cycle.

As a consequence, masculinized fish possess less-developed testes without functional spermatic ducts. Therefore, the semen of sex-reversed females is generally characterized by low or highly variable quality and reflects testicular rather than ejaculated semen. The aim of our study was to evaluate the alterations in sperm freezability of sex-reversed female rainbow trout during the progression of the spawning season. Sperm concentration, seminal plasma osmolality, semen pH, gonadosomatic index (GSI) and total sperm production were monitored in fresh semen. The sperm motility parameters, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and sperm viability were examined throughout the spawning season in fresh and frozen/thawed semen. The day of the spawning season did not affect sperm motility of fresh semen. During the equilibration of semen, 2–3-fold increase in the sperm motility compared to fresh semen on each day of the spawning season was recorded. A decrease in the sperm motility after cryopreservation compared to equilibrated semen on each day of the spawning season was recorded. The highest ATP concentrations in fresh semen were noted on the 21st day of the spawning season, whereas in cryopreserved semen, these values were the highest on the 16th and 21st days of the spawning season. The viability of fresh semen did not change during the spawning season; however, the highest sperm viability after cryopreservation was observed between the 11th and 21st days of the spawning season. These results should be taken into account during the planning of cryopreservation of semen of valuable SRF individuals, which will be further used for fertilization of eggs under hatchery conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a40","5e709410878c28a0473b5a9a","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11d3","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb02","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"562","pagesFromTo":"art. no 738777 (1-8)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb02","5e709410878c28a0473b5a40","5e709410878c28a0473b5a9a","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11d3","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547715a","mniswId":"1539","title":"Aquaculture","issn":"0044-8486","eissn":"1873-5622","documentHash":"aaff1260-3172-4786-b919-d851b47a7a44"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Neomales","Spawning season","Sperm motility parameters","ATP production","Cryopreservation","Sperm viability"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060268694"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e6d32fdbe8322e23bdd10","name":"Danial","lastName":"Gorouhi","documentHash":"9227429a-4e68-4c22-ada3-d7a3cc3ce2a5"},{"objectId":"676e6d32fdbe8322e23bdd0f","name":"Bahram","lastName":"Falahatkar","documentHash":"5eff3edd-e79d-4550-8af1-77ec4b8ba9b0"},{"objectId":"676e6d32fdbe8322e23bdd0e","name":"Erfan Akbari","lastName":"Nargesi","documentHash":"80c30e4a-d53d-492f-a3af-98825e23ad73"},{"objectId":"5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Żarski","uuid":"C79A8111D2D012910483FF5D04C579E9FE114BBBFDBA5CB7C07AD1BEF561D1BD73734995AC49C0CF23B9AA29ACAE919DB99FD8CDFA546404CB973C5E79C1ADB2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3082-9250","documentHash":"720051ea-3868-48ad-9aab-29755a850bd5"}],"objectId":"676e6d32fdbe8322e23bdd0d","doi":"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2023.01.014","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85147221046&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The effectiveness of Ovaprim, Ovopel, and their combinations in artificial reproduction of common rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus under controlled conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, a practical protocol for artificial reproduction was developed for the rudd, Scardinius erythrophthalmus, to help to produce this fish for aquaculture industries and also for restocking programs. For this purpose, the efficiency of different hormonal agents and their combinations for spawning induction of female breeders of rudd was evaluated. Ovulations were stimulated using different treatments as: two injections of Ovaprim (Ova), two injections of Ovopel (Ovo), a priming dose of Ovopel with a resolving dose of Ovaprim (Comb1), a priming dose of Ovaprim with a resolving dose of Ovopel (Comb2), and two injections of sterile 0.9% NaCl solution as a control group. During the study, ovulation success, egg developmental competence as well as the performance of the freshly hatched larvae, were recorded. There was no ovulation in females from the control group. In hormone-treated groups, 84–100% of fish ovulated, but no differences were observed in ovulation success (P > 0.05). The shortest latency period in treated fish was recorded in the Ovo group (431.6°-hour, P < 0.05). The best results in terms of working fecundity (number of obtained eggs per fish), relative fecundity, fertilization success, hatching rate, and embryo survival up to the eyed stage were achieved in the Ova and Comb1 groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, better survival rates up to the absorbing yolk sac stage and the lowest abnormality of larvae were observed in Ova and Comb1 groups (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incubation time among different groups (P > 0.05). The obtained results indicate that two injections of Ovaprim and/or a priming dose of Ovopel with a resolving dose of Ovaprim are suitable for the artificial reproduction of rudd female breeders. Due to the proper effects and ease of use, two injections of Ovaprim could be recommended for the production of this species for restocking or aquaculture programs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"199","pagesFromTo":"114-120","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676e6d32fdbe8322e23bdd0e","676e6d32fdbe8322e23bdd0f","5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90","676e6d32fdbe8322e23bdd10"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479934","mniswId":"19490","title":"Theriogenology","issn":"0093-691X","eissn":"1879-3231","documentHash":"5a895e76-bf91-415f-9ad3-e560a5ae5bdf"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Artificial spawning","Broodstock management","Cyprinidae","Hormonal agents","Propagation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060268742"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6772718efdbe831015c67c83","name":"Nina","lastName":"Smolińska","documentHash":"704f5472-3464-454e-a55e-e31162ad89e5"},{"objectId":"6772718efdbe831015c67c82","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Kamiński","documentHash":"4204ccda-c428-41b3-a110-66d9303fa187"},{"objectId":"6772718efdbe831015c67c81","name":"Cecilia","lastName":"Dall’Aglio","documentHash":"59845a58-7f36-4e81-bbae-7b33c904c97e"},{"objectId":"6772718efdbe831015c67c80","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Zaobidna","documentHash":"89e224ac-77ac-4fee-9c6b-898003059c15"},{"objectId":"6772718efdbe831015c67c7f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kisielewska","documentHash":"a2dffb7c-b469-4561-b26a-0ca6901bbf2a"},{"objectId":"6772718efdbe831015c67c7e","name":"Marlena","lastName":"Gudelska","documentHash":"4323e7b8-6652-4001-ad4e-540d29a39268"},{"objectId":"6772718efdbe831015c67c7d","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Zarzecka","documentHash":"c1e81057-7161-465f-8f30-7520ed18568c"},{"objectId":"6772718efdbe831015c67c7c","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Kopij","documentHash":"e6804da8-f5bb-4c6e-99de-10311a0b9dcb"},{"objectId":"6772718efdbe831015c67c7b","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kiezun","documentHash":"be228f8e-bef2-44a3-8f1b-d937f564c9e1"},{"objectId":"6772718efdbe831015c67c7a","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Dobrzyń","documentHash":"abd52e4c-734b-436c-aacf-9814312b6794"},{"objectId":"5e7093e1878c28a0473b2809","name":"Karol","lastName":"Makowczenko","uuid":"FC0BCA03095AD65BEC80BF96516EE86332A077895FDBB24C8D84416535FFFBA155B14D24119850FABD9C40FAF93A0FE0C7784D108D1AA03430597DEB9C080EC2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3758-4452","documentHash":"c58ab5e9-6c9b-4e3c-9000-915a43a08071"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-07-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6772718efdbe831015c67c79","doi":"10.1186/s12864-024-10585-8","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85199340998&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Erratum to: Apelin-13 modulates the endometrial transcriptome of the domestic pig during implantation [BMC Genomics 2024, 25: art. no 501 (1-16), doi: 10.1186/s12864-024-10417-9]","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"\"Following publication of the original article it was reported that the Funding declaration was missing.

bioaccessibility of the soluble protein and Maillard reaction products (MRPs) such as furosine (an early indicator of the MR), free FIC (fluorescent intermediate compounds), and FAST index (fluorescence of advanced MRPs and tryptophan), and the level of melanoidins defined by the browning index were analyzed in biscuits formulated from raw and roasted common buckwheat flours fermented by select lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The content of soluble proteins in fermented buckwheat flour and biscuits before and after digestion in vitro was significantly dependent on the LAB applied and the type of flour used and was the highest in the digested biscuits, indicating increased bioaccessibility. Generally, in all analyzed biscuits a lower furosine content was observed as compared to control samples, and its high bioaccessibility was noted after digestion. The free FIC in biscuits was strain-dependent, resulting in low bioaccessibility with the exception of biscuits obtained from both types of flours fermented by Streptococcus thermophilus MK-10. Compared to control biscuits obtained from raw buckwheat flour, the almost twice-increased FAST index was found for samples fermented by L. plantarum IB or Streptococcus thermophilus MK-10. After digestion, at least a fivefold higher value of the browning index was noted in control and tested biscuits, indicating the high bioaccessibility of melanoidins. This study indicates that fermentation of buckwheat flours by selected lactic acid bacteria seems to be a good way to obtain a product with high bioaccessibility of MRPs. However, further research on their functional properties is needed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947f878c28a0473be65c","5e70940d878c28a0473b588a","5e7093f7878c28a0473b41a3","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c25"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"art. no 883 (1-12)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947f878c28a0473be65c","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c25","5e7093f7878c28a0473b41a3","5e70940d878c28a0473b588a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547ccb4","mniswId":"14352","title":"Microorganisms","issn":"2076-2607","websiteLink":"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms","documentHash":"fc214186-f9e6-439f-8fd1-fc949c528a90"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fermentation","buckwheat","baking","Maillard reaction products","bioaccessibility"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060268780"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5aef","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Wróblewska","uuid":"5DB03D00276FB168A632F58946904D68371579A788199D21A9EF92ED0D66A6CE10D4942D9186141FE9863E443F60CBF7B7368A38845839154002943427732A15","documentHash":"56465ee4-d650-4e09-bfd2-a0d6e9de84a5"}],"objectId":"677796ecfdbe833ec1c7ce92","doi":"10.1201/9781003265955-12","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Food Allergens","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Food allergy affects about 7-8% of children and 1-2% of adults. According to the WHO, in the last decade, approximately 240-550 million people worldwide have suffered from a food allergy. Allergic symptoms are reported by about 40% of the population. In Europe, food allergies affect 11-26 million people. The most common sources of food allergens, responsible for 90% of all IgE-mediated food allergies, are milk, egg, soy, fish, peanuts, tree nuts, crustaceans, wheat, mollusks, lupin, celery, sesame, mustard, and sulfates (IV). Food allergy is a potentially life-threatening immunological response that occurs reproducibly upon ingestion of the allergen (Boyce et al., 2010). In the food industry, during technological treatment, raw materials are subjected to numerous physical, chemical, and micrological processes, which cause changes in the food matrix and give new, desirable features to the products. At the same time, the allergenic potential of proteins changes as a result of their partial degradation, aggregation, crosslinking, as well as chemical modifications such as lactosylation, oxidation, or Maillard reactions. This chapter presents the influence of technological processes on the immunoreactive properties of cow’s milk proteins, as an example of industrial influences on raw materials. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Hanna Staroszczyk and Zdzislaw E.

It was noticed that the extraction methods significantly influenced the yield, chemical composition, and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of essential oils. The maximum yield was obtained using superheated steam distillation, followed by hydro-distillation and steam distillation. The antioxidant potential of EO extracts was evaluated following the scavenging of 2,2-dipenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity and ferric reducing power assays. Results revealed that EO extracted superheated steam distillation exhibited the highest antioxidant activity. GC-MS analysis depicted eugenol (47.94–26.50%) and caryophyllene (20.24–9.25%) as the major compounds of Syzygium aromaticum EOs. The antimicrobial activity of EO extracts was evaluated, via the resazurin microtiter plate assay, microdilution broth assay, and disc diffusion methods, against normal and food pathogenic bacterial and fungal strains. After comparative evaluation, it was observed that superheated steam extracted EO exhibited the highest antimicrobial potential. Overall, methodical evaluation disclosed that superheated steam distillation is an effective method to extract EOs from plant sources, with greater yield and promising biological activities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709442878c28a0473b9106"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"art. no 27 (1-15)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67694a8ffdbe8317b9a16b9a","67694a8ffdbe8317b9a16b9b","67694a8ffdbe8317b9a16b9c","67694a8ffdbe8317b9a16b9d","67694a8ffdbe8317b9a16b9e","5e709442878c28a0473b9106"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d2e6","mniswId":"18392","title":"Separations","issn":"2297-8739","eissn":"2227-9075","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fa2b32e1-6f2f-4bff-af6a-f68cda06b47d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["superheated steam distillation","Syzygium aromaticum","essential oil","caryophyllene","antioxidant activity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060268840"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6772707ffdbe831015c67028","name":"Miljana","lastName":"Djordjević","documentHash":"7388ea5b-305c-48ee-853f-8862593e671b"},{"objectId":"6772707ffdbe831015c67027","name":"Marijana","lastName":"Djordjević","documentHash":"ce93b364-dffc-4005-a361-800ef85f3b9f"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9106","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Starowicz","uuid":"4B013299B3042105F83161B8FEC8C2AFE99A43C0731E4233A861F9527288289333FD7AF50660B70486E0E2F9EAA01C3F56B7B36075573598CE5AD9EED841EF89","documentHash":"1dffe897-4b02-48b2-836f-24fe503b9548"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b590c","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Krupa-Kozak","uuid":"824046190EE24412796A8810E9411D9CE05BF23BC9D270DAA5BCB208C989366F8E808ACA30C1F7DF5E6D86B3E899878705B2F6E7827CB1232D8102AD21736584","documentHash":"5eb3692a-f31e-4173-b6e9-435b4fba6984"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6772707ffdbe831015c67026","doi":"10.3390/antiox13020142","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85187244358&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Plant-based antioxidants in gluten-free bread production: sources, technological and sensory aspects, enhancing strategies and constraints","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The recognized contribution of antioxidant compounds to overall health maintenance and spotted deficiencies in celiac patients’ diets has driven more intensive research regarding antioxidant compounds’ inclusion in gluten-free bread (GFB) production during the last decade.

Glucose is the primary energy substrate for contracting muscles, and proper metabolism of glucose is essential for health. Contractile activity and the associated Ca 2+signaling regulate functional capacity and muscle mass. A high concentration of Ca 2+and the presence of calmodulin (CaM) leads to the activation of calcineurin (CaN), a protein with serine-threonine phosphatase activity. The signaling pathway linked with CaN and transcription factors like the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is essential for skeletal muscle development and reprogramming of fast-twitch to slow-twitch fibers. CaN activation may promote metabolic adaptations in muscle cells, resulting in better insulin-stimulated glucose transport. The molecular mechanisms underlying the altered insulin response remain unclear. The role of the CaN/NFAT pathway in regulating skeletal muscle hypertrophy is better described than its involvement in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Thus, there are opportunities for future research in that field. This review presents the role of CaN/NFAT signaling and suggests the relationship with insulin-resistant muscles. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Plant-derived EVs, a hot topic in the field, hold immense capability both as a potential biomarker to study plant physiology and as a biomaterial that can be mass-produced to be used in various industries ranging from cosmetics and food additives to biological pesticides. However, a systematic characterization of plant EVs is required to establish a foundation for further applications and studies. METHODS: In this study, EVs were enriched from hydroponically cultivated potato plants (Solanum tuberosum, cv. Laura). We isolated EVs from root exudates and the apoplastic wash of potato peels using vacuum infiltration. These EVs were then systematically characterized for their biophysical and chemical properties to compare with standard EV characteristics and to explore their roles in plant physiology. RESULTS: Biophysical and chemical analyses revealed morphological similarities between potato root and peel-derived EVs. The average diameter of root-derived EVs (164.6 ± 7.3 nm) was significantly larger than that of peel-derived EVs (132.2 ± 2.0 nm, p < 0.004). Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) demonstrated substantial protein enrichment in purified EVs compared to crude samples, with a 42% enrichment for root EVs and 25% for peel EVs. Only 11.8% of the identified proteins were common between root and peel EVs, with just 2% of significantly enriched proteins shared. Enriched pathways in both EV proteomes were associated with responses to biotic and abiotic stress, suggesting a defensive role of EVs in plants. DISCUSSION: With further experimentation to elucidate the specific methods of communication, these findings increase the details known about plant EVs in terms of their physical and chemical characteristics and their potential functions, aiding in sustainable agricultural waste utilization for large-scale EV production, aligning with the concept of “valorization”."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5af0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"art. no 1477614 (1-17)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67727759fdbe831015c73c21","67727759fdbe831015c73c22","67727759fdbe831015c73c23","67727759fdbe831015c73c24","67727759fdbe831015c73c25","5e709411878c28a0473b5af0","67727759fdbe831015c73c26","67727759fdbe831015c73c27"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d6a","mniswId":"6863","title":"Frontiers in Plant Science","issn":"1664-462X","documentHash":"4eae7099-ad23-452e-8998-3ccadeb33113"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Solanum tuberosum","plant extracellular vesicles","agricultural waste","proteomics","value addition and sustainability","plant biotic and abiotic stress","valorization"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060268880"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67727d6ffdbe831015c79b8f","name":"Vanessa","lastName":"Dias Capriles","documentHash":"4c1640e6-d0f0-4eb4-8ff4-8f7031c23b92"},{"objectId":"67727d6ffdbe831015c79b8e","name":"Luciana","lastName":"Sandri","documentHash":"ac0ab1ea-3b63-4d53-a382-817503c93fbc"},{"objectId":"67727d6ffdbe831015c79b8d","name":"Fernanda","lastName":"Garcia dos Santos","documentHash":"2f302e5d-0bda-49db-a939-3bd014ff6ba0"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b590c","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Krupa-Kozak","uuid":"824046190EE24412796A8810E9411D9CE05BF23BC9D270DAA5BCB208C989366F8E808ACA30C1F7DF5E6D86B3E899878705B2F6E7827CB1232D8102AD21736584","documentHash":"5eb3692a-f31e-4173-b6e9-435b4fba6984"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-10-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67727d6ffdbe831015c79b8c","doi":"10.1016/j.fufo.2024.100475","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Partially defatted chia flour as a novel ingredient for gluten-free breadmaking: Improving sustainability, nutrition and consumer liking","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Partially defatted chia flour (DCF) is a valuable food ingredient in the context of a circular economy, with the potential to improve the nutrient and bioactive contents of gluten-free foodstuff. Thus, this study assessed the effects of interactions between DCF and water content (W) on the physical and sensory properties of gluten-free bread (GFB) and defined, using the response surface method, the composition of formulations that enable quality optimization. A rotatable central composite design was used to assess the main and interaction effects of DCF (ranging from 0 to 28% on a flour basis (fb) and W (ranging from 100 to 200% fb) on the physical properties and consumer linking of rice flour based GFB. The resulting models indicated that higher DCF or W levels diminished the bread quality. However, different W and up to 17.2% DCF can be used to prepare bread with high consumer liking (scores ≥7 for all assessed characteristics, on a scale of 10). The formulation prepared with 0% DCF and 135.5% W (fb) had the highest degree of liking (varying from 8.3 to 9.0). However, when incorporating up to 9.8% DCF and 135.5% W, a high liking can be maintained (scores 8.0 to 8.5 for all characteristics). Acceptable GFB with up to 17.2% DCF in the formulation can be obtained if the W content is adjusted (135 to 139.7% fb). Incorporating 17.2% DCF doubles the fiber content of the GFB.

dietary intervention increases the ability of hyperinsulinemia to suppress serum ghrelin concentration in individuals with obesity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BACKGROUND: Ghrelin is an orexigenic peptide secreted mainly by the stomach. Serum ghrelin concentrations are suppressed after a meal, probably due to insulin release. Individuals with obesity are characterized by a lower fasting serum ghrelin and a lower ghrelin decrease after a meal. The effect of weight loss on the ability of insulin to suppress serum ghrelin concentration remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of weight-reducing dietary intervention on the ability of hyperinsulinemia to suppress serum ghrelin concentration in young individuals with uncomplicated obesity. METHODS: We examined 38 individuals with marked overweight or obesity, who underwent a 12-wk dietary intervention program. Serum ghrelin concentration was measured before and after a 2-h hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp, both pre- and post-intervention. Twenty normal-weight individuals served as a control group and were examined at baseline only. RESULTS: Individuals with overweight/obesity were characterized by a lower fasting serum ghrelin concentration than normal-weight individuals (P = 0.006). Insulin decreased serum ghrelin concentration in both groups (P < 0.001); however, this decrease was markedly lower in individuals with overweight/obesity than in normal-weight individuals (99.70 ± 136.37 vs. 215.45 ± 250.28 pg/mL; P = 0.026). Fasting serum ghrelin concentration increased after the intervention. After weight-reducing dietary intervention, the decrease in serum ghrelin concentration after the clamp was significantly greater than the pre-intervention value (99.70 ± 136.37 vs. 221.82 ± 228.75 pg/mL; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Weight-reducing dietary intervention restores the ability of hyperinsulinemia to suppress serum ghrelin concentration. It may suggest an enhanced feeling of satiety after moderate weight loss in individuals with overweight/obesity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947f878c28a0473be65e","5e709377878c28a0473aa543"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"154","pagesFromTo":"1631-1639","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67728e28fdbe831015c96091","67728e28fdbe831015c96092","5e70947f878c28a0473be65e","5e709377878c28a0473aa543"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547891e","mniswId":"12067","title":"Journal of Nutrition","issn":"0022-3166","eissn":"","documentHash":"8df392c4-ad09-410d-837b-ac416fe3b0b2"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060284738"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6773902dfdbe833e3d15a787","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zabielski","documentHash":"0db20c8f-8f76-4662-958e-eb89f98f861d"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f9","name":"Marta","lastName":"Romaniewicz","uuid":"BA5EC58C9F256FE6720F5651D92CEF665E3BCF665094161E53CC5310C495C2675DB0017F09E02E829694D6D3EB77F7A42E803B09B6B5F16FC2AE40EC63F0BA71","documentHash":"bf5d1b33-4dab-434d-9665-49faf6c0ede9"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a3f","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Krawczyński","uuid":"B39A2940F6E1D8EE972A82348A996648DA00EAC15AF1554C66E1BD9A737911E14185E609D78EFBAEB3E5418FF5F8F41DEBE23A71BAB96845F955DEEB0DAA5F41","orcidId":"0000-0001-5336-7525","documentHash":"583cda81-a5ac-4d4f-a4de-a8432709033e"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":"4C887615D8CF2C7AED96BBBF9BA5C5F08ED58C03893B40229F8B7BC60591947D230EB5884E4543FA7A07891B19A3B7714641EF4DB0922B7E97E35D4B3AAB996B","documentHash":"b2431fda-02ea-4ffb-9f2a-57ed6c3ab5d1"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a82d7","name":"Maria","lastName":"Guzewska","uuid":"0331AD1CF20FB8E16484AD4B8BB8990157C27ADE20D3C2FF54E14B0009ADCFC57AC311BA0F88A6863C3DA0EE012A2B6C858346F4B207B759016275B2164115F4","documentHash":"5b96efe6-ccd8-4a86-adfa-27faa0a4385c"},{"objectId":"5e7092e3878c28a04739ecf8","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Sikora","uuid":"0477FD9FFE311C75BCEAEB7CCAC915B7E23CD31871F999EEC0A00EFF8347BBA925D0EFE321D7071B6BCC7D34D9B151BAEDAB6F3F2741CA9ED5363925B4F14374","documentHash":"752fb097-2b57-40d9-a7e6-3c65d18e6c48"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbbb","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szuszkiewicz","uuid":"B3C96698E29462BF1C5A76532D81BE3E9DC8036C9E04D0956E04E82B221A1A26F6B1C1F1C4D3A3E47C0920C520572C363D5BCBB48E555EBF9346B7C2CB768FEC","documentHash":"06dee320-66e2-49d6-b2fb-510e5e733749"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db9c","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Myszczyński","uuid":"880A7CE391BA7DF745800FB9596A2C112A2B128DE9399F4969165F4F51A342D98754FD80BEBA5C5FAADF1ADB8931FB55C6656B5025D06201AD30A5CDC9A16F71","orcidId":"0000-0002-3118-0900","documentHash":"935ccb74-19cd-46ea-8bd7-c8b1e73a2e49"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6773902dfdbe833e3d15a786","doi":"10.1016/j.mcpro.2024.100879","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"In-depth analysis of miRNA binding sites reveals the complex response of uterine epithelium to miR-26a-5p and miR-125b-5p during early pregnancy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by miRNAs likely makes significant contributions to mRNA abundance at the embryo-maternal interface. In this study, we investigated how miR-26a-5p and miR-125b-5p contribute to molecular changes occurring in the uterine luminal epithelium, which serves as the first site of signal exchange between the mother and developing embryo. To measure de novo protein synthesis after miRNA delivery to primary uterine luminal epithelial cells, we employed pulsed stable isotope labeling by amino acids (pSILAC). We found that both miRNAs alter the proteome of luminal epithelial cells, impacting numerous cellular functions, immune responses, as well as intracellular and second messenger signaling pathways. Additionally, we identified several features of miRNA-mRNA interactions that may influence the targeting efficiency of miR-26a-5p and miR-125b-5p. Overall, our study suggests a complex interaction of miR-26a-5p and miR-125b-5p with their respective targets. However, both appear to cooperatively function in modulating the cellular environment of the luminal epithelium, facilitating the morphological and molecular changes that occur during the intensive communication between the embryo and uterus at pregnancy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d6878c28a04739dbbb","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f9","5e7092e3878c28a04739ecf8","5e70935e878c28a0473a82d7","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89","5e709410878c28a0473b5a3f","5e7092d6878c28a04739db9c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d6878c28a04739db9c","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbbb","5e709410878c28a0473b5a3f","5e7092e3878c28a04739ecf8","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f9","5e70935e878c28a0473a82d7","6773902dfdbe833e3d15a787","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478ed1","mniswId":"14515","title":"Molecular and Cellular Proteomics","issn":"1535-9476","eissn":"1535-9484","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"9d677621-af6d-45c3-bf9e-6a10834f5c56"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pulsed SILAC","miRNA-mRNA interactions","de novo protein synthesis","uterine luminal epithelium","pregnancy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060284752"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6776568afdbe833e6950634c","name":"Sokratis","lastName":"Stergiadis","documentHash":"bd8d217f-c619-4f06-897d-04e00fe722f1"},{"objectId":"6776568afdbe833e6950634b","name":"Darren T.","lastName":"Juniper","documentHash":"2c07c204-52af-4dee-8e37-4bb3835eb5f3"},{"objectId":"6776568afdbe833e6950634a","name":"Anni","lastName":"Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau","documentHash":"30a8fc6d-fd87-4b59-8c50-ee1d19c2af7c"},{"objectId":"6776568afdbe833e69506349","name":"Ásta H.","lastName":"Pétursdóttir","documentHash":"eae154d4-0d83-4438-a157-544f56fc687b"},{"objectId":"6776568afdbe833e69506348","name":"David J.","lastName":"Humphries","documentHash":"a8feb1d3-5038-41ca-b7be-b8aa748caefd"},{"objectId":"6776568afdbe833e69506347","name":"Nanbing","lastName":"Qin","documentHash":"95ea14cb-df6e-4230-9252-d2a8fe6fbd8b"},{"objectId":"6776568afdbe833e69506346","name":"Jane K.","lastName":"Parker","documentHash":"8d054692-4529-4aea-b788-a98978ef3e5c"},{"objectId":"6776568afdbe833e69506345","name":"Sabrina","lastName":"Ormston","documentHash":"7cd64bdb-74ce-4826-aa58-09980fac8dd9"},{"objectId":"6776568afdbe833e69506344","name":"Bing","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"d1cc09c3-63eb-4647-833d-6a8ef3245e83"},{"objectId":"5faa9659085dcb5a2b98d905","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Płatosz","uuid":"5636E30C22C78CF694F4C1F874B2E790B3A5DA6A6A7D86F3BC011852423C7D816C6B80371ACF1FB9C80B5D8B4DFF539900D9DB4AE5465D0A1C2701B3AA4E3FE4","documentHash":"77905b10-f1c1-4e7c-8985-adca2d4dad61"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6776568afdbe833e69506343","doi":"10.1002/jsfa.13556","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Effect of dietary protein source and Saccharina latissima on nutritional and safety characteristics of milk","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BACKGROUND: Wheat distillers' grains (WDG) and seaweeds are recommended as alternative protein sources and enteric methane mitigators in dairy cow diets, respectively, but little is known about their impact on milk quality and safety. In the present study, 16 cows in four 4 × 4 Latin squares were fed isonitrogenous diets (50:50 forage:concentrate ratio), with rapeseed meal (RSM)-based or WDG-based concentrate (230 and 205 g kg−1 dry matter) and supplemented with or without Saccharina latissima. RESULTS: Replacement of RSM with WDG enhanced milk nutritional profile by decreasing milk atherogenicity (P = 0.002) and thrombogenicity (P = 0.019) indices and the concentrations of the nutritionally undesirable saturated fatty acids – specifically, lauric (P = 0.045), myristic (P = 0.022) and palmitic (P = 0.007) acids. It also increased milk concentrations of the nutritionally beneficial vaccenic (P < 0.001), oleic (P = 0.030), linoleic (P < 0.001), rumenic (P < 0.001) and α-linolenic (P = 0.012) acids, and total monounsaturated (P = 0.044), polyunsaturated (P < 0.001) and n-6 (P < 0.001) fatty acids. Feeding Saccharina latissima at 35.7 g per cow per day did not affect the nutritionally relevant milk fatty acids or pose any risk on milk safety, as bromoform concentrations in milk were negligible and unaffected by the dietary treatments. However, it slightly reduced milk concentrations of pantothenate. CONCLUSION: Feeding WDG to dairy cows improved milk fatty acid profiles, by increasing the concentrations of nutritionally beneficial fatty acids and reducing the concentration of nutritionally undesirable saturated fatty acids, while feeding seaweed slightly reduced pantothenate concentrations. However, when considering the current average milk intakes in the population, the milk compositional differences between treatments in this study appear relatively small to have an effect on human health. © 2024 The Authors.

Percidae","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BACKGROUND: The Percidae family comprises many fish species of major importance for aquaculture and fisheries. Based on three new chromosome-scale assemblies in Perca fluviatilis, Perca schrenkii, and Sander vitreus along with additional percid fish reference genomes, we provide an evolutionary and comparative genomic analysis of their sex-determination systems. RESULTS: We explored the fate of a duplicated anti-Mullerian hormone receptor type-2 gene (amhr2bY), previously suggested to be the master sex-determining (MSD) gene in P. flavescens. Phylogenetically related and structurally similar amhr2 duplicates (amhr2b) were found in P. schrenkii and Sander lucioperca, potentially dating this duplication event to their last common ancestor around 19–27 Mya. In P. fluviatilis and S. vitreus, this amhr2b duplicate has been likely lost while it was subject to amplification in S. lucioperca. Analyses of the amhr2b locus in P. schrenkii suggest that this duplication could be also male-specific as it is in P. flavescens. In P. fluviatilis, a relatively small (100 kb) non-recombinant sex-determining region (SDR) was characterized on chromosome 18 using population-genomics approaches. This SDR is characterized by many male-specific single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) and no large duplication/insertion event, suggesting that P. fluviatilis has a male heterogametic sex-determination system (XX/XY), generated by allelic diversification. This SDR contains six annotated genes, including three (c18h1orf198, hsdl1, tbc1d32) with higher expression in the testis than in the ovary. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our results provide a new example of the highly dynamic sex chromosome turnover in teleosts and provide new genomic resources for Percidae, including sex-genotyping tools for all three known Perca species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"art. no 14 (1-17)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67729624fdbe831015ca1ecf","67729624fdbe831015ca1ed0","67729624fdbe831015ca1ed1","67729624fdbe831015ca1ed2","67729624fdbe831015ca1ed3","67729624fdbe831015ca1ed4","67729624fdbe831015ca1ed5","67729624fdbe831015ca1ed6","67729624fdbe831015ca1ed7","67729624fdbe831015ca1ed8","67729624fdbe831015ca1ed9","67729624fdbe831015ca1eda","67729624fdbe831015ca1edb","67729624fdbe831015ca1edc","67729624fdbe831015ca1edd","67729624fdbe831015ca1ede","67729624fdbe831015ca1edf","67729624fdbe831015ca1ee0","67729624fdbe831015ca1ee1","67729624fdbe831015ca1ee2","67729624fdbe831015ca1ee3","67729624fdbe831015ca1ee4","67729624fdbe831015ca1ee5","67729624fdbe831015ca1ee6","5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90","67729624fdbe831015ca1ee7","67729624fdbe831015ca1ee8","67729624fdbe831015ca1ee9","67729624fdbe831015ca1eea","67729624fdbe831015ca1eeb","67729624fdbe831015ca1eec","67729624fdbe831015ca1eed"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773bf","mniswId":"2600","title":"BMC BIOLOGY","issn":"1741-7007","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"ef49be0b-d338-4737-bc97-3034f491f2da"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sex-determination","Genome","Perches","Pikeperches","Sex chromosomes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060284818"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677293defdbe831015c9e1aa","name":"I.","lastName":"Krakowska","documentHash":"1ba83aae-bd20-4973-bc34-3b1599bd6f8d"},{"objectId":"677293defdbe831015c9e1a9","name":"B.

It is still the biggest challenge to design biosensors able to detect two or more analytes in a single measurement. Electrochemical methods are frequently used for this purpose, mainly due to the possibility of applying two or more different redox labels characterized by independent and distinguished electrochemical signals. In addition to antibodies, nucleic acids (aptamers) have been increasingly used as bioreceptors in the construction of such sensors. Within this review paper, we have collected the examples of electrochemical immuno- and geno(apta)sensors for simultaneous detection of multiple analytes. Based on many published literature examples, we have emphasized the recent application of multiplexed platforms for detection of cancer biomarkers. It has allowed us to compare the progress in design strategies, including novel nanomaterials and amplification of signals, to get as low as possible limits of detection. We have focused on multi-electrode and multi-label strategies based on redox-active labels, such as ferrocene, anthraquinone, methylene blue, thionine, hemin and quantum dots, or metal ions such as Ag+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Cu2+ and others.

Current treatments for diseases related to this system have shown several limitations; therefore, there is a rising need for novel methods. In this circumstance, RNA-based therapeutics have rapidly emerged as new and promising candidates. In fact, to date, a handful of potential drugs have passed the development step and entered the clinical pipeline. Among them, one drug received FDA approval to enter the global market, which is Oxlumo (Lumasiran) for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1. For other excretory diseases, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, urothelial cancer or renal cancer, RNA-based candidates are also being tested under clinical trials. Currently, the most potential types of RNA therapeutics to treat disorders of the excretory system are those based on small interfering RNA (siRNA), antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) and messenger RNA (mRNA), Among them, siRNA therapeutics seem to be the most promising, including Oxlumo and two other developing drug candidates.

Four hundred 1-day-old female birds (Ross 308) were randomly allotted to 4 dietary treatments (10 replicate pens, 10 birds each). The trial was set up as follows: negative control (NC), basal diet without any feed additive; NC+Pro, basal diet with B. licheniformis (500 g/t of diet); NC+Phy, basal diet with 6-phytase (400 g/t of diet); and NC+Pro+Phy, basal diet in which both experimental factors were added at the same levels as above. The interaction between treatments was noted in each evaluated period regarding BWG and FI. In the entire experiment, an increased body weight gain (P < 0.001) was observed in the NC+Pro+Phy treatment compared to the other groups. The birds that received both feed additives combined were characterized by an increased feed intake (P < 0.001), contrary to NC+Pro and NC+Phy. Moreover, in terms of microenvironment modulations, interactions (P < 0.05) were observed in the jejunal and cecal digesta pH, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) level, and microbial enzyme activities. However, the impacts of B. licheniformis and phytase on cecal SCFA concentrations and bacterial enzymes were mainly opposite. There were no interactions (P < 0.05) in terms of geometrical, mechanical, and structural selected tibia and femur indices. However, 6-phytase addition improved bone structure, stiffness, and elasticity. In conclusion, the interactions between 6-phytase and B. licheniformis positively affect growth performance via microbial activity changes; however, the supportive bone quality maintenance properties are only connected to 6-phytase supplementation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b59eb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"289","pagesFromTo":"art. no 105586 (1-15)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6776508cfdbe833e694feaf5","6776508cfdbe833e694feaf6","6776508cfdbe833e694feaf7","6776508cfdbe833e694feaf8","6776508cfdbe833e694feaf9","5e709410878c28a0473b59eb","6776508cfdbe833e694feafa"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d0f","mniswId":"13726","title":"Livestock Science","issn":"1871-1413","eissn":"1878-0490","documentHash":"02fff2c1-dbd2-4330-9520-3cd219e7025b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Feed additives","Probiotic","Phytase","Broiler chicken","Performance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060285223"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677649edfdbe833e694fad2d","name":"Nafis A.","lastName":"Rahman","documentHash":"ea27fa2f-7c51-40c8-9ca8-f89f4d2da984"},{"objectId":"677649edfdbe833e694fad2c","name":"Adam","lastName":"Pawelczyk","documentHash":"f71bf04c-160f-4228-93d7-0c3b7a574154"},{"objectId":"677649edfdbe833e694fad2b","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Milewska","documentHash":"8f50b5a3-4f51-42a1-b73c-6ddaebf8cc96"},{"objectId":"677649edfdbe833e694fad2a","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bernaczyk","documentHash":"89c92ed4-7a94-49b9-b946-4b30f4c5dce8"},{"objectId":"677649edfdbe833e694fad29","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Szucio","documentHash":"929d1e4a-5694-4df6-84cf-3de0b00daa81"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7","name":"Donata","lastName":"Ponikwicka-Tyszko","uuid":"4C35B3EDE357FD25F5812AD7BFAA18400890491C49FE69152441B7233A793EFD09392BB58F197C713C5EE6E5927A0395F623A44B7AD99CE5C735682C01E90555","documentHash":"e93e992c-e87b-4c53-bd72-ba444a6e657b"},{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa22d","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Wołczyński","uuid":"0A871C45586D0E0C489B63B399620DE1A57EB6EA9F54E9ABD37814521E7B39A00AEAD76DAE770B6D94F9C8BA404BA29FB0969CEAD79D8480D41478AF84369537","orcidId":"0000-0002-7806-1394","documentHash":"81f0e7ff-f534-405d-ac46-4a36a5d25ad5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"677649edfdbe833e694fad28","doi":"10.1016/j.advms.2024.01.001","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85182976505&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Progesterone signaling in uterine leiomyoma biology: Implications for potential targeted therapy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Uterine leiomyomas (ULs) are the most common benign smooth muscle cell steroid-dependent tumors that occur in women of reproductive age.

Data on the membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs) regulated signaling pathways in ULs in the available literature is still very limited. One of the essential characteristics of ULs is the excessive production of extracellular matrix (ECM). P4 has been shown to stimulate ECM production and collagen synthesis in ULs. Recent research demonstrated that, despite their benign nature, ULs may present with abnormal vasculature. P4 has been shown to regulate angiogenesis in ULs through the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and by controlling the secretion of permeability factors. This review summarizes the key findings regarding the role of PGRs and mPRs in ULs, especially highlighting the potential ECM and angiogenesis modulation by P4. An increased understanding of this mechanistic role of nuclear and specifically mPRs in the biology of P4-modulated ECM and angiogenesis in the growth of ULs could turn out to be fundamental for developing effective targeted therapies for ULs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa22d","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"69","pagesFromTo":"21-28","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677649edfdbe833e694fad29","677649edfdbe833e694fad2a","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7","677649edfdbe833e694fad2b","677649edfdbe833e694fad2c","5e709375878c28a0473aa22d","677649edfdbe833e694fad2d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476ec9","mniswId":"512","title":"Advances in Medical Sciences","issn":"1896-1126","documentHash":"ada13270-a81f-45d3-808c-4094fffc847c"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Extracellular matrix","Leiomyomas","Progesterone","Progesterone receptors","SPRM"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060285258"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6772916ffdbe831015c98ca1","name":"Alireza","lastName":"Fazeli","documentHash":"750ad91a-7de1-4402-9623-7fd2d832eb0c"},{"objectId":"6772916ffdbe831015c98ca0","name":"Amber Rose","lastName":"Hart","documentHash":"6dcb8385-8c62-4220-b274-04537dede0b8"},{"objectId":"6772916ffdbe831015c98c9f","name":"Suranga","lastName":"Kodithuwakku","documentHash":"b8e9a4c4-87e7-4439-84b5-6c0ed618ebdb"},{"objectId":"6772916ffdbe831015c98c9e","name":"Paul R.","lastName":"Heath","documentHash":"8fc24333-551d-4908-a0d7-6f1b10448245"},{"objectId":"6772916ffdbe831015c98c9d","name":"Getnet","lastName":"Midekessa","documentHash":"4cfb13f6-8d85-4c32-87e6-8d1dfcee8320"},{"objectId":"6772916ffdbe831015c98c9c","name":"Kasun","lastName":"Godakumara","documentHash":"bada9d71-8d87-45b2-bfce-972a58300374"},{"objectId":"6772916ffdbe831015c98c9b","name":"Keerthie","lastName":"Dissanayake","documentHash":"23f054bd-2f40-49c1-b123-9eac30e94049"},{"objectId":"6772916ffdbe831015c98c9a","name":"Subhashini","lastName":"Muhandiram","documentHash":"1ac52e81-a662-4c35-8d1c-d4b813ccff13"},{"objectId":"6772916ffdbe831015c98c99","name":"Norhayati Liaqat Ali","lastName":"Khan","documentHash":"b4dbad41-a74e-4a09-aa8a-7af4ee61b705"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5af0","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Andronowska","uuid":"FED2FCAE6B5DD0135A4EFBF728ABE3CD84F3632BC016B99F64D43ACE18BE814653A6357A19ED098836C69D0922559315762EE4FC0E18D9A07A5470B86F46C8AA","documentHash":"3f8bf776-486a-4bde-953d-9dc774171f3e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6772916ffdbe831015c98c98","doi":"10.3389/fcell.2024.1382552","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Effect of 3D and 2D cell culture systems on trophoblast extracellular vesicle physico-chemical characteristics and potency","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The growing understanding of the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in embryo-maternal communication has sparked considerable interest in their therapeutic potential within assisted reproductive technology, particularly in enhancing implantation success. However, the major obstacle remains the large-scale production of EVs, and there is still a gap in understanding how different culture systems affect the characteristics of the EVs. In the current study, trophoblast analogue human chorionic carcinoma cell line was cultivated in both conventional monolayer culture (2D) and as spheroids in suspension culture (3D) and how the cell growth environment affects the physical, biochemical and cellular signalling properties of EVs produced by them was studied. Interestingly, the 3D system was more active in secreting EVs compared to the 2D system, while no significant differences were observed in terms of morphology, size, and classical EV protein marker expression between EVs derived from the two culture systems. There were substantial differences in the proteomic cargo profile and cellular signalling potency of EVs derived from the two culture systems. Notably, 2D EVs were more potent in inducing a cellular response in endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) compared to 3D EVs. Therefore, it is essential to recognize that the biological activity of EVs depends not only on the cell of origin but also on the cellular microenvironment of the parent cell. In conclusion, caution is warranted when selecting an EV production platform, especially for assessing the functional and therapeutic potential of EVs through in vitro studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej

Here, we demonstrate the development of universal pan-mammalian clocks, using 11,754 methylation arrays from our Mammalian Methylation Consortium, which encompass 59 tissue types across 185 mammalian species. These predictive models estimate mammalian tissue age with high accuracy (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> &gt; 0.96). Age deviations correlate with human mortality risk, mouse somatotropic axis mutations and caloric restriction. We identified specific cytosines with methylation levels that change with age across numerous species. These sites, highly enriched in polycomb repressive complex 2-binding locations, are near genes implicated in mammalian development, cancer, obesity and longevity. Our findings offer new evidence suggesting that aging is evolutionarily conserved and intertwined with developmental processes across all mammals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w

Seeds as Alternative Ingredients in a Fibre-Rich Diet: Protein Quality and Metabolic Effects in Rats","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>We verified whether milk thistle seeds and pot marigold seeds provided valuable components for a fibre-rich diet and how their addition affected body composition, nitrogen balance and lipid metabolism in rats. Growing rats were fed a control diet (5% fibre) or three fibre-rich diets (24% fibre), which contained cellulose as the sole source of fibre (24%; positive control), milk thistle seeds (32%) or pot marigold seeds (39%). All diets were balanced in macronutrients, including total protein content (9%), which was half of the amount recommended for rats to maximise protein absorption and utilisation, and the ratio of plant protein to animal protein (approx. 1:1). After 4 weeks, dietary pot marigold seeds reduced body weight gain, which translated into lower gains of body fat and lean mass in rats (all at p ≤ 0.05). Protein digestibility differed among individual fibre-rich diets (p ≤ 0.05), with the lowest result having been recorded for dietary pot marigold seeds (73%), followed by dietary milk thistle seeds (78%), and the highest result having been recorded for dietary soybean protein isolate (control protein source, 89%). Nitrogen retention was higher with dietary soybean protein isolate (53%) and dietary milk thistle seeds (47%) than with dietary pot marigold seeds (38%) (p ≤ 0.05). In the caecal digesta, the concentrations of the major short-chain fatty acids were almost or &gt;2-fold higher after dietary milk thistle seeds and pot marigold seeds than after the positive control diet (all at p ≤ 0.05). Dietary pot marigold seeds enlarged the liver and increased the plasma activities of liver enzymes but reduced hepatic lipid contents (all at p ≤ 0.05). Certain Asteraceae seeds provide components of varied nutritional quality, with milk thistle seeds being a relatively good source of protein and both types of seeds being a source of fermentable fibre. Pot marigold seeds have potential anti-obesogenic effects, but with the risk of damaging internal organs.</jats:p>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w

genetic diversity in endangered species including the critically endangered group of sturgeons (Acipenseridae), but it can compromise sperm quality and protein profiles. Although cryopreservation with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and methanol (MeOH) results in the recovery of good post-thaw motility, DMSO-preserved sperm show reduced fertilization ability. This study was conducted in Siberian sturgeon as a model for Acipenserid fishes to explore the effects of DMSO and MeOH on the proteome of semen using advanced proteomics methods—liquid chromatography‒mass spectrometry and two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis. We analyzed the proteomic profiles of fresh and cryopreserved spermatozoa and their extracellular medium and showed that cryopreservation decreases motility and viability and increases reactive oxygen species levels, membrane fluidity, and acrosome damage. Despite having similar post-thaw semen motility, sperm treated with DMSO had significantly lower fertilization success (6.2%) than those treated with MeOH (51.2%). A total of 224 and 118 differentially abundant proteins were identified in spermatozoa preserved with MeOH and DMSO, respectively. MeOH-related proteins were linked to chromosomal structure and mitochondrial functionality, while DMSO-related proteins impacted fertilization by altering the acrosome reaction and binding of sperm to the zona pellucida and nuclear organization. Additionally, cryopreservation led to alterations in the proacrosin/acrosin system in both cryoprotectants. This study provides the first comprehensive proteomic characterization of Siberian sturgeon sperm after cryopreservation, offering insights into how cryoprotectants impact fertilization ability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","uid":"bKH7OhxrOAmP_ULnBGYKnJQ","uuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","name":"Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki Polskiej Akademii

cytidine deaminases that catalyse the deamination of bases in nucleic acids, resulting in a cytidine to uridine transition. Secreted novel AID/APOBEC-like deaminases (SNADs), characterized by the presence of a signal peptide are unique among all of intracellular classical AID/APOBECs, which are the central part of antibody diversity and antiviral defense. To date, there is no available knowledge on SNADs including protein characterization, biochemical characteristics and catalytic activity. We used various in silico approaches to define the phylogeny of SNADs, their common structural features, and their potential structural variations in fish species. Our analysis provides strong evidence of the universal presence of SNAD1 proteins/transcripts in fish, in which expression commences after hatching and is highest in anatomical organs linked to the immune system. Moreover, we searched published fish data and identified previously, “uncharacterized proteins” and transcripts as SNAD1 sequences. Our review into immunological research suggests SNAD1 role in immune response to infection or immunization, and interactions with the intestinal microbiota. We also noted SNAD1 association with temperature acclimation, environmental pollution and sex-based expression differences, with females showing higher level. To validate in silico predictions we performed expression studies of several SNAD1 gene variants in carp, which revealed distinct patterns of responses under different conditions. Dual sensitivity to environmental and pathogenic stress highlights its importance in the fish and potentially enhancing thermotolerance and immune defense. Revealing the biological roles of SNADs represents an exciting new area of research related to the role of DNA and/or RNA editing in fish biology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","uid":"b4-9zzGvUfyUhirAhWcr-QA","uuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","name":"Instytut Chemii Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70945e878c28a0473bb86d","5e709349878c28a0473a6856"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","parentUuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","rootUuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a40","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","5e709444878c28a0473b9457"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1340273","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709444878c28a0473b9457","5e709410878c28a0473b5a40","6620ca1c40970763236528bf","5e709349878c28a0473a6856","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","5e70945e878c28a0473bb86d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d5d","mniswId":"6843","title":"Frontiers in Immunology","issn":"1664-3224","eissn":"1664-3224","documentHash":"6b154b99-72d3-4a42-8bcc-3211ee11bd8a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"660d034b4097070346510dba","year":"2024","volume":"15","documentHash":"745365b3-8dfb-4d44-8f5c-15aaa79768f3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["secreted cytidine deaminase 1 (SNAD1)","nucleic acids editing","fish","infection","immunology","immune responses"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060353295"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e95aefdbe8322e23d1076","name":"Leonard A.","lastName":"Harris","documentHash":"ec0edf06-666e-444b-ac5b-942e6959277b"},{"objectId":"676e95aefdbe8322e23d1075","name":"Alfredo","lastName":"Rodríguez","documentHash":"c85c6fa7-7f53-4f53-8b27-903730ebd0c7"},{"objectId":"676e95aefdbe8322e23d1074","name":"Elisa","lastName":"Domínguez-Hüttinger","documentHash":"04d4bff8-373b-491c-a25e-312a073158e8"},{"objectId":"676e95aefdbe8322e23d1073","name":"Eunike","lastName":"Velleuer","documentHash":"19c27410-d5a2-4cde-b747-4a2245165f17"},{"objectId":"6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","name":"Carsten","lastName":"Carlberg","uuid":"7A3E0E7963E1192270F3903EEFFAA1A086E27754D1B393FD104F68B8A691171F30A075FDFF073A66B06C35CCE685244FF4287E47226B5FB73CCE42A85608CA83","documentHash":"50649f30-9531-42e7-8c6c-543c2bbfecb8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e95aefdbe8322e23d1072","doi":"10.3389/fgene.2023.1254966","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85177074460&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Concepts of multi-level dynamical modelling: understanding mechanisms of squamous cell carcinoma development in Fanconi anemia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare disease (incidence of 1:300,000) primarily based on the inheritance of pathogenic variants in genes of the FA/BRCA (breast cancer) pathway. These variants ultimately reduce the functionality of different proteins involved in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks and DNA double-strand breaks. At birth, individuals with FA might present with typical malformations, particularly radial axis and renal malformations, as well as other physical abnormalities like skin pigmentation anomalies. During the first decade of life, FA mostly causes bone marrow failure due to reduced capacity and loss of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. This often makes hematopoietic stem cell transplantation necessary, but this therapy increases the already intrinsic risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in early adult age. Due to the underlying genetic defect in FA, classical chemo-radiation-based treatment protocols cannot be applied. Therefore, detecting and treating the multi-step tumorigenesis process of SCC in an early stage, or even its progenitors, is the best option for prolonging the life of adult FA individuals. However, the small number of FA individuals makes classical evidence-based medicine approaches based on results from randomized clinical trials impossible. As an alternative, we introduce here the concept of multi-level dynamical modelling using large, longitudinally collected genome, proteome- and transcriptome-wide data sets from a small number of FA individuals. This mechanistic modelling approach is based on the “hallmarks of cancer in FA”, which we derive from our unique database of the clinical history of over 750 FA individuals. Multi-omic data from healthy and diseased tissue samples of FA individuals are to be used for training constituent models of a multi-level tumorigenesis model, which will then be used to make experimentally testable predictions. In this way, mechanistic models facilitate not only a descriptive but also a functional understanding of SCC in FA. This approach will provide the basis for detecting signatures of SCCs at early stages and their precursors so they can be efficiently treated or even prevented, leading to a better prognosis and quality of life for the FA individual.

In this study, flowers and leaves of R. arboreum were selected from the Mussoorie area in the district of Dehradun (Uttarakhand). Plant extracts were obtained by using hexane, distilled water, acetone, 80% methanol and ethyl acetate solvents in an orbital shaker. The activity of the extracts against Bacillus cereus, Shigella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli was investigated using an agar well diffusion procedure, and the synergistic interaction of the extracts with conventional antibiotics, including norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, was examined. Phytochemicals of R. arboreum were obtained from PubChem, and a target protein was rebuilt using the RCSB protein data bank. The docking approach was carried out via AutoDock vina software with penicillin binding protein (3VSL) to validate the microbe interactions and bioactive molecules, whereas Molinspiration and Swiss ADME servers were used to determine the Lipinski rule of 5 and perform drug-likeness analysis, respectively. Protox II and AdmetSAR tools were used to screen phytoconstituent toxicity. Flower and leaf extracts exhibited the highest yields (3.06 ± 0.9% and 2.53 ± 1.01%, respectively) in methanol. Phenolics, alkaloids, carbohydrates, flavonoids, steroids, amino acids, cardiac glycosides, tannin, protein, and saponin were qualitatively found. Synergistic activity against B. cereus and E. coli was observed for aqueous leaf extracts, while methanol, ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of flowers and leaves exhibited synergism against Shigella and S. aureus. Ethyl acetate extracts of flowers and leaves are the best synergistic enhancer. According to in silico data obtained from an in silico study, the best phytocompounds and prospective antibacterial agents are epifriedelanol and campanulin. © 2023 The Author(s)"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"161","pagesFromTo":"711-719","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676e60e9fdbe8322e23bb883","676e60e9fdbe8322e23bb884","676e60e9fdbe8322e23bb885","676e60e9fdbe8322e23bb886","676e60e9fdbe8322e23bb887","676e60e9fdbe8322e23bb888","676e60e9fdbe8322e23bb889","676e60e9fdbe8322e23bb88a","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","676e60e9fdbe8322e23bb88b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454797cb","mniswId":"18733","title":"SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY","issn":"0254-6299","documentHash":"9b85f7ad-aed7-40d5-bd7f-139ff5d11a3f"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Antibiotics","Antioxidant activity","Phytochemicals","Plant extracts","Synergism"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060356938"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6769617dfdbe8317b9a29b83","name":"José M.","lastName":"Lorenzo","documentHash":"1eab3408-dfac-438f-ab15-405ce6f033a0"},{"objectId":"6769617dfdbe8317b9a29b82","name":"Jane .M.","lastName":"Misihairabgwi","documentHash":"332a6791-33da-4df6-b563-8639716f0710"},{"objectId":"6769617dfdbe8317b9a29b81","name":"Mirian","lastName":"Pateiro","documentHash":"66b90e3e-fea3-4bbc-8699-72bb4278ea0e"},{"objectId":"6769617dfdbe8317b9a29b80","name":"Beatriz","lastName":"Gullón","documentHash":"72eecffb-ed05-4f5a-80bf-af4764735a6b"},{"objectId":"6769617dfdbe8317b9a29b7f","name":"Noemi","lastName":"Echegaray","documentHash":"d9e3adf7-e154-47f5-854a-f085ad094038"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"objectId":"6769617dfdbe8317b9a29b7e","doi":"10.1080/87559129.2021.1934003","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85107701199&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Date Fruit and Its By-products as Promising Source of Bioactive Components: A Review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Date palm tree (Phoenix dactylifera) has traditionally been grown in South-West Asia and North Africa, principally for date fruit consumption. Nevertheless, its cultivation has recently spread to other areas of America, sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania and Southern Europe.

These wastes, together with the date fruit, constitute an important source of biocomponents such as hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids, flavonoids, tannins, carotenoids, tocopherols, tocotrienols, phytosterols and phytoestrogens. This review provides detailed information about the sensory properties, nutritional profile and biocompounds with health-promoting properties present in date fruit and its by-products. Furthermore, recent findings regarding the potential of these products to develop new functional foodstuffs was also highlighted. Several studies have reported that the date fruit and its by-products present an outstanding richness in bioactive compounds with potential healthy properties that make them suitable to be used as nutraceutical ingredients in several foodstuffs. Their incorporation in the formulation of foods would contribute to cover the increasing demand of consumers by products elaborated with natural ingredients.

Since the origin of our species most of these nutrient-gene communication pathways have not changed. However, our genome experienced over the past 50,000 years a number of evolutionary pressures, which are based on the migration to new environments concerning geography and climate, the transition from hunter-gatherers to farmers including the zoonotic transfer of many pathogenic microbes and the rather recent change of societies to a preferentially sedentary lifestyle and the dominance of Western diet. Human populations responded to these challenges not only by specific anthropometric adaptations, such as skin color and body stature, but also through diversity in dietary intake and different resistance to complex diseases like the metabolic syndrome, cancer and immune disorders. The genetic basis of this adaptation process has been investigated by whole genome genotyping and sequencing including that of DNA extracted from ancient bones. In addition to genomic changes, also the programming of epigenomes in pre- and postnatal phases of life has an important contribution to the response to environmental changes. Thus, insight into the variation of our (epi)genome in the context of our individual's risk for developing complex diseases, helps to understand the evolutionary basis how and why we become ill. This review will discuss the relation of diet, modern environment and our (epi)genome including aspects of redox biology.

Usually, they are produced in small dairy plants which are characterized by a unique microbiota of the processing area. The unique microbiota determines both the microbial quality and safety of the final products. Another issue related to the microbiological safety of food products is the presence of antibiotic resistance (AR) in microbiota, which is a potential health issue for humans. The AR was mainly investigated in pathogenic bacteria as a direct risk for effective antimicrobial therapy. However, the AR phenomenon is also present in desired food bacteria participating in the production of dairy products. These bacteria can be a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in the environment, therefore monitoring AR in LABs seems to be an urgent need for ensuring the safety of food. In this work, we investigated the microbial diversity of ripened and unripened cheeses produced from cow, ewe, and goat milk in Poland, and identified LAB typical for cheeses and microbiota characteristic of the investigated types of cheese. Moreover, we assessed the phenotypic AR and the presence of ARG in lactic acid bacteria. ABSTRACT: (1) Unique sensory values of traditional and regional dairy products made them more and more popular among consumers. Lactic acid bacteria naturally occurring in these products can express antibiotic resistance and be a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in the environment. The aim of the study was to characterize the microbial diversity of twenty regional cheeses produced from non-pasteurized cow, goat and ewe milk, and investigate the phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance (AR) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from these products. (2) Conventional microbiological methods were applied for the enumeration of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli and lactococci) and their isolation, and for the enumeration of Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae and spores. The disc diffusion method was applied for phenotypic AR. The PCR-based methods were used for strain identification, microbiological diversity of cheeses (PCR-DGGE), and for AR gene detection. (3) Among 79 LAB isolates the most frequent species were L. plantarum (n = 18), Leuc. lactis (n = 17), Lc. lactis (n = 11), Leuc. mesenteroides (n = 9) and L. pentosus (n = 8). Additionally, by using the PCR-DGGE method, DNA of L. casei was found in nine products. Lactobacilli (5.63–8.46 log cfu/g) and lactococci (6.15–8.41 log cfu/g) predominated over Enterococcus (max. 4.89 log cfu/g), Staphylococcus (max. 4.18 log cfu/g), and Enterobacteriaceae (mostly up to 4.88 log cfu/g). Analysis of phenotypic resistance to tetracycline (30 µg), erythromycin (15 µg), and chloramphenicol (30 µg) showed that 29% of LAB isolates were resistant to one antibiotic, 8%—to two, and 12%—to all tested antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance genes (AGR) for tetracycline (tet(M), tet(L), tet(W)), erythromycin (erm(B)) and chloramphenicol (cat-TC) were detected in 30 (38%), 29 (36.7%) and 33 (43.4%) LAB isolates, respectively. Among 31 LAB isolates phenotypically susceptible to all tested antibiotics, only 5 (16%) had no ARGs. (4) The results obtained in our work shed light on the potential threat posed by the widespread presence of ARGs in LAB present in regional cheeses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b590a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art. no 168 (1-16)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676e6a4cfdbe8322e23bd3da","5e70940f878c28a0473b590a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["oscypek","redykołka","tvarog","bryndza","regional cheese","lactic acid bacteria","antibiotic resistance","food safety"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357118"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676ea064fdbe8322e23d7ebf","name":"Maryna P.","lastName":"Petrushko","documentHash":"79ae41af-13d0-4b79-a43b-70da78bb0078"},{"objectId":"628ee628752340212ccc8096","name":"Taisiia","lastName":"Yurchuk","uuid":"592256FCADFD930F5303A5ED638B24A09E64493741C5EDA50A913E9A0C5042BB7BA42CD90691FB232A09E900CAD930B9628E4E6C15700F6C6A37F0DD1F9B6D35","documentHash":"31bf5294-1387-49ef-bd5c-f6e3bc45b147"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676ea064fdbe8322e23d7ebe","doi":"10.15407/cryo33.03.177","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85179331971&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Quarter-Century Experience in Cryopreservation of Human Oocytes by Vitrification.

In this study, flaxseed oil cake (FOC), a by-product of flaxseed oil extraction and a source of nutritional and functional compounds, was used as an ingredient in the experimental bread formulation as partial replacement of starches (5%, 15%, and 30%). The gluten-free breads (GFBs) were evaluated for technological parameters, nutritional value, and sensory quality. Compared with the control, all FOC-enhanced GFBs were significantly (p < 0.05) richer in proteins, fat, and dietary fibre, with an increase that was proportional to the concentration of FOC in the formulation. At low-to-moderate levels (5% and 15%), FOC improved the specific volume, texture characteristics (reduced crumb hardness, gumminess, and chewiness), and appearance of GFBs, which allowed us to ameliorate its sensory features, but at 30% of FOC, the quality of the crumb texture decreased significantly (p < 0.005). Among the experimental GFBs, FOC15% exhibited improved technological characteristics and was rated by the sensory panel as the best in terms of overall quality. The results of the conducted research highlighted the benefits of incorporating FOC into GFB as a promising approach to developing a palatable, high-quality bakery product that may be a healthier option for individuals on a gluten-free diet, offering nutritional benefits. Nevertheless, it should be emphasised that the amount of FOC in GFB requires careful regulation. © 2023 by the authors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b590c","5e7094a8878c28a0473c121e","5e709442878c28a0473b9106","676e7064fdbe8322e23bee3b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art. no 4320 (1-14)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676e7064fdbe8322e23bee3b","5e709442878c28a0473b9106","5e7094a8878c28a0473c121e","676e7064fdbe8322e23bee3c","676e7064fdbe8322e23bee3d","676e7064fdbe8322e23bee3e","5e70940f878c28a0473b590c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"FOODS","issn":"2304-8158","websiteLink":"https://doi.org/10.3390/foods8100467","documentHash":"ef1a9e8c-2661-4476-b116-692933ac116b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bakery products","by-product revalorisation","gluten elimination","oilseed cake","plant-based by-products","sensory features","textural profile"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357312"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676ea91cfdbe8322e23db552","name":"Rachna","lastName":"Verma","documentHash":"b18845ed-3b6f-4813-82c3-8ab3f08e912c"},{"objectId":"676ea91cfdbe8322e23db551","name":"Dinesh","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"b2a021f4-b3b6-4714-95f7-ab0b2cf7ebb7"},{"objectId":"676ea91cfdbe8322e23db550","name":"Nazam","lastName":"Khan","documentHash":"02241e92-1e72-4c8c-a5be-7126a21fa50c"},{"objectId":"676ea91cfdbe8322e23db54f","name":"Vedpriya","lastName":"Arya","documentHash":"49febb88-0114-44c3-aeed-c92fbb99c0db"},{"objectId":"676ea91cfdbe8322e23db54e","name":"Ashwani","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"bd2229eb-2629-4cd8-bc62-2b1b096aa9c8"},{"objectId":"676ea91cfdbe8322e23db54d","name":"Akansha","lastName":"Rohela","documentHash":"85d42b6c-bc1b-4ca9-8b1e-7b2422b62c53"},{"objectId":"676ea91cfdbe8322e23db54c","name":"Rashmi","lastName":"Verma","documentHash":"64bf3530-4b85-4b80-a905-a49c7150cef3"},{"objectId":"676ea91cfdbe8322e23db54b","name":"Priyanka","lastName":"Rai","documentHash":"33c703b1-a932-4577-8430-147c8c6467c4"},{"objectId":"676ea91cfdbe8322e23db54a","name":"Acharya","lastName":"Balkrishna","documentHash":"2fb07368-88ce-4351-bc20-493380190e76"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"objectId":"676ea91cfdbe8322e23db549","doi":"10.1007/s11101-024-09968-2","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Mechanistic insight into anti-inflammatory potential, phytochemistry and ethnomedicinal status of Ilex species: a review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Inflammation assists in the healing process as a part of the natural defensive mechanism. Apart from the healing process, inflammatory mechanisms contribute to the progression and development of a range of ailments, including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and so on. A new anti-inflammatory medication that is safe, potent, non-toxic, or less toxic is now required as the existing anti-inflammatory and non-steroidal drugs are associated with various side effects. In this context, we have reviewed the genus Ilex for traditional uses related to inflammation and anti-inflammatory properties (in vitro and in vivo) by utilizing databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct. According to ethnomedicinal information, these plants have been used to treat various inflammatory conditions. A total of 12 species were found with anti-inflammatory potential, where some studies were conducted using crude extracts and others with pure compounds. Many chemical compounds have been reported from the Ilex species; however, the bioactive composition explored for anti-inflammatory effects include rotundarpene, triterpenoid saponins, chlorogenic acid, ursolic acid, ilexgenin A, isoquercetin, kaempferol, ilexchinenosides J-Q and salicifoneoliganol. The mechanistic insights into how Ilex species deal with inflammatory stimuli in the mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-κB, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription, and arachidonic acid pathways have also been highlighted. The toxicity profile of studies has also been discussed to assess safety.

We examined 1) the action of toluene (at doses 0, 10, and 100 ng/ml), 2) flaxseed extract (10 μg/ml), and their combination on cultured human ovarian granulosa cells. Methods: Viability, markers of proliferation (accumulation of PCNA) and apoptosis (accumulation of bax), the release of steroid hormones, IGF-I, oxytocin, and prostaglandin F were analyzed by Trypan blue exclusion test, quantitative immunocytochemistry, and EIA/ELISA. Results: Toluene suppressed all analyzed ovarian parameters. Flaxseed stimulated proliferation, progesterone and IGF-I and reduced prostaglandin F output. The presence of flaxseed supported toluene action on cell viability and apoptosis and inverted its effect on proliferation, progesterone, testosterone, and IGF-I release. Conclusion: These observations a) confirm direct inhibitory/toxic action of toluene on ovarian cells, b) demonstrate the ability of flaxseed to affect ovarian cell functions, c) show the ability of flaxseed to prevent some toxic effect of toluene, and d) indicate the that flaxseed could be a bi-ostimulator of human reproduction and protector against the adverse influence of toluene on female reproduction. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"art. no e020123212322 (1-xx)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67696300fdbe8317b9a2b59e","67696300fdbe8317b9a2b59f","67696300fdbe8317b9a2b5a0","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c28","67696300fdbe8317b9a2b5a1","67696300fdbe8317b9a2b5a2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547da8b","mniswId":"21855","title":"Current Bioactive Compounds","issn":"1573-4072","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"d2244463-e714-4c82-ae33-96020c8f6651"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["apoptosis","flaxseed","hormones","human ovary","proliferation","Toluene"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357395"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676ea7cffdbe8322e23da876","name":"Amita","lastName":"Kumari","documentHash":"340c3e6a-eed7-4d7b-a1ff-59f6d30cc313"},{"objectId":"676ea7cffdbe8322e23da875","name":"Priyanka","lastName":"Rai","documentHash":"492e3ebb-97e9-4017-a69c-6036356d47f5"},{"objectId":"676ea7cffdbe8322e23da874","name":"Hemant","lastName":"Sharma","documentHash":"21ff6ede-9aa1-45f7-b94c-261f317287ac"},{"objectId":"676ea7cffdbe8322e23da873","name":"Ajay K.","lastName":"Gautam","documentHash":"9fd17782-778b-4dec-8c4f-a15fb39b0cf1"},{"objectId":"676ea7cffdbe8322e23da872","name":"Vedpriya","lastName":"Arya","documentHash":"03924ac5-e4ae-4578-8ac5-13a28597ec41"},{"objectId":"676ea7cffdbe8322e23da871","name":"Akansha","lastName":"Rohela","documentHash":"afa73b48-c5f1-44f5-bbdb-b366532305a4"},{"objectId":"676ea7cffdbe8322e23da870","name":"Ashwani","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"94437423-25b8-4323-8c15-69ec3322b0ba"},{"objectId":"676ea7cffdbe8322e23da86f","name":"Acharya","lastName":"Balkrishna","documentHash":"71d40d6b-1b33-4388-989d-6df3f13c6d5b"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"objectId":"676ea7cffdbe8322e23da86e","doi":"10.1093/jpp/rgae013","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85186746449&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Traditional uses, hepatoprotective potential, and phytopharmacology of Tinospora cordifolia: a narrative review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"OBJECTIVES: Despite significant advancements in modern medicine, effective hepatoprotective medication with minimal side effects is still lacking. In this context. Tinospora cordifolia, an Indian Ayurvedic liana, has attracted much attention. KEY FINDINGS: Traditionally, T. cordifolia has been found to be effective in the treatment of jaundice; according to the literature, T. cordifolia is a hepatoprotective agent, and the CCl4 model is the most frequently used to evaluate its potential. Its hepatoprotective effects might be attributed to alkaloids (berberine, palmatine, and jatrorrhizine) and sinapic acid. Berberine decreases inflammation by inhibiting the proinflammatory cascade triggered by TNF-α and reduces nitrosative stress by inhibiting iNOS. T. cordifolia also exhibits anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and other activities; it is safe at concentrations up to 2000 mg/kg. Its biological action can be attributed to polyphenols, alkaloids, steroids, terpenoids, and glycosides. T. cordifolia has also been found to be an active ingredient in several polyherbal formulations used to treat chemical-mediated hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSION: T. cordifolia’s hepatoprotective effects are mediated by the inhibition of lipid peroxidation, the management of oxidative stress, and other factors. T. cordifolia can be used to manage liver disorders and as a hepatoprotective supplement in the food industry. The bioprospecting of its alkaloids can lead to the development of novel formulations against hepatic ailments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"76","pagesFromTo":"183-200","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676ea7cffdbe8322e23da86f","676ea7cffdbe8322e23da870","676ea7cffdbe8322e23da871","676ea7cffdbe8322e23da872","676ea7cffdbe8322e23da873","676ea7cffdbe8322e23da874","676ea7cffdbe8322e23da875","676ea7cffdbe8322e23da876","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e731252467f01e9315f914","title":"Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology","issn":"2042-7158","documentHash":"a718f2e5-c731-4472-8265-d4d132bb950a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bioactive molecules","Guduchi","hepatoprotection","liver disorders","misidentification"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357401"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63589ba9752340623bc06a34","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Zając","uuid":"81C834303EC1C208CFBAFC2F0C09871CEC3C4F08740810A23A4BBEDF8EF06D96453538C5624F34B76D433EEBCEB7856BAB03D664B0BC9D69A0153C1F19B6EE5F","documentHash":"a1ce6b3d-2fa5-4955-8f17-eab40636fccb"},{"objectId":"6350b2a9752340623bbeb304","name":"Oliwia","lastName":"Serej","uuid":"D3E4C4DA40F7C7571091A5EEA338D8FC5DDC6D63C03A02DA9A2E6B0D02E00D379899D60E7DE1AB8CF1E9442AF372EEEA2E6F73C69BD697D5A89DE37DBD78095D","documentHash":"c6fd4b83-99c9-4a6a-b641-cf6d869bee53"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59e8","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":"FFF1C302A4ED581F77AA01D5950E55F14D23CDBCDAD59F843C36670289FB7C56D37700578F5282A4A9F572D9B626394E4F8E70F38AD1BE8043807EDC54FA76BB","documentHash":"e11b06a4-6f92-4cb7-b88c-c8e09d0b50ab"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5890","name":"Robert","lastName":"Rękawiecki","uuid":"628735F54B973B38689AFE229955AB0F8A033305183D099551DBE361D4E670C2FEA0B2B0BF144AEDB81E2F41180B9BA1D5C72D5A91760FC1147F2824FC2D01B7","documentHash":"89c90d91-e466-457a-9ea0-32b253ea76e3"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588f","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kowalik","uuid":"7A7C3A9F21F6AB89CF7A93BE9AFD84358C361AF1ED8C2FD983B77498398EB447F35B9C99B1AA1CBA0B31DD725219020B8BC567823865E988B3DAE715A8E589D5","orcidId":"0000-0001-7637-0911","documentHash":"bc59a033-f672-4d53-adfe-4d685d38e0cd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2023-08-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e821dfdbe8322e23c444b","doi":"10.3390/ani13172784","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85170282650&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Luteotropic and luteolytic factors modulate the expression of nuclear receptor coregulators in bovine luteal cells independently of histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase activities","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aims of this study were to examine the effect of luteotropic and luteolytic factors on the mRNA and protein expression of the coactivators HAT: histone acetyltransferase p300 (P300), cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB), and steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and the corepressor: nuclear receptor corepressor-2 (NCOR-2) in bovine luteal cells on days 6–10 and 16–20.

Therefore, it is possible that these factors, through changes in the expression of nuclear receptor coactivators and corepressors, may affect the functioning of the nuclear receptors, including PGRs, in the bovine CL. © 2023 by the authors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6350b2a9752340623bbeb304","63589ba9752340623bc06a34","5e709410878c28a0473b59e8","5e70940d878c28a0473b588f","5e70940d878c28a0473b5890"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art. no 2784 (1-16)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940d878c28a0473b5890","5e709410878c28a0473b59e8","63589ba9752340623bc06a34","6350b2a9752340623bbeb304","5e70940d878c28a0473b588f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["corpus luteum","cow","CREB","NCOR-2","P300","progesterone receptor coregulators","SRC-1"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357471"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","name":"Carsten","lastName":"Carlberg","uuid":"7A3E0E7963E1192270F3903EEFFAA1A086E27754D1B393FD104F68B8A691171F30A075FDFF073A66B06C35CCE685244FF4287E47226B5FB73CCE42A85608CA83","documentHash":"50649f30-9531-42e7-8c6c-543c2bbfecb8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676950b9fdbe8317b9a18b48","doi":"10.3390/nu15010171","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85145970208&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A pleiotropic nuclear hormone labelled hundred years ago vitamin D","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"art. no 171 (1-4)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","issn":"2072-6643","documentHash":"c19e39d9-34f9-43a7-9c35-a6b3e3ec2726"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060357476"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6777966cfdbe833ec1c7cad2","name":"Pegg","lastName":"Ronald","documentHash":"7c78a70a-39ff-409c-b007-bf5398dc760f"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"objectId":"6777966cfdbe833ec1c7cad1","doi":"10.1201/9781003265955-11","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Prooxidants and antioxidants in food","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"From the perspective of maximizing a food’s wholesomeness and shelf-life or of evaluating the potential health benefits afforded by consuming a foodstuff, one must possess knowledge about the types, quantities, and mechanistic action of the prooxidants and antioxidants in the product. Foods contain natural antioxidants and prooxidant constituents at various concentrations. Yet when food undergoes processing, prooxidant and antioxidant constituents can be stripped from, introduced to, or generated within the food system. This chapter describes some of the most common sources of natural antioxidants found in foods and reports on the mechanisms involved in lipid and protein oxidation, as well as the impact of these reactions on the sensory and biological properties of foods. The beneficial role of adding natural antioxidants and the types available are discussed in terms of not only how to combat the deleterious effects of oxidation, but also how concentration can play a part in turning an antioxidant into a prooxidant within a food system. The most common types of prooxidants are described and when known, their mechanistic action in a food system is presented. Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion of the in vitro assays available to assess the antioxidant potential of a foodstuff."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"chapter 11","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6777966cfdbe833ec1c7cad2","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"64ca4bc84097077ac1cf5650","title":"Chemical and Functional Properties of Food Components","year":2023,"isbn":"9781003265955","url":"https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003265955","translation":false,"documentHash":"5d95bd2a-d6a7-43b9-a93d-8e89156fb995","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7c9","mniswId":"20200","name":"CRC Press / Balkema","documentHash":"2a6ef8b6-bb62-46c9-82bd-63632e7f90e5"}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060357478"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e9496fdbe8322e23d09bd","name":"Frank","lastName":"Rosell","documentHash":"be47f94a-0d2b-4f0e-81ee-b7b5d3d79133"},{"objectId":"676e9496fdbe8322e23d09bc","name":"Christian A.","lastName":"Robstad","documentHash":"fe11459f-585f-4380-b131-4d9d665a596e"},{"objectId":"5e7094f6878c28a0473c8084","name":"Jumpei","lastName":"Tomiyasu","uuid":"6DE49D2F6EAC73459F52C6DFD0DCC0FFE0130EED57D382459D8BB991BA51EA5F9E6E57C6180F29BA7BF00B712DF28C873EA3A34FE58E7CC287EA9997686E6FD1","documentHash":"96609ea8-27fd-415d-a276-a6361c45e695"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af611","name":"Anna","lastName":"Korzekwa","uuid":"6CCA76174E9BF1DF35E4C1E90E2B3B9D78AF9BDADC1E212FB54879C770E920DAC45DD70A8F63FE965B8949684CD8F8490ACB631BBDD818E2C1FDBAC1061F4362","documentHash":"f996b0b0-de34-42e8-8338-b6cd4d848669"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e9496fdbe8322e23d09ba","doi":"10.1016/j.therwi.2023.100059","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Development of fetal Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mammals are categorized along an altricial-precocial spectrum based on degrees of neonatal development. Altricial neonates are immature at birth and dependent on care, whereas precocial neonates are relatively well developed and independent post-partum. The Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) is a large, semiaquatic, relatively precocial mammal in the order Rodentia. However, the extended care of kits in burrows begs the question of why beavers have precocial characteristics. A study of fetal development might enable understanding of the traits that are significant for neonatal survival. The present study examined external morphological characteristics, external biometry and the development of internal organs in 80 Eurasian beaver fetuses (crown-rump length [CRL], 2.5–19.3 cm) derived from 33 wild pregnant females hunted in Norway (33 gestational age). We also created equations to predict fetal ages from biometric parameters based on a linear relationship between biometric parameters and fetal ages estimated from fetal weight. Fetal features appeared in the following chronological order; eyelid bulbs and tactile hairs (CRL ≥ 7.3 cm), outer ears, claws, skin differentiation (CRL ≥ 8.9 cm), and hair coverage and tooth eruption (CRL ≥ 9.4 cm). All biometric parameters increased linearly and positively as the CRL increased and did not tend to stabilize. Notably, slopes of hindfoot parameters were higher than those of forefeet, suggesting that the hindfeet of beavers grow faster than forefeet, as they do in other semi-aquatic mammals. Our calculations revealed that dorsal length, CRL, thoracic and abdominal circumferences were candidate predictors of fetal age due to a high coefficient of determination (≥ 0.95) and broad range (≥ 10 cm). Our findings revealed that beaver growth was precocial in terms of differentiated skin, hair coverage, and tooth eruption, but not fully completed, as none of the fetuses had open eyes. The rapid growth of the hindfoot and some precocial traits (skin and hair differentiation) may be involved with the ability of neonatal beavers to move in water."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f6878c28a0473c8084","5e7093b2878c28a0473af611"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"3","pagesFromTo":"art. no 100059 (1-7)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094f6878c28a0473c8084","676e9496fdbe8322e23d09bc","5e7093b2878c28a0473af611","676e9496fdbe8322e23d09bd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"676e9496fdbe8322e23d09bb","title":"Theriogenology Wild","issn":"2773-093X","websiteLink":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/theriogenology-wild","documentHash":"8d0992c3-50d2-41fd-bf47-4bc8153e38c9"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Developmental biology","Precocial rodent","Aquatic adaptation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357479"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e4bdcfdbe8322e23b8f3a","name":"Nataliia","lastName":"Hryhorenko","documentHash":"a74087e1-db99-4d1f-a4fc-97427d090f29"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c120c","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Bączek","uuid":"637E16C1658EDFF062FD7C045372ED2816EBDD7665FA8106FA0D3290461451C92D6BF340D799162F07D2D9C19F7C79E2F27CD587C62DA06813892B0301C39A2D","documentHash":"aa402877-5138-43d9-970c-b4d98ce24fe0"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11ff","name":"Bogumiła","lastName":"Rudnicka","uuid":"E7C844EAA54581C7972CB16CA216884EE267FF2FB7834C4DCD6F5678E883E3C7B3D1C5571A1FC160DCAD17E2701816EF27F06ED95D26706142F5F42D2362F7A8","documentHash":"1e1eb8d1-1028-43b7-adc7-0b7b45551420"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5aef","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Wróblewska","uuid":"5DB03D00276FB168A632F58946904D68371579A788199D21A9EF92ED0D66A6CE10D4942D9186141FE9863E443F60CBF7B7368A38845839154002943427732A15","documentHash":"56465ee4-d650-4e09-bfd2-a0d6e9de84a5"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b590c","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Krupa-Kozak","uuid":"824046190EE24412796A8810E9411D9CE05BF23BC9D270DAA5BCB208C989366F8E808ACA30C1F7DF5E6D86B3E899878705B2F6E7827CB1232D8102AD21736584","documentHash":"5eb3692a-f31e-4173-b6e9-435b4fba6984"}],"objectId":"676e4bdcfdbe8322e23b8f39","doi":"10.1016/j.jcs.2023.103646","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85147373721&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Gluten-free bread enriched with whole-grain red sorghum flour gains favourable technological and functional properties and consumers acceptance","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Sorghum is a gluten-free nutrient-dense minor cereal, rich in polyphenols and bioactive compounds of presumed functional and health benefits.

Despite its recognized pharmacological benefits, its potential application in the food industry remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate the proximate analysis and techno-functional properties of Berberis aristata root powder to evaluate its feasibility as a functional food ingredient. The root powder of Berberis aristata was subjected to proximate analysis to determine its moisture, ash, protein, fat, fiber, and carbohydrate content. Techno-functional properties, including water and oil absorption capacity, emulsifying and foaming properties, and bulk density, were evaluated using standardized analytical techniques. The proximate analysis revealed a high fiber content and a significant number of bioactive compounds. The root powder exhibited favorable water and oil absorption capacities, making it suitable for use as a thickening and stabilizing agent. Emulsifying and foaming properties were comparable to conventional food additives, indicating their potential in various food formulations.

Hereby, we assessed BPA action on human primary granulosa (hGC) and mouse Leydig cells (BLTK-1) proliferation, cytotoxicity, hormone secretion, and steroidogenic enzyme/receptor gene profile. hGC and BLTK-1 cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of BPA (10-12 M to 10-4 M for cell proliferation assay, 10-8 M to 10-4 M for LDH-cytotoxicity assay, and 10-9 M to 10-5 M for hormone secretion and genes expression analysis). BPA at low concentrations (pM – nM) did not affect cell proliferation in either cell type, although was toxic at higher (µM) concentrations. BPA stimulation at low nM concentrations decreased the production of estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) in BLTK-1, E2, and progesterone in hGCs. BPA down-regulated Star, Cyp11a1, and Hsd17b3, but up-regulated Cyp19a1, Esr1, Esr2, and Gpr30 expression in BLTK-1 cells. In hGC, BPA down-regulated STAR, CYP19A1, PGRMC1, and PAQR7 but up-regulated ESR2 expression. Estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant (FULV) attenuated BPA inhibition of hormone production in both cell lines. FULV also blocked the BPA-induced Gpr30 up-regulation in BLTK-1 cells, whereas in hGC, failed to reverse the down-regulation of PGRMC1, STAR, and CYP19A1. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into environmentally-relevant doses of BPA action through both nuclear estrogen receptor-dependent and independent mechanisms affecting cultured granulosa and Leydig cell steroidogenesis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["676e737afdbe8322e23bfcf9","5e709375878c28a0473aa22d","5e7092ac878c28a04739a659","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7","5e70922d878c28a04739129c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"art. no 100766 (1-12)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a659","676e737afdbe8322e23bfcf5","676e737afdbe8322e23bfcf6","676e737afdbe8322e23bfcf7","676e737afdbe8322e23bfcf8","676e737afdbe8322e23bfcf9","5e70922d878c28a04739129c","676e737afdbe8322e23bfcfa","676e737afdbe8322e23bfcfb","676e737afdbe8322e23bfcfc","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7","676e737afdbe8322e23bfcfd","5e709375878c28a0473aa22d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e722042467f01e93054c9c","title":"Reproductive Biology","issn":"1477-7827","documentHash":"fe097ffb-75b8-4aa8-82e6-0d6de3529780"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bisphenol A","Gonadal somatic cells","Steroidogenesis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357515"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e632dfdbe8322e23bbbbc","name":"Rina","lastName":"Meiden","documentHash":"a9b1db50-8445-49a8-b215-ff1e42e0f920"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db92","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":"B098C0A528257742FE7260630F778D12964C7B5C6227723C0B82DB42874A1368CF6017A4E9CA6B7F39C9E84245C06E67EF1E4D8E3489D40F22A3D57CCE9F1BE1","documentHash":"71a82dd5-3af9-42bb-bfe3-be6e20ae2dfa"}],"objectId":"676e632dfdbe8322e23bbbbb","doi":"10.1093/biolre/ioad026","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85159735424&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Divergent roles of sirtuin 1 in human granulosa-lutein cells: similarities to human chorionic gonadotropin","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is an NAD+ dependent deacetylase that modifies gene expression through histone deacetylation. It also deacetylates non-histone substrates, e.g. tumor suppressor p53, NOS3, HIF1A, NFKB, FOXO3a, PGC-1α, and PPARγ. Consequently, it regulates a wide range of physiological functions including cell cycle control, energy expenditure, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, and aging. SIRT1 is expressed in ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) of various species including humans at different stages of the reproductive cycle. The importance of SIRT1 in female reproduction is supported by the findings that SIRT1-knockout mice exhibit defects in reproductive tissue development. These mice were found to have a thin-walled uterus, small ovaries, with follicles present but no corpora lutea. This review aims to provide state-of-the-art information on SIRT1’s mode of action and its roles in human granulosa-lutein cells and GCs from other species where data is available.

We presently investigated the role of impaired leptin signalling on transcriptional regulation in granulosa cells (GCs) collected from genetically obese mice. Furthermore, we characterised the association between ovarian leptin signalling, the activation of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and macrophage infiltration in obese mice. After phenotype characterisation, ovaries were collected from distinct group of animals for protein and mRNA expression analysis: (i) mice subjected to a diet-induced obesity (DIO) protocol, where one group was fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and another a standard chow diet (CD) for durations of 4 or 16 weeks; (ii) mice genetically deficient in the long isoform of the leptin receptor (ObRb; db/db); (iii) mice genetically deficient in leptin (ob/ob); and (iv) mice rendered pharmacologically hyperleptinemic (LEPT). Next, GCs from antral follicles isolated from db/db and ob/ob mice were subjected to transcriptome analysis. Transcriptional analysis revealed opposing profiles in genes associated with steroidogenesis and prostaglandin action between the genetic models, despite the similarities in body weight. Furthermore, we observed no changes in the mRNA and protein levels of NLRP3 inflammasome components in the ovaries of db/db mice or in markers of M1 and M2 macrophage infiltration. This contrasted with the downregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome components and M1 markers in ob/ob and 16-wk HFD-fed mice. We concluded that leptin signalling regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the expression of M1 markers in the ovaries of obese mice in an ObRb-dependent and ObRb-independent manner. Furthermore, we found no changes in the expression of leptin signalling and NLRP3 inflammasome genes in GCs from db/db and ob/ob mice, which was associated with no effects on macrophage infiltration genes, despite the dysregulation of genes associated with steroidogenesis in homozygous obese db/db. Our results suggest that: (i) the crosstalk between leptin signalling, NLRP3 inflammasome and macrophage infiltration takes place in ovarian components other than the GC compartment; and (ii) transcriptional changes in GCs from homozygous obese ob/ob mice suggest structural rearrangement and organisation, whereas in db/db mice the impairment in steroidogenesis and secretory activity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d6878c28a04739db87","5e709389878c28a0473ac2ed","5e70947f878c28a0473be651","61d510b87523401fc110f971","5e7092d6878c28a04739db93"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"art. no 8070 (1-17)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d6878c28a04739db93","61d510b87523401fc110f971","5e7092d6878c28a04739db87","5e709389878c28a0473ac2ed","676ea37efdbe8322e23d921e","5e70947f878c28a0473be651"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e72c172467f01e931097bc","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"1053-8100","documentHash":"46b51ef7-40cf-4a0a-bec7-7c4781b52d4e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Leptin","Obesity","Ovary","Macrophage","NLRP3 infammasome"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357523"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":"4C887615D8CF2C7AED96BBBF9BA5C5F08ED58C03893B40229F8B7BC60591947D230EB5884E4543FA7A07891B19A3B7714641EF4DB0922B7E97E35D4B3AAB996B","documentHash":"b2431fda-02ea-4ffb-9f2a-57ed6c3ab5d1"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a82d7","name":"Maria","lastName":"Guzewska","uuid":"0331AD1CF20FB8E16484AD4B8BB8990157C27ADE20D3C2FF54E14B0009ADCFC57AC311BA0F88A6863C3DA0EE012A2B6C858346F4B207B759016275B2164115F4","documentHash":"5b96efe6-ccd8-4a86-adfa-27faa0a4385c"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbbb","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szuszkiewicz","uuid":"B3C96698E29462BF1C5A76532D81BE3E9DC8036C9E04D0956E04E82B221A1A26F6B1C1F1C4D3A3E47C0920C520572C363D5BCBB48E555EBF9346B7C2CB768FEC","documentHash":"06dee320-66e2-49d6-b2fb-510e5e733749"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e49bffdbe8322e23b8db3","doi":"10.1002/mrd.23664","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85146330057&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Extracellular vesicles: Focus on peri-implantation period of pregnancy in pigs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The establishment of cell-to-cell communication between the endometrium and the developing embryo is the most important step in successful mammalian pregnancy.

However, few studies have focused on revealing the mechanism of EV-mediated crosstalk between developing early embryos and receptive endometrium. Over the past years, it has appeared that understanding the role of EVs in mammalian reproduction can substantially improve our understanding of the biological challenges of successful reproductive performance. This review describes current knowledge of EVs, specifically in relation to the peri-implantation period in pigs, characterized by common features of embryo implantation and high embryonic mortality in mammals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d6878c28a04739dbbb","5e70935e878c28a0473a82d7","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"90","pagesFromTo":"634-645","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70935e878c28a0473a82d7","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbbb","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f0b","mniswId":"14577","title":"MOLECULAR REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT","issn":"1040-452X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"8c45eb76-57e7-4b31-a83f-0fee4d8c88e9"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cell‐cell communication","embryo","endometrium","extracellular vesicles","implantation","pregnancy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357560"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e87d2fdbe8322e23c71ca","name":"Abdel H.","lastName":"Harrath","documentHash":"7942022b-3efd-402a-88a5-02a6caa04f0e"},{"objectId":"676e87d2fdbe8322e23c71c9","name":"Sona","lastName":"Nitrayova","documentHash":"3cf8a0e3-855e-4085-a69f-767c041b81d9"},{"objectId":"676e87d2fdbe8322e23c71c8","name":"Saleh","lastName":"Alwasel","documentHash":"6b2b4c48-8cc1-4422-a19c-0ade97800318"},{"objectId":"676e87d2fdbe8322e23c71c7","name":"Milos","lastName":"Mlyncek","documentHash":"8a7311de-306e-4615-b874-6dc8ef29368b"},{"objectId":"676e87d2fdbe8322e23c71c6","name":"Adam","lastName":"Tarko","documentHash":"1f49bd60-f0eb-4789-bcff-9fb3618d1019"},{"objectId":"676e87d2fdbe8322e23c71c5","name":"Alexander V.","lastName":"Sirotkin","documentHash":"eaeb3f57-402a-443a-8c89-a1ee319de203"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c28","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kotwica","uuid":"385A852C4444CB9E0834360EA9CB5447DAA8769BC4824DF6157291803425A6E6379F07FED1C99EFB7D5F465E5A6BE9848257FE25794C37B2D7DB4C3937D900CE","documentHash":"3d7a4dfa-c22d-4959-9a2f-2a1c9f18e44c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e87d2fdbe8322e23c71c4","doi":"10.33549/physiolres.934986","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85158080345&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Three medicinal plants affecting human ovarian cell viability, hormone release, and response to environmental contaminant toluene","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present study examined the effect of medicinal plants - ginkgo, tribulus (puncture vine ), and yucca - on ovarian functions and their response to the toxic influence of toluene.

The adipose tissue circadian clock may be associated with the regulation of insulin action; however, human data are limited. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of subcutaneous adipose tissue circadian genes as they relate to obesity and insulin sensitivity before and after diet-induced weight loss. Methods: The study group comprised 38 individuals who were overweight or obese. The individuals completed a 12-wk dietary intervention program. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy were performed before and after the program. Sixteen normal weight individuals were examined at baseline and served as a control group. Results: At baseline, individuals who were overweight/obese had lower adipose tissue expression of NR1D1, NR1D2, DBP, PER1, and PER2 than normal weight individuals. The expression of ARNTL, CLOCK, and CRY did not differ between the groups. A weight-reducing dietary intervention resulted in an increase in the expression of adipose tissue NR1D2 and DBP, which was positively related to insulin sensitivity both before (in the entire study group and in the subgroup of overweight/obese individuals) and after the dietary intervention. Conclusions: Adipose tissue circadian gene expression is decreased in obesity and this decrease may be partially reversed by dietary intervention. Among circadian genes, NR1D2 and DBP seem to be specifically associated with insulin action. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947f878c28a0473be65e","5e709377878c28a0473aa543"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"115","pagesFromTo":"art. no 112153 (1-6)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709377878c28a0473aa543","676e8973fdbe8322e23c7e55","5e70947f878c28a0473be65e","676e8973fdbe8322e23c7e56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a3","mniswId":"15296","title":"Nutrition","issn":"0899-9007","documentHash":"aba0da59-a04c-4c8c-b9cc-b17c7d3ad858"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Adipose tissue","Circadian clock","Dietary intervention","Insulin sensitivity","Obesity","Weight loss"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357595"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","name":"Carsten","lastName":"Carlberg","uuid":"7A3E0E7963E1192270F3903EEFFAA1A086E27754D1B393FD104F68B8A691171F30A075FDFF073A66B06C35CCE685244FF4287E47226B5FB73CCE42A85608CA83","documentHash":"50649f30-9531-42e7-8c6c-543c2bbfecb8"},{"objectId":"5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c0e","name":"Julia","lastName":"Jarosławska-Miszkiewicz","uuid":"18C41BF13C62E3811D508951BA29C0BF46C71F2F3ED332E67E03A98C40B6C43613B3BDF890E63EE19A740E970B0563C6EE7706FB19448F4E3CF03587B3EA0A6A","documentHash":"3aed2fd6-2183-47df-94d4-d3949c65ecd1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e4e55fdbe8322e23b9111","doi":"10.3390/ijms241914632","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85174688142&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"In vivo regulation of signal transduction pathways by vitamin D stabilizes homeostasis of human immune cells and counteracts molecular stress","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Vitamin D3 is a pre-hormone that regulates hundreds of target genes and dozens of physiological functions, including calcium homeostasis and the activity of the immune system, via its metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which is a high-affinity ligand for the transcription factor vitamin D receptor. In this study, we took advantage of data from the VitDHiD vitamin D3 intervention trial (25 healthy individuals) indicating that 442 protein-coding genes were significantly (false discovery rate &lt; 0.05) up- or downregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells one day after taking a vitamin D3 bolus. Since more than half of the encoded proteins had “signaling” assigned as a primary biological function, we evaluated their involvement in signal transduction cascades included in the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database and found 88 of the vitamin D targets contributing to 16 different pathways. Eight of the pathways show an approximately even contribution of up- and downregulated genes, suggesting that the actions of vitamin D stabilize homeostasis of the physiological processes driven by the respective signaling cascades. Interestingly, vitamin D target genes involved in the signaling pathways of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) are primarily downregulated. This supports the observation that the physiological role of vitamin D in healthy individuals is to tone down certain processes rather than activate them. In conclusion, under in vivo conditions, vitamin D either alleviates the homeostasis of immune cells in healthy individuals or counteracts molecular responses to oxygen deprivation (HIF1), microbe infection (TNF), growth stimulation (MAPKs) and inflammation (NFκB). © 2023 by the authors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c0e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"art. no 14632 (1-10)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c0e","6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff3a4ad49b31ccec0afc1","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1661-6596","documentHash":"b3f80bff-4f92-4717-ba64-03a3ee02790b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["HIF1","immune cells","MAPK","NFκB","signal transduction","TNF","vitamin D","vitamin D target genes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357621"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e5b2bfdbe8322e23ba7f1","name":"Lars-Oliver","lastName":"Klotz","documentHash":"ea09da36-417d-4ace-8669-6eb8d6434432"},{"objectId":"6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","name":"Carsten","lastName":"Carlberg","uuid":"7A3E0E7963E1192270F3903EEFFAA1A086E27754D1B393FD104F68B8A691171F30A075FDFF073A66B06C35CCE685244FF4287E47226B5FB73CCE42A85608CA83","documentHash":"50649f30-9531-42e7-8c6c-543c2bbfecb8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-10-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e5b2bfdbe8322e23ba7f0","doi":"10.1016/j.redox.2023.102920","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85174055618&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Nutrigenomics and redox regulation: Concepts relating to the Special Issue on nutrigenomics","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"During our whole lifespan, from conception to death, the epigenomes of all tissues and cell types of our body integrate signals from the environment. This includes signals derived from our diet and the uptake of macro- and micronutrients. In most cases, this leads only to transient changes, but some effects of this epigenome programming process are persistent and can even be transferred to the next generation. Both epigenetic programming and redox processes are affected by the individual choice of diet and other lifestyle decisions like physical activity. The nutrient-gene communication pathways have adapted during human evolution and are essential for maintaining health. However, when they are maladaptive, such as in long-term obesity, they significantly contribute to diseases like type 2 diabetes and cancer. The field of nutrigenomics investigates nutrition-related signal transduction pathways and their effect on gene expression involving interactions both with the genome and the epigenomes. Several of these diet-(epi)genome interactions and the involved signal transduction cascades are redox-regulated. Examples include the effects of the NAD+/NADH ratio, vitamin C levels and secondary metabolites of dietary molecules from plants on the acetylation and methylation state of the epigenome as well as on gene expression through redox-sensitive pathways via the transcription factors NFE2L2 and FOXO.

Clinically, we found that miR-96-5p significantly decreased in serum, follicular fluid (FF) and primary human granulosa cells (hGCs) of PCOS patients (n=70) vs. non-PCOS women (n=60), as well as in the ovaries of 3-types of induced PCOS-like mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the elevated circulating miR-96-5p levels were significantly correlated with the PCOS disordered endocrine clinical features, and the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic was 0.8344, with 75.71% specificity and 80% sensitivity. Mechanically, we identified miR-96-5p as an androgen-regulated miRNA that directly targets the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1. Inhibition of miR-96-5p decreased estrogen synthesis, while decreasing the cell proliferation index of KGN via regulating the expression of FOXO1 and its downstream genes. Inversely, inhibition of FOXO1 abrogated the effect of miR-96-5p on estrogen synthesis and proliferation index. Of note, ovarian intra-bursal injection of miR-96-5p agomir rescued the phenotypes of dehydroepiandrosterone-induced PCOS like mice. In conclusion, our results clarified a vital role of miR-96-5p in the pathogenesis of PCOS and might serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PCOS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"256","pagesFromTo":"1-13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676e5e43fdbe8322e23bb1d8","676e5e43fdbe8322e23bb1d9","676e5e43fdbe8322e23bb1da","676e5e43fdbe8322e23bb1db","676e5e43fdbe8322e23bb1dc","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7","676e5e43fdbe8322e23bb1dd","676e5e43fdbe8322e23bb1de","676e5e43fdbe8322e23bb1df","676e5e43fdbe8322e23bb1e0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454799a6","mniswId":"19710","title":"Translational Research","issn":"1931-5244","eissn":"1878-1810","documentHash":"d28c251f-1454-48e5-8bde-83163ff9d451"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Polycystic ovary syndrome","miR-96-5p","forkhead transcription factor FOXO1","biomarker","molecular therapy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357642"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e928dfdbe8322e23cf199","name":"Alexander V.","lastName":"Sirotkin","documentHash":"8540f4e4-4cc9-4578-8a0e-858921734787"},{"objectId":"676e928dfdbe8322e23cf198","name":"Andrej","lastName":"Baláži","documentHash":"a03585b4-9c22-4952-81b4-65cb7185dea3"},{"objectId":"676e928dfdbe8322e23cf197","name":"Abdel H.","lastName":"Harrath","documentHash":"76e88905-5ef8-4292-a886-5fd0d86cda6a"},{"objectId":"676e928dfdbe8322e23cf196","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Štochmaľová","documentHash":"e1553c60-af5a-4bfe-bbb5-1332c776b211"},{"objectId":"676e928dfdbe8322e23cf195","name":"Adam","lastName":"Tarko","documentHash":"1b1fa8ea-85c5-400a-bbb8-6869bac70a8b"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c28","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kotwica","uuid":"385A852C4444CB9E0834360EA9CB5447DAA8769BC4824DF6157291803425A6E6379F07FED1C99EFB7D5F465E5A6BE9848257FE25794C37B2D7DB4C3937D900CE","documentHash":"3d7a4dfa-c22d-4959-9a2f-2a1c9f18e44c"}],"objectId":"676e928dfdbe8322e23cf194","doi":"10.1016/j.rvsc.2022.12.005","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85145188289&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Quercetin can affect porcine ovarian cell functions and to mitigate some of the effects of the environmental contaminant toluene","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present in vitro experiments aimed to examine the effects of the plant polyphenol quercetin and the environmental contaminant toluene on basic ovarian cell functions, including the ability of quercetin to be a natural protector against the adverse effects of toluene.

Toluene stimulated cell proliferation and inhibited progesterone, IGF-I and testosterone release but did not affect apoptosis. Quercetin, when administered alone, inhibited cell proliferation, apoptosis, IGF-I and testosterone release and stimulated progesterone output. When administered in combination with toluene, quercetin mitigated toluene's effects on proliferation and on progesterone release and induced toluene to exhibit a pro-apoptotic effect. These observations demonstrate the direct effects of both quercetin and toluene on basic ovarian functions and a protective effect of quercetin against the effects of toluene.

Despite being considered to affect up to one-fifth of women in this cohort, the condition lacks generally accepted diagnostic biomarkers and options for targeted therapy. Hereby, we analyzed the diagnostic, therapeutic, and functional potential of a recently discovered miR-335-5p that was observed to be reduced in the follicular fluid (FF) of PCOS patients as compared with healthy women. We found miR-335-5p to be significantly decreased in the serum and FF samples of PCOS patients (n=40) vs. healthy women (n=30), as well as in primary human granulosa cells (hGCs), and in 3 different hormonally induced PCOS-like murine models vs. wild-type (WT) mice. The level of circulating miR-335-5p was found to significantly correlate with the impaired endocrine and clinical features associated with PCOS in human patients. Ovarian intrabursal injection of the miR-335-5p antagomir in WT mice ovaries induced a PCOS-like reproductive phenotype. Treatment with the miR-335-5p agomir rescued the dihydrotestosterone-induced PCOS-phenotype in mice, thereby providing a functional link between miR-335-5p and PCOS. We identified SP1 as a miR-335-5p target gene by using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Both the luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that SP1 bound to the promoter region of human CYP19A1 and inhibited its transcription. miR-335-5p increased the production of estradiol via the SP1/CYP19A1 axis in hGCs, thereby suggesting its mechanistic pathway of action. In conclusion, these results provide evidence that miR-335-5p may function as a mediator in the etiopathogenesis of PCOS, as well as has the potential as both a novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PCOS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"252","pagesFromTo":"64-78","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676ea15bfdbe8322e23d89cb","676ea15bfdbe8322e23d89cc","676ea15bfdbe8322e23d89cd","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7","676ea15bfdbe8322e23d89ce","676ea15bfdbe8322e23d89cf","676ea15bfdbe8322e23d89d0","676ea15bfdbe8322e23d89d1","676ea15bfdbe8322e23d89d2","676ea15bfdbe8322e23d89d3","676ea15bfdbe8322e23d89d4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454799a6","mniswId":"19710","title":"Translational Research","issn":"1931-5244","eissn":"1878-1810","documentHash":"d28c251f-1454-48e5-8bde-83163ff9d451"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["miR-335-5p","polycystic ovary syndrome","estradiol","biomarker","molecular therapy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357652"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e80cafdbe8322e23c3be6","name":"Monica","lastName":"Butnariu","documentHash":"3ad1d504-768f-460e-ab8f-be37840d8b22"},{"objectId":"676e80cafdbe8322e23c3be5","name":"Javad","lastName":"Sharifi‐Rad","documentHash":"419436b8-af81-4989-b48e-796cbde82885"},{"objectId":"676e80cafdbe8322e23c3be4","name":"Manoj","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"72405da7-cc55-4eba-b6e4-def32ec2e483"},{"objectId":"676e80cafdbe8322e23c3be3","name":"Shabnum","lastName":"Shaheen","documentHash":"a95818d0-9998-49ea-920f-882edc3af53a"},{"objectId":"676e80cafdbe8322e23c3be2","name":"Gerardo","lastName":"Leyva‐Gómez","documentHash":"df2ce312-478b-48ec-bdb8-3580b081036e"},{"objectId":"676e80cafdbe8322e23c3be1","name":"Hamda","lastName":"Shafique","documentHash":"a836cc91-4bd9-400c-b7a8-c52db9077a5e"},{"objectId":"676e80cafdbe8322e23c3be0","name":"Mehwish","lastName":"Iqbal","documentHash":"97ae36ef-792f-44ce-b678-e49d51059c0e"},{"objectId":"676e80cafdbe8322e23c3bdf","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Akram","documentHash":"498c259b-6d61-4182-b7d4-6f975f834bb5"},{"objectId":"676e80cafdbe8322e23c3bde","name":"Ali Mahoumd","lastName":"Muddathir","documentHash":"2ec01072-865e-4cce-81a2-75b48e4d3382"},{"objectId":"676e80cafdbe8322e23c3bdd","name":"Ebtihal A.

Their plant parts have been used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring seasoning for cooking but, and as biopesticides with natural compounds. Myristicin has been related with several biological effects, such as anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, analgesic, and hepatoprotective. The traditional uses include the treatment of complications related to gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, and gynecological disorders. However, several studies have been reported contraindications associated to high dose consumption of myristicin. This review summarizes the biological activities of myristicin and myristicin-rich plants, toxicological effects along with its bioavailability, and metabolism. In addition, their traditional uses and their role as ecological remedy in plants protection has been reviewed. Nutmeg is the myristicin-rich plant with more pharmacological effects reported but also with most contraindication and toxically reports."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"4","pagesFromTo":"art. no e90 (1-14)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676e80cafdbe8322e23c3bd8","676e80cafdbe8322e23c3bd9","676e80cafdbe8322e23c3bda","676e80cafdbe8322e23c3bdb","676e80cafdbe8322e23c3bdc","676e80cafdbe8322e23c3bdd","676e80cafdbe8322e23c3bde","676e80cafdbe8322e23c3bdf","676e80cafdbe8322e23c3be0","676e80cafdbe8322e23c3be1","676e80cafdbe8322e23c3be2","676e80cafdbe8322e23c3be3","676e80cafdbe8322e23c3be4","676e80cafdbe8322e23c3be5","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","676e80cafdbe8322e23c3be6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61cc452f2467f06e5d47734d","title":"eFood","issn":"","eissn":"2666-3066","websiteLink":"https://www.atlantis-press.com/journals/efood","metadataSource":"USER","documentHash":"bd17a4b1-b71d-4773-8e1e-027768122dcb"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["green ecology","myristicin","nutmeg","parsley","phytotherapy","toxicity","traditional medicine"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357669"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67725c84fdbe831015c50677","name":"Gian C.","lastName":"Tenore","documentHash":"8ef97402-80b7-4bd2-9575-274304fe3af0"},{"objectId":"67725c84fdbe831015c50676","name":"Viviana","lastName":"Narciso","documentHash":"54094eb5-75d4-4ff4-9dea-701523877411"},{"objectId":"67725c84fdbe831015c50675","name":"Connie","lastName":"Schisano","documentHash":"24aeb041-78dc-489b-b69b-b85c722fdf7b"},{"objectId":"67725c84fdbe831015c50674","name":"Meriem","lastName":"Amrane-Abider","documentHash":"02749acb-a4c0-468c-a893-453f1369c7f7"},{"objectId":"67725c84fdbe831015c50673","name":"Mostapha","lastName":"Bachir-Bey","documentHash":"d164ec22-182a-4453-a7c0-b5d30cf73a7e"},{"objectId":"67725c84fdbe831015c50672","name":"Fatiha","lastName":"Benkerrou","documentHash":"59996938-6d19-4cf4-a3b8-fbc2e12285c0"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67725c84fdbe831015c50671","doi":"10.35219/foodtechnology.2024.1.09","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Bioactive compounds and pharmacological properties of some date cultivars (Phoenix dactylifera L.)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, five Algerian date cultivars (Phoenix dactylifera L.) were investigated for their antioxidant contents, phenolic profiles, and some pharmacological properties (anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and antioxidant activities).

The specific expression of genes shapes the phenotype of cells and tissues. The regulation of gene expression, including up- and downregulation, is a fundamental aspect of nearly all physiological processes, both in health and disease. These dynamic processes respond to various daily challenges, such as dietary changes and infections. Therefore, it is crucial for not only biologists and biochemists but also all students in biomedical disciplines to understand gene regulation concepts. This foundational knowledge will benefit them in their specialized fields. A comprehensive understanding of transcription factors and the mechanisms that alter their activity is a fundamental goal of modern life science research. Epigenetics refers to the packaging and accessibility of the genome in each of the trillions of cells in our bodies. The prefix “epi” (meaning “upon,” “above,” or “beyond”) indicates that epigenetic processes do not alter the DNA sequence of our genome, adding a layer of information beyond that encoded in our genome. Genomic DNA is wrapped around complexes of histone proteins, helping it fit into a cell nucleus with a diameter of less than 10 μm. This protein-DNA complex is known as chromatin. The content of this book is linked to the “Molecular Medicine and Genetics” course, which the author has lectured on in various forms since 2002 at the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio. This book is an updated version of the textbooks “Mechanisms of Gene Regulation” and “Human Epigenomics.” It is divided into 16 chapters. Following two introductory chapters, four chapters explore gene regulation from the perspective of transcription factors, while another four chapters focus on chromatin and non-coding RNA. Three chapters then discuss the impact of epigenetics from a health perspective, and the final three chapters address epigenetics from the perspective of diseases. A glossary in the appendix explains the major specialist terms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"978-3-031-68729-7","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"6480151740970709bf26fc49","name":"Springer Cham","documentHash":"b48a3812-e938-4af6-a021-29c0087ca09d"},"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Transcription factors","Chromatin","Cancer Epigenomics","Nutritional Epigenetics","RNA","DNA","Molecular Medicine","Immunology","Aging","Nutrition"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357742"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e86a3fdbe8322e23c68ee","name":"Abdel H.","lastName":"Harrath","documentHash":"e1ace471-25f5-454a-a7d9-30c7aa7616d7"},{"objectId":"676e86a3fdbe8322e23c68ed","name":"Saleh","lastName":"Alwasel","documentHash":"0d950f3c-0ea3-4c38-9ba8-62a199db1946"},{"objectId":"676e86a3fdbe8322e23c68ec","name":"Zuzana","lastName":"Fabova","documentHash":"898f224f-1b67-4ffb-b45e-acefda4b5963"},{"objectId":"676e86a3fdbe8322e23c68eb","name":"Adam","lastName":"Tarko","documentHash":"62d49f75-674d-436b-9fdd-379088d3e227"},{"objectId":"676e86a3fdbe8322e23c68ea","name":"Martina","lastName":"Macejková","documentHash":"a1e90fb7-9e6f-4dfd-85dd-14022e63621c"},{"objectId":"676e86a3fdbe8322e23c68e9","name":"Alexander","lastName":"Sirotkin","documentHash":"41c476e7-9675-4469-acb2-351524ae4d10"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c28","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kotwica","uuid":"385A852C4444CB9E0834360EA9CB5447DAA8769BC4824DF6157291803425A6E6379F07FED1C99EFB7D5F465E5A6BE9848257FE25794C37B2D7DB4C3937D900CE","documentHash":"3d7a4dfa-c22d-4959-9a2f-2a1c9f18e44c"}],"objectId":"676e86a3fdbe8322e23c68e8","doi":"10.1016/j.repbio.2023.100736","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85147884243&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Ginkgo, fennel, and flaxseed can affect hormone release by porcine ovarian cells and modulate the effect of toluene","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Experimental studies have documented the toxic effects of toluene on the mammalian female reproductive processes. The aim of this in vitro study was to examine the potential of functional food plant extracts, namely, of ginkgo, fennel, and flaxseed, in modifying the toluene-induced effects on ovarian hormone release. Porcine granulosa cells were incubated with ginkgo, fennel, or flaxseed extracts (0, 1, 10, or 100 µg/mL) and/or toluene (10 µg/mL). Enzyme immunoassays were used in order to measure the release of progesterone (P), oxytocin (OT), and prostaglandin F (PGF) in the culture media. Toluene suppressed the release of P and enhanced the release of OT and PGF. All tested plant extracts reduced P and increased OT release, while the PGF output was found inhibited by ginkgo and stimulated by fennel and flaxseed. When the cells were incubated with toluene and each one of the plant extracts, toluene was able to prevent their action on P release, as well as those of fennel and flaxseed on OT and PGF release. Moreover, ginkgo enhanced but fennel or flaxseed prevented the toluene-induced effects on OT and PGF release. These observations (i) document novel aspects of the toluene-induced toxicity; (ii) demonstrate the direct influence of ginkgo, fennel, and flaxseed extracts on the ovarian secretory activity; (iii) inform our understanding of the interrelationship between toluene and the tested plant extracts with regard to their effects on ovarian hormone release; (iiii) demonstrate the ability of fennel and flaxseed to prevent adverse effect of toluene on ovarian hormones."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"art. no 100736 (1-6)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676e86a3fdbe8322e23c68e9","676e86a3fdbe8322e23c68ea","676e86a3fdbe8322e23c68eb","676e86a3fdbe8322e23c68ec","676e86a3fdbe8322e23c68ed","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c28","676e86a3fdbe8322e23c68ee"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e722042467f01e93054c9c","title":"Reproductive Biology","issn":"1477-7827","documentHash":"fe097ffb-75b8-4aa8-82e6-0d6de3529780"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Toluene","Plant extracts","Ovary","Steroid hormones","Granulosa cells"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060357758"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e4896fdbe8322e23b8d60","name":"Yael","lastName":"Heifetz","documentHash":"55dcdee5-3efe-484d-801d-508d6d385fbd"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":"4C887615D8CF2C7AED96BBBF9BA5C5F08ED58C03893B40229F8B7BC60591947D230EB5884E4543FA7A07891B19A3B7714641EF4DB0922B7E97E35D4B3AAB996B","documentHash":"b2431fda-02ea-4ffb-9f2a-57ed6c3ab5d1"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a82d7","name":"Maria","lastName":"Guzewska","uuid":"0331AD1CF20FB8E16484AD4B8BB8990157C27ADE20D3C2FF54E14B0009ADCFC57AC311BA0F88A6863C3DA0EE012A2B6C858346F4B207B759016275B2164115F4","documentHash":"5b96efe6-ccd8-4a86-adfa-27faa0a4385c"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db9c","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Myszczyński","uuid":"880A7CE391BA7DF745800FB9596A2C112A2B128DE9399F4969165F4F51A342D98754FD80BEBA5C5FAADF1ADB8931FB55C6656B5025D06201AD30A5CDC9A16F71","orcidId":"0000-0002-3118-0900","documentHash":"935ccb74-19cd-46ea-8bd7-c8b1e73a2e49"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e4896fdbe8322e23b8d5e","doi":"10.1186/s12964-023-01221-1","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85168381145&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Embryonic signals mediate extracellular vesicle biogenesis and trafficking at the embryo–maternal interface","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-coated nanoparticles secreted by almost all cell types in living organisms. EVs, as paracrine mediators, are involved in intercellular communication, immune response, and several reproductive events, including the maintenance of pregnancy. Using a domestic animal model (Sus scrofa) with an epitheliochorial, superficial type of placentation, we focused on EV biogenesis pathway at the embryo–maternal interface, when the embryonic signaling occurs for maternal recognition and the maintenance of pregnancy. Results: Transmission electron microscopy was used during early pregnancy to visualize EVs and apocrine and/or merocrine pathways of secretion. Immunofluorescent staining localized proteins responsible for EV biogenesis and cell polarization at the embryo–maternal interface. The expression profiles of genes involved in biogenesis and the secretion of EVs pointed to the possible modulation of endometrial expression by embryonic signals. Further in vitro studies showed that factors of embryonic origin can regulate the expression of the ESCRT-II complex and EV trafficking within endometrial luminal epithelial cells. Moreover, miRNA-mediated rapid negative regulation of gene expression was abolished by delivered embryonic signals. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that embryonic signals are potent modulators of ESCRT-dependent EV-mediated secretory activity of the endometrium during the critical stages of early pregnancy.

The appropriate design of studies is essential for their quality, successful execution, and interpretation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the “gold standard” for intervention studies. However, the most recent large-scale (up to 25,000 participants), long-term RCTs involving vitamin D3 did not provide any statistically significant primary results. This may be because they are designed similarly to RCTs of a therapeutic drug but not of a nutritional compound and that only a limited set of parameters per individual were determined. We propose an alternative concept using the segregation of study participants into different groups of responsiveness to vitamin D3 supplementation and in parallel measuring a larger set of genome-wide parameters over multiple time points. This is in accordance with recently developed mechanistic modeling approaches that do not require a large number of study participants, as in the case of statistical modeling of the results of a RCT. Our experience is based on the vitamin D intervention trials VitDmet, VitDbol, and VitDHiD, which allowed us to distinguish the study participants into high, mid, and low vitamin D responders. In particular, investigating the vulnerable group of low vitamin D responders will provide future studies with more conclusive results both on the clinical and molecular benefits of vitamin D3 supplementation. In conclusion, our approach suggests a paradigm shift towards detailed investigations of transcriptome and epigenome-wide parameters of a limited set of individuals, who, due to a longitudinal design, can act as their own controls. © 2023 by the authors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut

rats","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study on Wistar rats was conducted to investigate the effects of a pharmacologically relevant dose 0.3 mg/kg body weight of chromium supplementation (commonly used picolinate or novel form as nanoparticles) and switching away from obesogenic dietary habits on the parameters of lipid metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress in liver and plasma. Favorable effects related to dietary changes from the obesogenic diet were considerably enhanced when the diet was supplemented with chromium nanoparticles. This combination exerted the strongest fat content and cholesterol reduction in the liver. Moreover, in this group, a favorable antioxidative effect was observed through GSH/GSSG elevation in the liver as well as ALT activity reduction in the plasma and IL-6 levels in the liver. The molecular mechanisms associated with regulating lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation might be related to lower expression of HIF-1α, COX-2, and LOX-1 and upregulation of PPARα in the liver. Supplementation with chromium nanoparticles without changes in the obesogenic diet also favorably affected lipid metabolism and oxidative stress in the liver; however, the examined effects were moderate.

Our previous research has confirmed that phoenixin-14 is involved in the development of cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH) and pyometra in dogs. Therefore, based on the similarities and interactions between these neuropeptides, we hypothesized that nesfatin-1 might also regulate the reproductive system in dogs. This study aimed to determine the expression of nesfatin-1 and its interaction with phoenixin-14 in dogs with CEH or pyometra compared to healthy females, and concerning animals’ body condition score (BCS 4–5/9 vs. BCS > 5/9). RESULTS: The analysis of nesfatin-1 in the uterus of bitches consisted of qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence assays, and ELISAs. The results showed significantly higher nesfatin-1 encoding gene, nucleobindin-2 mRNA (Nucb2) and nesfatin-1 protein expression in overweight females and those suffering from CEH or pyometra compared to healthy animals. The immunoreactivity of nesfatin-1 was elevated in the uteri of bitches with higher BCS > 5/9. Moreover, nesfatin-1 blood concentrations increased in all examined overweight bitches. In the case of phoenixin signals, we found opposite results, regardless of the female body condition score. CONCLUSION: The etiology of CEH and pyometra are not fully known, although we have expanded the level of knowledge with respect to the possible interaction of nesfatin-1 and phoenixin in female dogs’ uteri. They interact oppositely. With increasing female body weight, the expression of nesfatin-1 in the uterus and its peripheral blood concentration increased. However, for female dogs affected by CEH and pyometra, a decreased level of phoenixin-14, irrespective of their body condition score is characteristic. This knowledge could be crucial in the development of biomarkers for these conditions, which may lead to earlier recognition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb73"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"art. no 486 (1-11)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6773a21cfdbe833e3d16a9e3","6773a21cfdbe833e3d16a9e4","6773a21cfdbe833e3d16a9e5","6773a21cfdbe833e3d16a9e6","6773a21cfdbe833e3d16a9e7","6773a21cfdbe833e3d16a9e8","6773a21cfdbe833e3d16a9e9","6773a21cfdbe833e3d16a9ea","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb73"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773ef","mniswId":"2654","title":"BMC Veterinary Research","issn":"1746-6148","documentHash":"6e3ee891-ddbb-47d0-91fb-01fb02e28526"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Nesfatin-1","Phoenixin","Uterus","Reproductive diseases","Canine","BCS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060371664"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Judycka","uuid":"1BC4BF9E119F09531BF37A15CAB0B8930B3CEAD1AF40343466114BF77590C3D83197AC72C68511FBF2141C1C8BA5A439D9C46314ACF0CF765BCFB4F5151DB784","documentHash":"4562af07-7167-4f8c-8263-56fca5431f8e"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a9a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Nynca","uuid":"9E82C5936C039B79A324F23B55C43462134DBAA1208015B893257894A36FE8A2AB8D67CCBB71DD51FE30BB4FE32033795DB8A295C77CFA5F1F42800291CA5C9C","documentHash":"e8223465-a8e0-408d-aeea-7640f9a9ac3c"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a40","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Dietrich","uuid":"343890A86A171B3CF4DCC212604012207FA15F466B2B3EEEBDAE98B7B968A0A8F2EEF12CAE341C02833944BA387F7935D3E116CFE3F911843DFADCD34BA15BD2","documentHash":"93973a70-2b79-47b1-bb44-2c0b853a7a56"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Ciereszko","uuid":"8DDAA077AF44261DCF0520E5A544DC624790613E97D31A6E69866CA47B0BE48CA68261CB972862072612A15E8601DFB12A75BC79EB268AE20BF6FDE46BBDCFD3","documentHash":"4ffd62ff-6e05-41ff-9258-58db72ae7b17"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6772861afdbe831015c8b08d","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2024.1407895","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Preservation of fish male germplasm in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The natural resources of a country, including ichthyofauna, constitute a vital aspect of its national heritage. Fish populations are threatened with loss of biodiversity as a result of human activity (anthropopressure), resulting in water pollution, habitat destruction and overfishing. Additionally, the escalating threat is exacerbated by climate change, primarily manifested in periodic reservoir and watercourse desiccation. Genetic variability of captive is also threated as fish raised in hatcheries are susceptible to bacterial and viral diseases. Therefore, methodologies for fish sperm cryopreservation aimed at safeguarding the gene pool of both natural and captive fish populations assume paramount importance for their conservation and mitigation of irreversible losses, particularly crucial in light of increasing ecological disasters. This paper offers an overview of cryopreservation research in Poland, tracing back to early initiatives in the 1970s concerning carp (Cyprinus carpio) semen and culminating in recent advancements, where standardized cryopreservation methodologies were developed. We delve into the freezing results of semen of various fish species, encompassing both wild specimens like whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and lake minnows (Eupallasella percnurus), and farmed species such as sturgeons, carp, and numerous salmonid species. Additionally, we delineate projects that support such endeavors. Recent milestones in the establishment of fish sperm cryobanks in Poland catering to both wild and farmed species, including carp and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) – the most economically significant fish in Poland were presented. We also expound on the implementation of cryopreserved semen from sex-reversed rainbow trout in hatchery practices. Furthermore, we discuss significant challenges pertaining to sperm banking, particularly concerning funding and the practical utilization of cryostored semen samples for egg fertilization under hatchery conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a40","5e709410878c28a0473b5a9a","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"art. no 1407895 (1-9)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2","5e709410878c28a0473b5a40","5e709410878c28a0473b5a9a","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","eissn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"13b705fd-0ee8-473d-8c1a-633ddb25fa17"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sperm","cryopreservation","germplasm","cryobanking","biodiversity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060371669"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63589ba9752340623bc06a15","name":"Ranjini","lastName":"Ghosh Dastidar","uuid":"947E2AFE9E1D1CE9A5FB34F3800D98A41D4A138D4B783F584407487C803ADC9B534E6FE50B7CFAED8B6EB1B5AF07F2907FBD93C8EB922E95458710F1F7AC9412","documentHash":"1c5e48ed-fc41-4849-be02-9aa48f5384c2"},{"objectId":"6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","name":"Carsten","lastName":"Carlberg","uuid":"7A3E0E7963E1192270F3903EEFFAA1A086E27754D1B393FD104F68B8A691171F30A075FDFF073A66B06C35CCE685244FF4287E47226B5FB73CCE42A85608CA83","documentHash":"50649f30-9531-42e7-8c6c-543c2bbfecb8"},{"objectId":"5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c0e","name":"Julia","lastName":"Jarosławska-Miszkiewicz","uuid":"18C41BF13C62E3811D508951BA29C0BF46C71F2F3ED332E67E03A98C40B6C43613B3BDF890E63EE19A740E970B0563C6EE7706FB19448F4E3CF03587B3EA0A6A","documentHash":"3aed2fd6-2183-47df-94d4-d3949c65ecd1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-07-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67728527fdbe831015c8a762","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0306426","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85199391516&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"In vivo vitamin D target genes interconnect key signaling pathways of innate immunity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The vitamin D3 metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), its nuclear receptor VDR (vitamin D receptor) and hundreds of their target genes are not only key regulators of calcium homeostasis, but also important modulators of the immune system. Innate immune cells like monocytes use VDR for efficient differentiation and are very responsive to vitamin D. So far, most information on the gene regulatory function of vitamin D and its physiological impact had been obtained from in vitro studies using supraphysiological doses of 1,25(OH)2D3. Therefore, medical experiments like the study VitDHiD (NCT03537027), where 25 healthy individuals were supplemented once with a vitamin D3 bolus (80,000 IU), provide important insight into the response to vitamin D under in vivo conditions. In this study, we inspected 452 in vivo vitamin D target genes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) detected in VitDHiD and found 61 of them involved in eight major KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways of innate immunity. Under in vivo conditions in healthy individuals vitamin D either silences five pathways of innate immunity, stabilizes two and increases one, so that acute inflammation is suppressed and the release of cytokines is kept under control. A ranking of the 61 target genes by inducibility, basal expression and multiple involvements in the pathways highlighted the genes NFKBIA (NFκB inhibitor alpha), NFKBIZ, FOSL2 (FOS like 2, AP1 transcription factor subunit), JDP2 (Jun dimerization protein 2), PIK3R1 (phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1), CLEC7A (C-type lectin domain containing 7A), DUSP6 (dual specificity phosphatase 6), NCF2 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 2), PLCB1 (phospholipase C beta 1), PLCG2 and TNFAIP3 (TNF alpha induced protein 3). In conclusion, vitamin D’s in vivo effect on innate immunity in healthy adults is mediated by the interconnection of the pathways of neutrophil extracellular trap formation, Toll-like receptor, chemokine and phagosome signaling, NOD-like receptor, C-type lectin receptor, apoptosis and interleukin 17 through a limited set of proteins encoded by key target genes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63589ba9752340623bc06a15","6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c0e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"art. no e0306426 (1-19)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c0e","63589ba9752340623bc06a15","6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS One","issn":"1932-6203","documentHash":"87dd74d5-f634-4b66-bcf0-d154d5329196"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060371937"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61d510b87523401fc110f957","name":"Manohara","lastName":"Mahadeva","uuid":"B3FE2AE2E9E344E968F163C9DC365C7300486F95C9128B7B51B0B20749853FE2E01A04F86772CB9E4269F19C73DEA05E3BF3ECC6629C42B288DB288B35803F35","documentHash":"73fd790e-b549-4ecb-a0ef-932262f95918"},{"objectId":"5e7094b3878c28a0473c1df3","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kowacz","uuid":"E53E9875396BEEED9291BD0D53FE6CCBDF214374BF249850F3E9A84DD949BCFB057F6F5A63DE42450C1C4EE46B539508EED2C09E9BF12DA177FC62724D4684D5","documentHash":"03d56860-f8c0-4642-99f5-546a4de878e4"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db74","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Niestępski","uuid":"A548A904F1FFB01EE0FA581389ED399BD66C5A98E3AC0F3B89A62C29BC989F2D02FA02F779174C742A6C42E2F524E80A8B6DAAD06E0951D6C140F4F6A997473E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3524-821X","documentHash":"8e849844-8f0f-4dc9-b396-16b172cf0e19"}],"objectId":"677297fafdbe831015ca2f33","doi":"10.1016/j.bpc.2024.107199","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85184751095&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Dependence of cell's membrane potential on extracellular voltage observed in Chara globularis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The membrane potential (Vm) of a cell results from the selective movement of ions across the cell membrane. Recent studies have revealed the presence of a gradient of voltage within a few nanometers adjacent to erythrocytes. Very notably this voltage is modified in response to changes in cell's membrane potential thus effectively extending the potential beyond the membrane and into the solution. In this study, using the microelectrode technique, we provide experimental evidence for the existence of a gradient of negative extracellular voltage (Vz) in a wide zone close to the cell wall of algal cells, extending over several micrometers. Modulating the ionic concentration of the extracellular solution with CO2 alters the extracellular voltage and causes an immediate change in Vm. Elevated extracellular CO2 levels depolarize the cell and hyperpolarize the zone of extracellular voltage (ZEV) by the same magnitude. This observation strongly suggests a coupling effect between Vz and Vm. An increase in the level of intracellular CO2 (dark respiration) leads to hyperpolarization of the cell without any immediate effect on the extracellular voltage. Therefore, the metabolic activity of a cell can proceed without inducing changes in Vz. Conversely, Vz can be modified by external stimulation without metabolic input from the cell. The evolution of the ZEV, particularly around spines and wounded cells, where ion exchange is enhanced, suggests that the formation of the ZEV may be attributed to the exchange of ions across the cell wall and cell membrane. By comparing the changes in Vm in response to external stimuli, as measured by electrodes and observed using a potential-sensitive dye, we provide experimental evidence demonstrating the significance of extracellular voltage in determining the cell's membrane potential. This may have implications for our understanding of cell membrane potential generation beyond the activities of ion channels."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b3878c28a0473c1df3","61d510b87523401fc110f957","5e7092d6878c28a04739db74"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"307","pagesFromTo":"art. no 107199 (1-11)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61d510b87523401fc110f957","5e7092d6878c28a04739db74","5e7094b3878c28a0473c1df3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477382","mniswId":"2519","title":"Biophysical Chemistry","doi":"10.1016/j.bpc","issn":"0301-4622","eissn":"1873-4200","websiteLink":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03014622","documentHash":"3dd0b528-5e06-41f8-a08b-5925242f53e9"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Chara globularis","Colloid exclusion","Extracellular voltage","Membrane potential","Microelectrode technique"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060372082"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62a009a8752340212cd2f056","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Klejbuk","uuid":"D7D1EE17770A34E6AC900455F28C1E9332A46C8F862444B5020D3386F47A6887EB956A0A542C9CC0A19AF5B091FEF18E7527DCF55B88EF1FC353E11C9E2C5AD0","documentHash":"6c995468-d532-4d2d-9df8-414982dd2a8b"},{"objectId":"5e709377878c28a0473aa543","name":"Marek","lastName":"Strączkowski","uuid":"4C90BD5CD933657E8C2E13468D0F43F9A1D03D3C42022BE096D7702400C2E683808300DF5F10899E73239C8A7EDE44524339338D4753052D40652B8E115B9111","documentHash":"1bcfdfb0-ae43-4864-a1d9-9c4626cfc48d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2024-04-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"677292f7fdbe831015c9d287","doi":"10.20452/pamw.16721","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Impact of weight loss on the expression of negative regulators of nuclear factor κB (NLRP12, NLRC3, and NLRX1) in subcutaneous adipose tissue","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"INTRODUCTION: Insulin resistance can be defined as a state of impaired response to insulin in insulin-targeted tissues. Insulin resistance is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease (CVD), metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and polycystic ovary syndrome.1,2 Adipose tissue (AT) is an important factor in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, as disturbances in its function contribute to development of low-grade chronic inflammation, which impairs insulin sensitivity. AT contains various immune cells, which regulate metabolic processes and immune responses of adaptive and innate immune system. The innate immune system recognizes a pathogen and aims to eliminate it, while causing the least possible damage to the host organism. A key component of the innate immune system is inflammation, which can be either of short duration (acute) or persist for a long time (chronic). The nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway plays a main role in the regulation of inflammation. Dysregulation in inflammation onset can result in low-grade chronic inflammation, which is one of the main contributors to development of insulin resistance. The function of the innate immune system response depends on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). PRRs can be divided into 5 groups, including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs).3 The primary role of NLRs is to detect cytosolic PAMPs and DAMPs, inducing and regulating downstream signaling cascades that result in an inflammatory response. Several members of the NLR family, including NLRC3, NLRP12, and NLRX1, function as suppressors of excessive proinflammatory signaling through the NFκB pathway, whether it is the canonical or noncanonical pathway.4 These NLRs bind to signaling molecules of the NFκB pathway, inhibiting its activity, reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and preventing the activation of downstream signaling pathways. NLRC3 is widely expressed throughout the body, but it is predominantly found in various immune system tissues.5 It has been shown to inhibit the activity of several key pathways, including the NFκB, STING, and PI3K-mTOR ones.6,7 NLRP12 is expressed in various immune cells, including monocytes, dendritic cells, and granulocytes.8 NLRP12 can function both as an inflammasome and a negative regulator of inflammation.9 NLRX1 is expressed ubiquitously in various types of tissues. Its primary function is to negatively regulate antiviral immune response by suppressing multiple inflammatory pathways.10 So far, there have been no publications reporting the AT expression of NLRs in humans after weight loss. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) genes being 3 members of the NLR family, NLRP12, NLRC3, and NLRX1, before and after dietary intervention (DI) in relation to insulin sensitivity in individuals with obesity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62a009a8752340212cd2f056","5e709377878c28a0473aa543"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"134","pagesFromTo":"art. no 16721 (1-4)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62a009a8752340212cd2f056","5e709377878c28a0473aa543"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff4baad49b31ccec1afa8","title":"Polish Archives of Internal Medicine/Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnętrznej","issn":"0032-3772","eissn":"1897-9483","documentHash":"57ab6904-563c-4a09-87d3-b68367c76f8d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060372110"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67729563fdbe831015ca1984","name":"Irina","lastName":"Kowalska","documentHash":"79855d81-c89f-4d02-9466-50f0ebd494e6"},{"objectId":"67729563fdbe831015ca1983","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Wołczyński","documentHash":"33bf628d-9ae5-4a88-a5d9-5fb04011a4a7"},{"objectId":"67729563fdbe831015ca1982","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Hryniewicka","documentHash":"b22d5ef9-c753-4628-a79d-ac62fb91a826"},{"objectId":"67729563fdbe831015ca1981","name":"Gabiela","lastName":"Milewska","documentHash":"9c3b2625-39d7-4532-9474-4ba8c970153a"},{"objectId":"67729563fdbe831015ca1980","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Adamska","documentHash":"520d307a-3e63-4e91-8412-837de8af518e"},{"objectId":"67729563fdbe831015ca197f","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Łebkowska","documentHash":"9f2142bc-f8be-4b4d-86d7-1ee662af3202"},{"objectId":"67729563fdbe831015ca197e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Krentowska","documentHash":"b0e3c49e-0d11-4f61-951c-a0c9db1603c7"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7","name":"Donata","lastName":"Ponikwicka-Tyszko","uuid":"4C35B3EDE357FD25F5812AD7BFAA18400890491C49FE69152441B7233A793EFD09392BB58F197C713C5EE6E5927A0395F623A44B7AD99CE5C735682C01E90555","documentHash":"e93e992c-e87b-4c53-bd72-ba444a6e657b"},{"objectId":"5e70922d878c28a04739129c","name":"Maria","lastName":"Sztachelska","uuid":"49CA98C67526B1B5242E11EA8285B256A16191DA1656276E1EBC7FFD6F1E7583995D781A9144EB0225A9A79DC77C815618F7E3607EC0C9C93A7511F2A975EC7C","documentHash":"0a9b3232-1b52-4038-b756-45896439c240"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2024-01-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67729563fdbe831015ca197d","doi":"10.20452/pamw.16637","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85184345025&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Serum expression levels of selected microRNAs and their association with glucose metabolism in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"INTRODUCTION: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with metabolic disturbances, such as insulin resistance and prediabetes, and the risk for their occurrence is especially increased in hyperandrogenic (HA) phenotypes of PCOS. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) may be involved in PCOS pathogenesis and regulation of metabolic processes. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess expression levels of selected circulating miRNAs in women with PCOS and to investigate the relationship of these miRNAs with glucose metabolism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 95 patients with HA-PCOS and 76 healthy women similar to the study group in age and body mass index. Measurements of sex hormone concentrations, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and transvaginal ultrasonography were performed. Serum levels of selected miRNAs (miR-27a, miR-34a, miR-106b, miR-193b, miR-181a, miR-181b, and miR-320) were assessed with real-time polymerase chain reaction, and their association with PCOS and glucose metabolism parameters was studied. RESULTS: Serum levels of all studied miRNAs, except for miR-34a, differed between the patients with HA-PCOS and healthy women (all P <⁠0.05). In HA-PCOS, miR-27a and miR-320 levels correlated with fasting glucose (R = 0.33; P = 0.001 and R = –0.35; P <⁠0.001, respectively) and insulin concentrations (R = 0.26; P = 0.01 and R = –0.23; P = 0.03, respectively). Additionally, the level of miR-27a correlated with mean glucose concentration during OGTT (R = 0.26; P = 0.01). No such correlations were observed in the healthy women. In linear regression analyses, both miR-27a and miR-320 were associated with fasting glucose concentrations after adjustment for potentially confounding factors in the HA-PCOS group only. CONCLUSIONS: The expression profile of circulating miRNAs is altered in patients with HA-PCOS. Circulating miR-27a and miR-320 could serve as potential biomarkers of glucose metabolism disturbances in PCOS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej

the growth, synthesis, and accumulation of the extracellular matrix in uterine leiomyomas. DESIGN: Laboratory study. SETTING: Academic Research Institutions. PATIENTS (S): This study involved reproductive-age women diagnosed with infertility associated uterine leiomyomas who underwent myomectomy either after selective progesterone receptor modulator ulipristal acetate (UA) treatment or without any pharmacological pretreatment. Control samples included healthy myometrium tissue (n = 100). Specimens were obtained from the Department of Reproduction and Gynecological Endocrinology and Biobank, Medical University of Bialystok, Poland. INTERVENTIONS: Daily (5 mg/d) UA treated for 2 months (n = 100) and untreated (n = 150) patients with uterine leiomyomas or normal healthy myometrium (n = 100) tissue samples immediately after surgery were collected for transcriptional analysis and assessments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Progesterone-induced activation of the signaling pathways related to uterine leiomyomas extracellular matrix synthesis, deposition, and growth, as well as the expression profile of progesterone receptors in uterine leiomyomas, were assessed. RESULTS: The results indicated that progesterone activated the transforming growth factor-β and SMAD3 signaling pathways and promoted proliferation, growth, and extracellular matrix remodeling in uterine leiomyomas by up-regulating SMAD3, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor type 1 and II, Ras homolog A, vascular endothelial growth factor, or increasing the fibrosis-related gene collagen, type I, ɑ-1, and procollagen, type I, ɑ-1 production. In contrast, UA had inhibitory effects on these processes. The study also showed that both nuclear and membrane progesterone receptors play distinct roles in uterine leiomyoma pathobiology. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that both nuclear and membrane progesterone receptors were relevant in the treatment of uterine leiomyomas, especially when combined with selective progesterone receptor modulators. Novel therapeutic approaches combining selective progesterone receptor modulators with or without direct and indirect extracellular matrix targeting through selected specifically TGF-β and SMAD3 (SMAD3, TGF-β receptor types 1 and II, Ras homolog A, vascular endothelial growth factor, collagen, type I, ɑ-1) signaling pathways could therefore be a treatment option for uterine leiomyomas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa22d","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f3","5e70922d878c28a04739129c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"122","pagesFromTo":"341-351","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67738ec0fdbe833e3d157274","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7","67738ec0fdbe833e3d157275","67738ec0fdbe833e3d157276","67738ec0fdbe833e3d157277","5e70922d878c28a04739129c","67738ec0fdbe833e3d157278","67738ec0fdbe833e3d157279","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f3","67738ec0fdbe833e3d15727a","67738ec0fdbe833e3d15727b","67738ec0fdbe833e3d15727c","67738ec0fdbe833e3d15727d","67738ec0fdbe833e3d15727e","5e709375878c28a0473aa22d","67738ec0fdbe833e3d15727f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477cbb","mniswId":"6553","title":"Fertility and Sterility","issn":"0015-0282","eissn":"1556-5653","documentHash":"ca1584f8-622e-40c7-8eb3-e590bdebeced"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Leiomyoma","progesterone","selective progesterone receptor modulator","extracellular matrix","growth factors"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060372170"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67728f40fdbe831015c96e0c","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Stefanowicz","documentHash":"3a73830a-b8d2-4080-9aaf-68f0b5ad31d6"},{"objectId":"67728f40fdbe831015c96e0b","name":"Monika","lastName":"Karczewska-Kupczewska","documentHash":"02bcf110-70d1-4df6-8a55-ab6e01c02744"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be65e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Nikołajuk","uuid":"ECE44D65FDF55B65918495AD166EBED022AF883020D0ECDF0F2F39309688C11BF41B509DD5B836411281E0D2F9AE95B1D37B606E83F5CF6C0A124A3711C4E6BF","documentHash":"9e359efb-a976-41a0-b041-93d57c2a25cc"},{"objectId":"5e709377878c28a0473aa543","name":"Marek","lastName":"Strączkowski","uuid":"4C90BD5CD933657E8C2E13468D0F43F9A1D03D3C42022BE096D7702400C2E683808300DF5F10899E73239C8A7EDE44524339338D4753052D40652B8E115B9111","documentHash":"1bcfdfb0-ae43-4864-a1d9-9c4626cfc48d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2024-07-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67728f40fdbe831015c96e0a","doi":"10.20452/pamw.16797","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Association of skeletal muscle karyopherin α1 and α2 with myogenesis and insulin action","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"\"Insulin resistance has been previously linked with impaired myogenic / regenerative potential of skeletal muscle.1 Low muscle mass and its coexistence with obesity (sarcopenic obesity) is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D).2 Individuals with newly diagnosed T2D have a lower ratio of lean mass to fat mass, as compared with nondiabetic individuals. In adult life, skeletal muscle myogenic / regenerative potential is enabled by muscle stem cells, referred to as satellite cells. Upon activation, satellite cells generate myoblasts, which proliferate and subsequently differentiate and fuse into multinucleated myofibers.4 Myogenesis is controlled by transcription factors; myoblast determination protein 1 and myogenic factor are one of the earliest factors involved in satellite cell proliferation, whereas myogenin is expressed during differentiation. Satellite cells constitute approximately 4% of cells in adult muscle5; myonuclear turnover is 1%–2% per week.6 Depletion of satellite cells was shown to negatively impact running volume and muscle fiber hypertrophy.7 Satellite cells contribute to myofibers in all young and old adult muscles, in the absence of injury.8,9 Small myofiber injuries, which occur during routine daily activity, lead to satellite cell activation.10 In humans, a correlation between satellite cell content and muscle ability to hypertrophy11 and contribution to nonhypertrophic muscle remodeling12 was described. The presence of activated satellite cells was demonstrated in healthy adult muscle at rest. Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors and chromatin remodeling factors, synthesized in the cytoplasm but exerting their effects in the nucleus.14 Macromolecules require nuclear transport receptors enabling transport through the pore complexes in the nuclear envelope. Such transport is possible thanks to karyopherins, which are classical nuclear import receptors.14,15 The KPNA1 and KPNA2 genes encode karyopherin α1 (KPNA1) and karyopherin α2 (KPNA2), respectively. Both proteins influence myogenesis, but act independently of and oppositely to each other. We have recently demonstrated that runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) in muscle may play a role in modulation of insulin action through its effect on myogenesis, which suggests that myogenic / regenerative potential of adult skeletal muscle may be an important determinant of insulin sensitivity.16 In our study, we hypothesized that nuclear import through karyopherins may play a role in modulating insulin action, and that this effect may be related to skeletal muscle myogenic / regenerative potential. A study carried out in young individuals without possible confounding factors, such as morbid obesity or hyperglycemia, may allow for the estimation of an early association between nuclear import, myogenesis, and insulin sensitivity. \nThe aim of the present study was to analyze the association between skeletal muscle KPNA1 and KPNA2 and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, we aimed to assess whether the potential effect of karyopherins is dependent on myogenesis.\""}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947f878c28a0473be65e","5e709377878c28a0473aa543"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"134","pagesFromTo":"art. no 16797 (1-5)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67728f40fdbe831015c96e0b","67728f40fdbe831015c96e0c","5e70947f878c28a0473be65e","5e709377878c28a0473aa543"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff4baad49b31ccec1afa8","title":"Polish Archives of Internal Medicine/Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnętrznej","issn":"0032-3772","eissn":"1897-9483","documentHash":"57ab6904-563c-4a09-87d3-b68367c76f8d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060372221"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1afe","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Stefanowicz","uuid":"ED3369B5BFF1FCCBD11A9F8A7D34597148902C6A4EADF5F84A60EA28B2F961E57A6B6B7C081A99AC1B7DAC4D40288B15856E2377C229AC300246A454AE541ED3","orcidId":"0000-0002-1455-7841","documentHash":"bdd1b92b-8a51-4570-a7b6-b140a646262e"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be65e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Nikołajuk","uuid":"ECE44D65FDF55B65918495AD166EBED022AF883020D0ECDF0F2F39309688C11BF41B509DD5B836411281E0D2F9AE95B1D37B606E83F5CF6C0A124A3711C4E6BF","documentHash":"9e359efb-a976-41a0-b041-93d57c2a25cc"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7da8","name":"Monika","lastName":"Karczewska-Kupczewska","uuid":"65C48CC698AFDA3F7DD2D0E72F447D4DB18CA7FBB09F943B143814653FCBC9840457D007183D26EEBE53A61727CF3B2FC7A0BFD30ACA872612F117CB9F8A61F1","orcidId":"0000-0003-1396-4290","documentHash":"8aa9f500-b7c7-4830-9ef0-6fba8681236f"},{"objectId":"5e709377878c28a0473aa543","name":"Marek","lastName":"Strączkowski","uuid":"4C90BD5CD933657E8C2E13468D0F43F9A1D03D3C42022BE096D7702400C2E683808300DF5F10899E73239C8A7EDE44524339338D4753052D40652B8E115B9111","documentHash":"1bcfdfb0-ae43-4864-a1d9-9c4626cfc48d"}],"objectId":"677648e6fdbe833e694fa017","doi":"10.1016/j.clnu.2024.11.006","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The effect of diet-induced weight-loss on subcutaneous adipose tissue expression of genes associated with thyroid hormone action","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: We have recently demonstrated that subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) expression of genes associated with thyroid hormone (TH) action is altered in obesity and insulin resistance. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of diet-induced weight-loss on SAT expression of genes associated with TH action. METHODS: The study group comprised 38 individuals with overweight/obesity, which completed 12-week dietary intervention program. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and SAT biopsy were performed before and after the program. Fifteen normal-weight individuals were examined at baseline only. RESULTS: Overweight/obese individuals had lower free thyroxine (fT4) and higher free triiodothyronine (fT3)/fT4 ratio, lower SAT TH receptor isoforms (TRα and TRβ, encoded by THRA and THRB, respectively) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PPARGC1A) mRNA expression and higher SAT type II and type III iodothyronine deiodinase (encoded by DIO2 and DIO3, respectively) and nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR1) mRNA expression in comparison with normal-weight individuals. Diet-induced weight loss resulted in a decrease in fT3 and fT3/fT4 ratio and an increase in SAT THRA, THRB and PPARGC1A. SAT NCOR1 and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) decreased only in individuals, who lost at least 10 kg (n = 20). Higher increase in insulin sensitivity after weight loss was associated with a lower decrease in fT3/fT4 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Diet-induced weight loss partly reverses alterations in SAT expression of genes associated with TH action. Responses of circulating TH and SAT expression of genes associated with TH action to diet-induced weight loss are related to body weight and insulin sensitivity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947f878c28a0473be65e","5e709377878c28a0473aa543"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"43","pagesFromTo":"245-250","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709377878c28a0473aa543","5e7094af878c28a0473c1afe","5e70947f878c28a0473be65e","5e709430878c28a0473b7da8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454776c6","mniswId":"3879","title":"Clinical Nutrition","doi":"10.1016/j.clnu","issn":"0261-5614","eissn":"1532-1983","websiteLink":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/02615614","documentHash":"dba06f7b-552a-46cd-bd12-605765986a1e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Obesity","Subcutaneous adipose tissue","Thyroid hormone","Weight loss"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060375256"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67764ac4fdbe833e694fb7e5","name":"Manpreet","lastName":"Kaur","documentHash":"6959b402-7c8c-4252-826f-7515dc3f4db4"},{"objectId":"67764ac4fdbe833e694fb7e4","name":"Rajendra","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"dcff9488-78be-4a6c-9d88-0deed5e4e848"},{"objectId":"67764ac4fdbe833e694fb7e3","name":"M.

This study aims to compare the risk of sensitization between chicken TM and shrimp TM through affecting the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and type 2 mucosal immune activation. Methods: Epithelial activation and/or barrier effects upon exposure to 2–50 μg/mL chicken TM, shrimp TM or ovalbumin (OVA) as a control allergen, were studied using Caco-2, HT-29MTX, or HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC), cocultured with HT-29 cells or moDC alone, were exposed to 50 μg/mL chicken TM or shrimp TM. Primed moDC were cocultured with naïve Th cells. Intestinal barrier integrity (TEER), gene expression, cytokine secretion and immune cell phenotypes were determined in these human in vitro models. Results: Shrimp TM, but not chicken TM or OVA exposure, profoundly disrupted intestinal barrier integrity and increased alarmin genes expression in Caco-2 cells. Proinflammatory cytokine secretion in HT-29 cells was only enhanced upon shrimp TM or OVA, but not chicken TM, exposure. Shrimp TM enhanced the maturation of moDC and chemokine secretion in the presence or absence of HT-29 cells, while only in the absence of epithelial cells chicken TM activated moDC. Direct exposure of moDC to shrimp TM increased IL13 and TNFα secretion by Th cells cocultured with these primed moDC, while shrimp TM exposure via HT-29 cells cocultured with moDC sequentially increased IL13 expression and IL4 secretion in Th cells. Conclusions: Shrimp TM, but not chicken TM, disrupted the epithelial barrier while triggering type 2 mucosal immune activation, both of which are key events in allergic sensitization."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b590a","5e709442878c28a0473b910c","5e709411878c28a0473b5aef"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"art. no 1192 (1-15)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67765c77fdbe833e69509d53","5e709442878c28a0473b910c","67765c77fdbe833e69509d54","67765c77fdbe833e69509d55","67765c77fdbe833e69509d56","67765c77fdbe833e69509d57","5e70940f878c28a0473b590a","5e709411878c28a0473b5aef","67765c77fdbe833e69509d58","67765c77fdbe833e69509d59","67765c77fdbe833e69509d5a","67765c77fdbe833e69509d5b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","issn":"2072-6643","documentHash":"c19e39d9-34f9-43a7-9c35-a6b3e3ec2726"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["epithelial barrier","mucosal immunology","sensitizing allergenicity","food allergy","tropomyosins"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060375368"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677657edfdbe833e69506d4d","name":"Jura","lastName":"Magdalena","documentHash":"e9bb86f5-da57-485b-a3f7-41cebba2f0f0"},{"objectId":"677657edfdbe833e69506d4c","name":"Šentjurc","lastName":"Tjaša","documentHash":"061b3dc0-db59-410d-a263-4ac578290715"},{"objectId":"643e00a940e3ff4630cf9902","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Walewska","uuid":"A311F3B167E36957DFC121329E73CDE66A7FD01F583C4772617A9ECF4A4E7B8F64274D502A679B6473F7B491FED0130C9CA67CB26B0FC51ED854B4E54E630081","documentHash":"a9a3bf6b-f838-488d-b29c-52013ad4d40a"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c1217","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Laniecka","uuid":"C40646D80EDF1B1627FD0836E00F6392B9D7148926B682D67DBA5EFE655CC2D36D95F3D112ED6369AD9C1EDD904F4CB7AAF5AB62A9A45B5A14AE4A3C8CCBF3F3","documentHash":"4e6a79f3-5a73-4d26-8c43-3a5ddbc6fe35"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be651","name":"Antonio","lastName":"Galvao","uuid":"5A9970BD63136AC36977A7DC723492E0D4A0F2BBDF9F487E97825701E2D171AE46970BDB092A5024B5417E3B9310CD07E812F234D63DDCDC96D70EC4C6138BBB","documentHash":"09e003e0-4c92-4616-950e-0877013375b2"},{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac2ed","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Wołodko","uuid":"A6265FB3C834FD52F15333079A4E8C84E7E33DBCF66F802DD89E7D4B49A2F345E0A8C2D99787E7BEACDCDC4A2DB1F054663B8A2E55A6D69EF61C87D3973E9B15","documentHash":"f8b73afe-18fb-455c-9304-010fdec3e9ee"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-11-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"677657edfdbe833e69506d4b","doi":"10.1016/j.molmet.2024.102062","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Increased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity in female mice impairs ovarian steroidogenesis: The role of elevated leptin signalling on nodal activity inhibition in theca cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"OBJECTIVES: Susceptibility to obesity in humans is driven by the intricate interplay of genetic, environmental and behavioural factors. Moreover, the mechanisms linking maternal obesity to infertility remain largely understudied. In this study, we investigated how variable susceptibility to obesity in mice affects ovarian steroidogenesis, with a particular focus on the leptin-mediated dysregulation of Nodal signalling pathway in theca cells (TC). METHODS: C56BL/6J (B6) and 129S1/SvlmJ (129) mice, models of maternal obesity (MO), were fed a chow diet (CD) and a high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. To investigate the contrasting effects of leptin on ovarian steroidogenesis, B6 mice pharmacologically treated with leptin for 16 days on CD were used to model hyperleptinemia, while homozygous ob/ob (−/−) mice with genetic leptin deficiency, also on a CD, were used to examine the effects of obesity in the absence of leptin. Following the characterisation of the mouse phenotype, gonadal fat (GON), whole ovaries (WO), ovarian TC and granulosa cell (GC) fractions were collected for mRNA transcription and protein expression analysis. Finally, in vitro treated ovarian explants obtained from B6 mice were used to further elucidate the effects of Nodal on steroidogenesis. RESULTS: The significant gain in body weight (BW) and fat mass (FM) in HFD-fed B6 mice (p < 0.05), was associated with increased mRNA transcription of the adipose tissue expansion genes Polymerase I and transcript release factor (Cavin), Secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (Sfrp5) and Mesoderm specific transcript (Mest) in GON (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the HFD-fed B6 mice presented also impaired glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity (p < 0.05). In contrast, the HFD-fed 129 mice exhibited no changes in BW and FM, maintaining glucose and insulin metabolism. At the ovarian level, decreased protein expression of Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein (StAR) in WO obtained from HFD-fed B6 mice (p = 0.05), was followed by reduced transcription of key steroidogenic genes like Star and Cytochrome P450 17a1 (Cyp17a) in TC (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the transcription of Nodal and its receptors was downregulated (p < 0.05), whereas mRNA levels of Suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (Socs3) and SMAD family member 7 (Smad7) were upregulated in TC obtained from HFD-fed B6 mice (p < 0.05). No changes were seen in the genes regulating steroidogenesis, Nodal signalling, or Socs3 and Smad7 activity in the ovaries of HFD-fed 129 mice. Importantly, the pharmacological treatment of lean mice with leptin, upregulated the ovarian transcription of Socs3 and Smad7, while downregulating Nodal and its receptors (p < 0.05). Finally, in vitro pharmacological inhibition of Nodal signalling pathway in ovarian explants isolated from CD-fed B6 mice decreased the transcription of Star and Cyp17a in TC (p < 0.05), whereas Nodal treatment of explants obtained from HFD-fed B6 mice restored the transcription of both genes (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Increasesusceptibility to obesity in MO is associated with systemic hyperleptinemia and hypoestrogenism due to compromised ovarian steroidogenesis, largely driven by the inhibitory effects of leptin-Smad7 pathway on Nodal signalling activity in the TC compartment of ovarian follicles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["677657edfdbe833e69506d4d","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1217","677657edfdbe833e69506d4c","5e709389878c28a0473ac2ed","5e70947f878c28a0473be651","643e00a940e3ff4630cf9902"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"91","pagesFromTo":"art. no 102062 (1-17)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709389878c28a0473ac2ed","677657edfdbe833e69506d4c","643e00a940e3ff4630cf9902","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1217","677657edfdbe833e69506d4d","5e70947f878c28a0473be651"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478efb","mniswId":"14560","title":"Molecular Metabolism","issn":"2212-8778","eissn":"2212-8778","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"05d33280-87b7-4f97-895c-07ac97431d5d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Diet induced-obesity","Ovarian steroidogenesis","Nodal","Leptin"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060375421"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67765600fdbe833e69505fb7","name":"Vicente","lastName":"Perez-Garcia","documentHash":"6fb18c67-0ea8-4839-b3d9-cfd054789c20"},{"objectId":"67765600fdbe833e69505fb6","name":"Gavin","lastName":"Kelsey","documentHash":"a6412148-0f60-4542-87c4-d5c8418d661e"},{"objectId":"67765600fdbe833e69505fb5","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Alvarez-Sanchez","documentHash":"d90a5af3-8cd4-4bc0-9db3-fb346b3cc8f7"},{"objectId":"643e00a940e3ff4630cf9902","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Walewska","uuid":"A311F3B167E36957DFC121329E73CDE66A7FD01F583C4772617A9ECF4A4E7B8F64274D502A679B6473F7B491FED0130C9CA67CB26B0FC51ED854B4E54E630081","documentHash":"a9a3bf6b-f838-488d-b29c-52013ad4d40a"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c1217","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Laniecka","uuid":"C40646D80EDF1B1627FD0836E00F6392B9D7148926B682D67DBA5EFE655CC2D36D95F3D112ED6369AD9C1EDD904F4CB7AAF5AB62A9A45B5A14AE4A3C8CCBF3F3","documentHash":"4e6a79f3-5a73-4d26-8c43-3a5ddbc6fe35"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be651","name":"Antonio","lastName":"Galvao","uuid":"5A9970BD63136AC36977A7DC723492E0D4A0F2BBDF9F487E97825701E2D171AE46970BDB092A5024B5417E3B9310CD07E812F234D63DDCDC96D70EC4C6138BBB","documentHash":"09e003e0-4c92-4616-950e-0877013375b2"},{"objectId":"5e7093e1878c28a0473b2809","name":"Karol","lastName":"Makowczenko","uuid":"FC0BCA03095AD65BEC80BF96516EE86332A077895FDBB24C8D84416535FFFBA155B14D24119850FABD9C40FAF93A0FE0C7784D108D1AA03430597DEB9C080EC2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3758-4452","documentHash":"c58ab5e9-6c9b-4e3c-9000-915a43a08071"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db8c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Witek","uuid":"2C277E5FD80A3685542869ABB834EEFC96FCB19A85844FD840648650CB8E9DCB4B3E1E6E62EF230BE14075E4A0E8375D3ACCD85CC5AEC73B48C2CFBCCA52E255","documentHash":"e1a5256d-3292-4679-9304-2b6a5b39c8f0"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db87","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Molcan","uuid":"B274F0F0402F667FFDC2EFE54FB63C2F066BEE7BED2934875DEBD1C448EB7CEA8BA5FB8969DA171C5D585656110F154500066A42E10808F24D41EBEC07F299D6","documentHash":"2c773c54-b7a7-41b9-91c9-f9c702299ce5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67765600fdbe833e69505fb4","doi":"10.1007/s00018-024-05336-7","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Fetal growth restriction and placental defects in obese mice are associated with impaired decidualisation: the role of increased leptin signalling modulators SOCS3 and PTPN2","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Decidualisation of the endometrium is a key event in early pregnancy, which enables embryo implantation. Importantly, the molecular processes impairing decidualisation in obese mothers are yet to be characterised. We hypothesise that impaired decidualisation in obese mice is mediated by the upregulation of leptin modulators, the suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) and the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2), together with the disruption of progesterone (P4)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) signalling. After feeding mice with chow diet (CD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks, we confirmed the downregulation of P4 and oestradiol (E2) steroid receptors in decidua from embryonic day (E) 6.5 and decreased proliferation of stromal cells from HFD. In vitro decidualised mouse endometrial stromal cells (MESCs) and E6.5 deciduas from the HFD showed decreased expression of decidualisation markers, followed by the upregulation of SOCS3 and PTPN2 and decreased phosphorylation of STAT3. In vivo and in vitro leptin treatment of mice and MESCs mimicked the results observed in the obese model. The downregulation of Socs3 and Ptpn2 after siRNA transfection of MESCs from HFD mice restored the expression level of decidualisation markers. Finally, DIO mice placentas from E18.5 showed decreased labyrinth development and vascularisation and fetal growth restricted embryos. The present study revealed major defects in decidualisation in obese mice, characterised by altered uterine response to E2 and P4 steroid signalling. Importantly, altered hormonal response was associated with increased expression of leptin signalling modulators SOCS3 and PTPN2. Elevated levels of SOCS3 and PTPN2 were shown to molecularly affect decidualisation in obese mice, potentially disrupting the STAT3-PR regulatory molecular hub."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d6878c28a04739db87","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1217","5e7093e1878c28a0473b2809","5e70947f878c28a0473be651","5e7092d6878c28a04739db8c","643e00a940e3ff4630cf9902"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"81","pagesFromTo":"art. no 329 (1-20)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["643e00a940e3ff4630cf9902","5e7093e1878c28a0473b2809","5e7092d6878c28a04739db8c","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1217","5e7092d6878c28a04739db87","67765600fdbe833e69505fb5","67765600fdbe833e69505fb6","67765600fdbe833e69505fb7","5e70947f878c28a0473be651"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547758f","mniswId":"3392","title":"CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES","doi":"10.1007/18.1420-9071","issn":"1420-682X","documentHash":"bc4a025c-4060-474d-add8-078e33e4cf3d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Obesity","Endometrium","Decidua","Implantation","Placenta","Leptin","SOCS3","PTPN2","STAT3"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060375457"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6776471afdbe833e694f9025","name":"Marcus","lastName":"Schmidt","documentHash":"718f0433-5a70-413d-8ca8-61e8fe68279b"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abe58","name":"Marianna","lastName":"Raczyk","uuid":"4E6B8B3B90D319B12E796C867B1D250822A65D1C8B591B3802497228EF86D260DDD43556A83C78652F9EA1D2B5BF9BAFF8E300770ADAB19FD406AF05F79FB259","orcidId":"0000-0002-2758-3408","documentHash":"d51bfac5-6d62-45b1-b67f-c2bfc246e0cf"}],"objectId":"6776471afdbe833e694f9024","doi":"10.1080/10408398.2023.2195026","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85151357980&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"FODMAP reduction strategies for nutritionally valuable baking products: current state and future challenges","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) comprise several previously unrelated carbohydrates, such as fructans, fructo-oligosaccharides, galacto-oligosaccharides, fructose (in excess of glucose), mannitol and sorbitol, and among others. For many patients with gastro-intestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, the ingestion of FODMAP triggers symptoms and causes discomfort. Among the main contributors to the dietary FODMAP intake are baking products, in particular bread as a major global staple food. This is primarily due to the fructan content of the cereal flours, but also process induced accumulation of FODMAP is possible. To provide low-FODMAP baking products, researchers have investigated various approaches, such as bio-process reduction by yeast, lactic acid bacteria, germination of the raw material or the use of exogenous enzymes. In addition, the selection of appropriate ingredients, which are either naturally or after pretreatment suitable for low-FODMAP products, is discussed. The sensory and nutritional quality of low-FODMAP baking products is another issue, that is addressed, with particular focus on providing sufficient dietary fiber intake. Based on this information, the current state of low-FODMAP baking and future research necessities, to establish practical strategies for low-FODMAP products, are evaluated in this article."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709386878c28a0473abe58"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"64","pagesFromTo":"8036-8053","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6776471afdbe833e694f9025","5e709386878c28a0473abe58"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547782e","mniswId":"4519","title":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","issn":"1040-8398","documentHash":"1739f07e-c24a-4110-bba6-49727605d8c4"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bioprocessing","cereals","dietary fiber","fructan","product quality","technological approaches"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060375787"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67765dd6fdbe833e6950b5c1","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Krejszeff","documentHash":"21abc084-0709-4462-a1de-29db3231e81c"},{"objectId":"67765dd6fdbe833e6950b5c0","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Hliwa","documentHash":"adcd5d3a-e105-4f58-9a11-659618e1417e"},{"objectId":"67765dd6fdbe833e6950b5bf","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Błażejewski","documentHash":"c7c8d96b-4f33-44ee-86a1-31c62c20384c"},{"objectId":"67765dd6fdbe833e6950b5be","name":"Jan P.","lastName":"Jastrzębski","documentHash":"b1bb5d8f-2791-47c1-a982-f0b9914ee8f9"},{"objectId":"67765dd6fdbe833e6950b5bd","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Jarmołowicz","documentHash":"a3f7161a-85bb-4408-b24e-f277fc164684"},{"objectId":"67765dd6fdbe833e6950b5bc","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Palińska-Żarska","documentHash":"913113b6-4395-478c-9aca-459bd0ba7683"},{"objectId":"6340e0aa7523402e34103fb2","name":"Taina","lastName":"Rocha De Almeida","uuid":"C74A7E80798A81E88BC6F05A5827495202160682223E3720A8AF7C5F07F3D68910D42A4380ED51AAD1B02C794F602061224C93DDF93589C227BD8725EE4BAEB5","documentHash":"a3ff9fce-19f2-47fd-884f-c52c4b3a1709"},{"objectId":"617a0b297523400564d4b501","name":"Abhipsa","lastName":"Panda","uuid":"BBFBA9FEBD8BAC67A3E2F5A0A3623F2620A339F8DCF2BA8F66BAEC8E6921A5AFCB015B00628E6D6CA14BF53B9B76D437110F30869A4409B6AE50FC040FCDECF6","documentHash":"d689d10e-81da-417f-8d4f-bf35f8903eac"},{"objectId":"617a0b297523400564d4b482","name":"Rossella","lastName":"Debernardis","uuid":"B65806CD423F9428990ED52C58DD66C4579C59665C962B04E6F613849D338560D49937699DCE3F91AC286DF5855765D1773B8DFFF9BD923D7602E195EE8D9185","documentHash":"f2c5ab43-228d-4ebf-983e-6815f2d448f8"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Judycka","uuid":"1BC4BF9E119F09531BF37A15CAB0B8930B3CEAD1AF40343466114BF77590C3D83197AC72C68511FBF2141C1C8BA5A439D9C46314ACF0CF765BCFB4F5151DB784","documentHash":"4562af07-7167-4f8c-8263-56fca5431f8e"},{"objectId":"5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Żarski","uuid":"C79A8111D2D012910483FF5D04C579E9FE114BBBFDBA5CB7C07AD1BEF561D1BD73734995AC49C0CF23B9AA29ACAE919DB99FD8CDFA546404CB973C5E79C1ADB2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3082-9250","documentHash":"720051ea-3868-48ad-9aab-29755a850bd5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67765dd6fdbe833e6950b5bb","doi":"10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741486","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Does transcriptome of freshly hatched fish larvae describe past or predict future developmental trajectory?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Transcriptomic analysis of freshly hatched fish larvae offers insights into phenotype development, yet it remains uncertain whether it reflects parental influence or predicts individual growth. This research scrutinizes the transcriptome of 16 Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) larval families (at mouth opening stage, coinciding in this species with hatching) alongside pre- and post-hatching zootechnical traits. Despite consistent fertilization rates, significant variations in embryonic development and larval performance highlight diverse phenotypes studied. It enabled us to bring our attention to the fact that transcriptome of larvae at mouth opening stage can serve as a window into both the parental contributions and the future performance of the larvae. Our analysis shed light on ribosome biogenesis, neurogenesis, and the cell cycle, as important processes shaping early larval performance. Additionally, we propose a set of predictive, validated gene markers associated with further larval performance and key aquaculture traits, such as selenoo (associated with cannibalism), trim16 (fulton's condition factor), slc15a1 (specific growth factor), and cipc (final weight). This study delves into the descriptive and predictive nature of the transcriptomic portrait of newly hatched larvae, paving the way to comprehend the intricate developmental pathways from fertilization towards juvenile stage."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6340e0aa7523402e34103fb2","617a0b297523400564d4b482","5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90","617a0b297523400564d4b501","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"595","pagesFromTo":"art. no 741486 (1-15)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["617a0b297523400564d4b482","67765dd6fdbe833e6950b5bc","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2","617a0b297523400564d4b501","67765dd6fdbe833e6950b5bd","67765dd6fdbe833e6950b5be","6340e0aa7523402e34103fb2","67765dd6fdbe833e6950b5bf","67765dd6fdbe833e6950b5c0","67765dd6fdbe833e6950b5c1","5e70942e878c28a0473b7b90"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547715a","mniswId":"1539","title":"Aquaculture","issn":"0044-8486","eissn":"1873-5622","documentHash":"aaff1260-3172-4786-b919-d851b47a7a44"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Eurasian perch larvae","Pre-hatching traits","Post-hatching traits","WGCNA","RNA-seq"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060375844"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67765210fdbe833e69502651","name":"Eunike","lastName":"Velleuer","documentHash":"57a8f0c1-c3dd-4bb6-9770-12577ff5af33"},{"objectId":"6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","name":"Carsten","lastName":"Carlberg","uuid":"7A3E0E7963E1192270F3903EEFFAA1A086E27754D1B393FD104F68B8A691171F30A075FDFF073A66B06C35CCE685244FF4287E47226B5FB73CCE42A85608CA83","documentHash":"50649f30-9531-42e7-8c6c-543c2bbfecb8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-07-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67765210fdbe833e69502650","doi":"10.3390/nu16142271","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85199542504&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A nutrigenomic view on the premature-aging disease Fanconi anemia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fanconi anemia, a rare disorder with an incidence of 1 in 300,000, is caused by mutations in FANC genes, which affect the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks. The disease is characterized by congenital malformations, bone marrow failure within the first decade of life, and recurrent squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, esophagus, and anogenital regions starting around age 20. In this review, we propose that Fanconi anemia should be considered a premature-aging syndrome. Interestingly, the onset and severity of the life-limiting clinical features of Fanconi anemia can be influenced by lifestyle choices, such as a healthy diet and physical activity. These factors shape the epigenetic status of at-risk cell types and enhance the competence of the immune system through nutritional signaling. Fanconi anemia may serve as a model for understanding the aging process in the general population, addressing research gaps in its clinical presentation and suggesting prevention strategies. Additionally, we will discuss how the balance of genetic and environmental risk factors—affecting both cancer onset and the speed of aging—is interlinked with signal transduction by dietary molecules. The underlying nutrigenomic principles will offer guidance for healthy aging in individuals with Fanconi anemia as well as for the general population."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności

organic compounds (VOCs) in buckwheat flour fermented for 24 h by different Lactobacillus strains was the topic of this study. The head-space microextraction (HS-SPME) with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was implemented to qualify and quantified the VOCs. Thereby, samples fermented by L. rhamnosus GG showed the highest number of detected VOCs. Aldehydes were noticed to be the largest class of chemicals determined in fermented buckwheat flour. Then a significant number of ketones and alcohols was also determined. The content of identified VOCs was observed to be strain- and time-dependent. What is more, hexanal and acetic acid were the most abundant compounds in all samples. According to this study, it can be concluded that the usage of 4–12 h of lactic acid fermentation allows for the formation of a significant portfolio of volatile molecules, and therefore their relatively high content can increase the potential aroma attractiveness of buckwheat-based products."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej

The extracts were also tested regarding polyphenol profile and Lascorbic acid content (UHPLC-DAD-MS), and antioxidant capacity (DPPH, ABTS). ‘Scarlet September Kiwi’ showed the strongest anti-AGEs activity studied with BSAGLU (IC50 = 2.68) and BSA-MGO (IC50 = 18.06) models. The highest anti-AChE activity was found for the ‘Lande’ extract (IC50 = 4.56). ‘Lande’ showed the highest L-ascorbic acid content (8271.96 µg/g dw), ABTS (312.42 µmol TE/g dw) and DPPH (282.01 µmol TE/g dw) values. 'Scarlet September Kiwi' revealed the highest individual phenolics concentration (2321.43 µg/g dw). The contents of (+)-catechin and L-ascorbic acid were significantly correlated with anti-AChE activity. This research sheds new light on the bioactivity of Actinidia arguta and Actinidia kolomikta fruit elucidating the role of (+)-catechin and L-ascorbic acid in prevention of Alzheimer’s

Powder of Raspberry Pomace as a Source of Bioactive Compounds","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Red raspberries, which contain a variety of nutrients and phytochemicals that are beneficial for human health, can be utilized as a raw material in the creation of several supplements. This research suggests micronized powder of raspberry pomace production. The molecular characteristics (FTIR), sugar, and biological potential (phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity) of micronized raspberry powders were investigated. FTIR spectroscopy results revealed spectral changes in the ranges with maxima at ~1720, 1635, and 1326, as well as intensity changes in practically the entire spectral range analyzed. The discrepancies clearly indicate that the micronization of the raspberry byproduct samples cleaved the intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the polysaccharides present in the samples, thus increasing the respective content of simple saccharides. In comparison to the control powders, more glucose and fructose were recovered from the micronized samples of the raspberry powders. The study’s micronized powders were found to contain nine different types of phenolic compounds, including rutin, elagic acid derivatives, cyanidin-3-sophoroside, cyanidin-3-(2-glucosylrutinoside), cyanidin-3-rutinoside, pelargonidin-3-rutinoside, and elagic acid derivatives. Significantly higher concentrations of ellagic acid and ellagic acid derivatives and rutin were found in the micronized samples than in the control sample. The antioxidant potential assessed by ABTS and FRAP significantly increased following the micronization procedure. © 2023 by the authors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","uid":"bc8mEkzUvIyODmqQ0WYOUYA","uuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Uniwersytet Marii Curie-Skłodowskiej w Lublinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709227878c28a047390af3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709442878c28a0473b910b","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","issue":"12","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663414b14097076263f799ba","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","5e709442878c28a0473b910b","663414b14097076263f799bc","663414b14097076263f799bd","663414b14097076263f799be","663414b14097076263f799bf","663414b14097076263f799c0","5e709227878c28a047390af3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060399629"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e4d85fdbe8322e23b90bd","name":"Adriana","lastName":"Slavova-Kazakova","documentHash":"e8b8aba9-7123-4486-b456-2dce27c9a037"},{"objectId":"676e4d85fdbe8322e23b90bc","name":"Petko","lastName":"Denev","documentHash":"d62e41f2-2809-4142-9f39-0fee188ad45f"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c1204","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Sulewska","uuid":"05EB949174E6B29574DD48DAEAAAB5139F44212AE29E99A70883B7472E33B3462D2799BF4A6282DDEE3018002AF9DBA41AD9B97B7B8ABE09DEE5EA9ECB6FBDC4","documentHash":"c0c8648d-8fee-4894-bb71-f39a2dd6ed56"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b910b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Janiak","uuid":"ED89E67B99A387674B4297A18C3C3CD8AA8413DFBA0D90FADF253FA46010EC54CE3537CDB7CD5E3A22D8F73EACE2151361A73BC32B454350089D09ED3167E4D5","documentHash":"21519e0f-0512-44de-95f6-c1ff5f5d7037"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59e7","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Karamać","uuid":"EA8089F94A8D72605CF49B5A6CE075DB78DBC5FEEB3347DA87E1C34DFF188480B746E4D91ED4BCEA493D67CB34229C7B3C4423C7019602EAF7F0FCC10A661CB9","documentHash":"1f0b8053-1703-4d7c-94cc-8213a343b75a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e4d85fdbe8322e23b90bb","doi":"10.3390/pr11113205","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85178352898&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Phenolic Profile and Antioxidant Potential of Beverages from Buckwheat and Side Streams after Beverages Production","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Plant-based milk alternatives are a fast-growing segment of food industry resulting in the generation of large amounts of by-products, often containing comparable and even higher amounts of valuable phytochemicals than the target products. Common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum M.) Panda variety has been selected for this study, which aims to compare the antioxidant potential of beverages produced from buckwheat whole and dehulled grains, as well as cakes obtained as residues. After combining, evaporating and freeze-drying, extracts were subjected to RP-HPLC-DAD, total phenolics and in vitro antiradical and antioxidant assays (FRAP, ABTS, DPPH and lipid autoxidation). Flavonoids (3.09 mg/100 mL) exceeded the content of phenolic acids (2.35 mg/100 mL) in the beverages prepared from dehulled grains, but their content (1.69 mg/100 mL) in the beverages from whole grains was lower than that of phenolic acids (2.93 mg/100 mL).

Since the myeloid linage of hematopoiesis is epigenetically programmed by VDR in concert with the pioneer factors PU.1 (purine-rich box 1) and CEBPα (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α), monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells are the most vitamin D-sensitive immune cell types. The central role of the immune system in various aging-related diseases suggests that immunocompetence describes not only the ability of an individual to resist pathogens and parasites but also to contest non-communicative diseases and the process of aging itself. In this review, we argue that the individual-specific responsiveness to vitamin D relates to a person’s immunocompetence via the epigenetic programming function of VDR and its ligand 1,25(OH)2D3 during hematopoiesis as well as in the periphery. This may provide a mechanism explaining how vitamin D protects against major common diseases and, in parallel, promotes healthy aging."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"art. no 398 (1-12)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","67726bc4fdbe831015c5f786"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","issn":"2072-6643","documentHash":"c19e39d9-34f9-43a7-9c35-a6b3e3ec2726"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aging","epigenome","hematopoiesis","immunocompetence","innate immunity","transcriptome","vitamin D","vitamin D target genes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060410241"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e5773fdbe8322e23ba5a6","name":"Fatih","lastName":"Oz","documentHash":"735a6a35-88eb-41a4-bd2e-9169ab172a39"},{"objectId":"676e5773fdbe8322e23ba5a5","name":"Charles","lastName":"Brennan","documentHash":"7456ed1d-fd2d-476d-87e7-1685e2bdcef7"},{"objectId":"676e5773fdbe8322e23ba5a4","name":"Fidel","lastName":"Toldra","documentHash":"50d1632a-d9bb-4b9f-bf3e-aa10f35908ad"},{"objectId":"676e5773fdbe8322e23ba5a3","name":"Sadettin","lastName":"Turhan","documentHash":"d8fc0dde-eb07-46bb-b6c2-ae41ae508fc9"},{"objectId":"676e5773fdbe8322e23ba5a2","name":"Emel","lastName":"Oz","documentHash":"14b1a63a-ffca-4173-b724-03f4f7bf643d"},{"objectId":"676e5773fdbe8322e23ba5a1","name":"Sare","lastName":"Kilic","documentHash":"c672f25e-3eff-424a-8c7f-db4cbcc2a3bf"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e5773fdbe8322e23ba5a0","doi":"10.1111/ijfs.16590","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85165592583&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The effect of sealing process on the textural and sensory properties and protein profile of cooked meat","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This work aimed to determine the effect of sealing process at different internal temperatures on the cooking loss, lipid oxidation, textural, and sensory properties, as well as the protein profile of cooked meat. For this aim, four different groups were formed. The control group was not sealed, while the other three groups were sealed until their internal temperature reached 20, 30, and 40 °C. Then, all samples were baked until their internal endpoint temperature reached 71 °C to ensure food safety. The lowest cooking loss (11.57%) was detected in the control group, and increased sealing core temperature resulted in an increase in cooking loss. The sealing did not show a significant effect (P > 0.05) on the TBARS value. On the other hand, myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic protein profile were influenced by sealing. Myofibrillar protein profile showed that protein denaturation rate was higher in groups sealed at the internal temperature of 30 and 40 °C. The sealing process affected only the hardness value among the textural properties examined. With the sealing process, the hardness value of the meat significantly (P < 0.05) reduced and the lowest hardness value was determined in the sample sealed at the internal temperature of 20 °C. Sealing positively affected the overall acceptability score of the samples, and the samples sealed until their internal temperatures reached 30 and 40 °C had higher overall acceptability scores. © 2023 The Authors.

Thus, the ability to quickly and accurately measure HSA levels is important for the rapid identification of these disorders in human populations. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), well known as artificial antibodies (Abs), have been extensively used for the quantitative detection of small molecules and macromolecules, especially HSA, in recent decades. This review highlights major challenges and recent developments in the application of MIPs to detect HSA in artificial and real samples.

Moreover, breeders are interested in the possibility of using milt from fish that have died during the spawning season. This study aimed to investigate the possibility of revitalising rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) sperm with the use of short-term storage of undiluted and diluted semen samples collected from the fish post-mortem. We found that the pH decreased rapidly in the semen within 8 h of the fish's death, while lactic acid concentration increased simultaneously. We found that nearly immotile rainbow trout sperm collected from the fish body 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after its death regained their motility as a result of short-term storage. In the samples taken 10 h after the fish's death, sperm revitalisation was significantly lower compared to the samples taken 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after the death of the fish. After this time, only samples diluted with artificial seminal plasma (ASP) were able to regain about 20% motility. Completely recovered motility was observed when the semen was collected within 2 h after the fish's death and the samples were diluted in an ASP solution. Our in vitro study showed that sperm exposed only to low pH (7.5) did not decrease their motility within hours, as it was observed in vivo. We found that the addition of different lactic acid concentrations to semen samples in ASP with low pH (7.5) caused a significant and rapid decrease in sperm motility, which is reversible, however, only when not more than a 10 mM concentration of lactic acid was used. In conclusion, we believe that the combined effect of pH and lactic acid accumulated in the gonads after the fish's death may be responsible for the permanent immobilisation of rainbow trout sperm."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c11d8","5e709410878c28a0473b59ea","5e709410878c28a0473b5a3e","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2","60bedaea9543c7233654326a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"581","pagesFromTo":"art. no 740425 (1-8)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60bedaea9543c7233654326a","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11d8","67726a85fdbe831015c5eb6f","5e709410878c28a0473b59ea","5e709410878c28a0473b5a3e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547715a","mniswId":"1539","title":"Aquaculture","issn":"0044-8486","eissn":"1873-5622","documentHash":"aaff1260-3172-4786-b919-d851b47a7a44"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Artificial seminal plasma","Lactic acid effect","Low pH effect","Rainbow trout","Short-term storage","Sperm revitalisation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060410321"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61d510b87523401fc110f972","name":"Sinith Rashmin","lastName":"Withanage","uuid":"BB8F3BC78B3740EB2D32E99925485A608C8FCA241B323C9000AC8814A559DBACD835E920969813D92F41FDFD905D8FA91BBE174D56334D1C44740C4AC1C2FD22","documentHash":"4f031b72-b04b-4b49-b4f8-1b840594843c"},{"objectId":"5e7094b3878c28a0473c1df3","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kowacz","uuid":"E53E9875396BEEED9291BD0D53FE6CCBDF214374BF249850F3E9A84DD949BCFB057F6F5A63DE42450C1C4EE46B539508EED2C09E9BF12DA177FC62724D4684D5","documentHash":"03d56860-f8c0-4642-99f5-546a4de878e4"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db74","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Niestępski","uuid":"A548A904F1FFB01EE0FA581389ED399BD66C5A98E3AC0F3B89A62C29BC989F2D02FA02F779174C742A6C42E2F524E80A8B6DAAD06E0951D6C140F4F6A997473E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3524-821X","documentHash":"8e849844-8f0f-4dc9-b396-16b172cf0e19"}],"objectId":"676e5c89fdbe8322e23bab07","doi":"10.1039/d3sm00889d","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85173586465&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Voltage and concentration gradients across membraneless interface generated next to hydrogels: relation to glycocalyx","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Next to many hydrophilic surfaces, including those of biological cells and tissues, a layer of water that effectively excludes solutes and particles can be generated. This interfacial water is the subject of research aiming for practical applications such as removal of salts, pathogens or manipulation of biomolecules. However, the exact mechanism of its creation is still elusive because its persistence and extension contradict hydrogen-bond dynamics and electric double layer predictions. The experimentally recorded negative voltage of this interfacial water remains to be properly explained. Even less is known about the nature of such water layers in biological systems. We present experimental evidence for ion and particle exclusion as a result of separation of ionic charges with distinct diffusion rates across a liquid junction at the gel/water interface and the subsequent repulsion of ions of a given sign by a like-charged gel surface. Gels represent features of biological interfaces (in terms of functional groups and porosity) and are subject to biologically relevant chemical triggers. Our results show that gels with -OSO3− and -COO− groups can effectively generate ion- and particle-depleted regions of water reaching over 100 μm and having negative voltage up to −30 mV. Exclusion distance and electric potential depend on the liquid junction potential at the gel/water interface and on the concentration gradient at the depleted region/bulk interface, respectively. The voltage and extension of these ion- and particle-depleted water layers can be effectively modified by CO2 (respiratory gas) or KH2PO4 (cell metabolite).

In wounded skin, the transcription factor Foxn1 interacting with hypoxia-regulated factors affects re-epithelialization, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT) reestablishment and is thus a factor regulating scar-forming/reparative healing. Here, we hypothesized that transcriptional crosstalk between Foxn1 and Hif-1α controls the switch from scarless (regenerative) to scar-present (reparative) skin wound healing. To verify this hypothesis, we examined (i) the effect of hypoxia/normoxia and Foxn1 signalling on the proteomic signature of Foxn1−/− (regenerative) dermal fibroblasts (DFs) and then (ii) explored the effect of Hif-1α or Foxn1/Hif-1α introduced by a lentiviral (LV) delivery vector to injured skin of regenerative Foxn1−/− mice with particular attention to the remodelling phase of healing. RESULTS: We showed that hypoxic conditions and Foxn1 stimulation modified the proteome of Foxn1−/− DFs. Hypoxic conditions upregulated DF protein profiles, particularly those related to extracellular matrix (ECM) composition: plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (Pai-1), Sdc4, Plod2, Plod1, Lox, Loxl2, Itga2, Vldlr, Ftl1, Vegfa, Hmox1, Fth1, and F3. We found that Pai-1 was stimulated by hypoxic conditions in regenerative Foxn1−/− DFs but was released by DFs to the culture media exclusively upon hypoxia and Foxn1 stimulation. We also found higher levels of Pai-1 protein in DFs isolated from Foxn1+/+ mice (reparative/scar-forming) than in DFs isolated from Foxn1−/− (regenerative/scarless) mice and triggered by injury increase in Foxn1 and Pai-1 protein in the skin of mice with active Foxn1 (Foxn1+/+ mice). Then, we demonstrated that the introduction of Foxn1 and Hif-1α via lentiviral injection into the wounded skin of regenerative Foxn1−/− mice activates reparative/scar-forming healing by increasing the wounded skin area and decreasing hyaluronic acid deposition and the collagen type III to I ratio. We also identified a stimulatory effect of LV-Foxn1 + LV-Hif-1α injection in the wounded skin of Foxn1−/− mice on Pai-1 protein levels. CONLUSIONS: The present data highlight the effect of hypoxia and Foxn1 on the protein profile and functionality of regenerative Foxn1−/− DFs and demonstrate that the introduction of Foxn1 and Hif-1α into the wounded skin of regenerative Foxn1−/− mice activates reparative/scar-forming healing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c1218","5e70938d878c28a0473aca68","5e7093e1878c28a0473b27f7","5e709419878c28a0473b63ac","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"art. no 193 (1-28)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709419878c28a0473b63ac","5e7093e1878c28a0473b27f7","5e70938d878c28a0473aca68","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1218","67727ec2fdbe831015c80483","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773bf","mniswId":"2600","title":"BMC BIOLOGY","issn":"1741-7007","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"ef49be0b-d338-4737-bc97-3034f491f2da"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Hypoxia","Foxn1","Pai-1","Skin wound healing","Dermal fbroblasts","Regeneration"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060410344"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67690810fdbe834b5155e492","name":"Lekhmici","lastName":"Arrar","documentHash":"13edb941-d3b9-4859-a93d-f3eebb446b09"},{"objectId":"67690810fdbe834b5155e490","name":"Djamel E.","lastName":"Kati","documentHash":"f5b684de-e1e1-4a6d-8739-5fe7881c0850"},{"objectId":"67690810fdbe834b5155e48e","name":"Thoraya","lastName":"Guemmaz","documentHash":"28066c47-6c5b-407e-a441-2ec10a17a7ee"},{"objectId":"67690810fdbe834b5155e48d","name":"Katia","lastName":"Abdelouhab","documentHash":"22536ba6-bbc4-4ae6-8f5a-1bb6b8cdcc28"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59e7","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Karamać","uuid":"EA8089F94A8D72605CF49B5A6CE075DB78DBC5FEEB3347DA87E1C34DFF188480B746E4D91ED4BCEA493D67CB34229C7B3C4423C7019602EAF7F0FCC10A661CB9","documentHash":"1f0b8053-1703-4d7c-94cc-8213a343b75a"}],"objectId":"67690810fdbe834b5155e48c","doi":"10.1016/j.jpba.2023.115673","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85169577279&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Phenolic composition and correlation with antioxidant properties of various organic fractions from Hertia cheirifolia extracts","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hertia cheirifolia L. is a medicinal plant that has been used for a long time in folk Mediterranean medicine. The aim of the present study was to analyze and compare the phenolic profile and the antioxidant potential of organic fractions from H. cheirifolia extracts. Crude methanolic extracts were firstly prepared from the different parts of the plant. Then four different organic fractions were obtained by fractioning each extract, using different solvents with increasing polarity (hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate). The Phenolic content was analyzed using a UV–Vis colorimetric methods followed by a qualitative and quantitative analysis by high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) system. After that, the antioxidant potential of the different organic fractions was evaluated using DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging assays, reducing power of iron (FRAP) and inhibition of β-carotene oxidation tests. Our results revealed that ethyl acetate fractions (EA) contained the highest content of total phenolics (100–250 mg GAE/g). Indeed, the ethyl acetate fraction from the flower extract (EA-F) displayed the lowest IC50 values for the scavenging of DPPH and ABTS free radicals (38.83 ± 0.34 µg/ml and 23.76 ± 0.11 µg/ml, respectively). Also, the strongest iron reducing power (2628.87 ± 16.47 µmol Fe2+Eq/ml) and the best rate of inhibition of the β-carotene oxidation (58.91 ± 5.79 %) were recorded. In sum, the present study suggests that, the organic fractions from H. cherifolia are potential natural antioxidants and this is probably related to their phenolics content and structure. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b59e7","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"235","pagesFromTo":"art. no 115673 (1-xx)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67690810fdbe834b5155e48d","67690810fdbe834b5155e48e","5e709410878c28a0473b59e7","67690810fdbe834b5155e490","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","67690810fdbe834b5155e492"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e724af2467f01e930878ff","title":"Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis","issn":"1573-904x","documentHash":"2401ad24-e1df-4274-b18f-0be2ae0857e0"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Antioxidant activity","Hertia cheirifolia","HPLC-DAD","Organic fraction","Polyphenol"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060410369"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f72","name":"Dinesh","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"c6940edb-b9b3-4a01-8a59-6d65b464b13d"},{"objectId":"67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f71","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Kuca","documentHash":"1ce91710-5884-4212-8921-bd8984f98459"},{"objectId":"67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f70","name":"Martin","lastName":"Valis","documentHash":"b525bb2d-9324-4f1e-b172-d8625dd1e996"},{"objectId":"67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f6f","name":"Ajay K.","lastName":"Gautam","documentHash":"ce1ba5b3-bf4f-44f0-9880-cfaceaf9e293"},{"objectId":"67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f6e","name":"Vedpriya","lastName":"Arya","documentHash":"502c1505-70bd-44aa-b35d-875b3727efb7"},{"objectId":"67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f6d","name":"Ashwani","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"40822282-79ae-42cf-a676-544dd8783308"},{"objectId":"67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f6c","name":"Sugandh","lastName":"Sinha","documentHash":"02c172b5-d0e4-4707-8b97-2fae93f0c520"},{"objectId":"67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f6b","name":"Acharya","lastName":"Balkrishna","documentHash":"5ec80c03-31d6-475f-bc22-78a6ec31468f"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f6a","doi":"10.1016/j.biopha.2023.115183","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85165582005&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Sepsis-mediated renal dysfunction: Pathophysiology, biomarkers and role of phytoconstituents in its management","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Sepsis has evolved as an enormous health issue amongst critically ill patients.

The pathogenesis of sepsis-mediated AKI entails a complicated mechanism and is likely to involve a distinct constellation of hemodynamic, inflammatory, and immune mechanisms. Novel biomarkers like neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1, procalcitonin, alpha-1-microglobulin, and presepsin can help in a more sensitive diagnosis of sepsis-associated AKI. Many bioactive compounds like curcumin, resveratrol, baicalin, quercetin, and polydatin are reported to play an important role in the prevention and management of sepsis-associated AKI by decreasing serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, cystatin C, lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, IL-1β, TNF-α, NF-κB, and increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes and level of PPARγ. The plant bioactive compounds could be developed into a drug-developing candidate in managing sepsis-mediated acute kidney injury after detailed follow-up studies. Lastly, the gut-kidney axis may be a more promising therapeutic target against the onset of septic AKI, but a deeper understanding of the molecular pathways is still required. © 2023 The Authors"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"165","pagesFromTo":"art. no 115183 (1-17)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f6b","67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f6c","67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f6d","67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f6e","67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f6f","67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f70","67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f71","67694b88fdbe8317b9a16f72","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff721ad49b31ccec49766","title":"Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy","issn":"0753-3322","eissn":"1950-6007","documentHash":"c8a281f4-7495-40dd-b72b-c9f88189272f"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Acute kidney injury","Biomarkers","Gut-kidney axis","Plant bioactive compounds","Pyroptosis","Sepsis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060410372"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e4787fdbe8322e23b8492","name":"Sumit","lastName":"Singh","documentHash":"8bac7475-9f5a-4fed-9e82-446b5d3eb219"},{"objectId":"676e4787fdbe8322e23b8491","name":"Humaira","lastName":"Qadri","documentHash":"932666b6-4978-4e6c-9f3b-db4ae2046a5e"},{"objectId":"676e4787fdbe8322e23b8490","name":"Fuad","lastName":"Ameen","documentHash":"f9f6905d-f2d6-486f-bfa6-bb600e681530"},{"objectId":"676e4787fdbe8322e23b848f","name":"Sartaj Ahmad","lastName":"Bhat","documentHash":"5ded6469-0e15-4ea6-a277-4744607cabf4"},{"objectId":"676e4787fdbe8322e23b848e","name":"Jatinder Mohan","lastName":"Julka","documentHash":"5e35568b-3317-4507-9458-92b58f622876"},{"objectId":"676e4787fdbe8322e23b848d","name":"Ankeet","lastName":"Bhagat","documentHash":"35a2fc38-a099-4a36-bae8-243f5d56a316"},{"objectId":"676e4787fdbe8322e23b848c","name":"Vineet","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"57dbca28-7453-441e-96a6-0e71f69ef4f6"},{"objectId":"676e4787fdbe8322e23b848b","name":"Kasahun","lastName":"Gudeta","documentHash":"c2bb1c1a-f5b6-480a-bc19-c131ff89db83"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-03-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e4787fdbe8322e23b848a","doi":"10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e14572","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85150423312&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Ecological adaptation of earthworms for coping with plant polyphenols, heavy metals, and microplastics in the soil: A review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In recent years, soil pollution by massive accumulation of heavy metals (HMs), microplastics, and refractory hydrocarbon chemicals has become an emerging and global concern, drawing worldwide attention. These pollutants influence soil diversity by hindering the reproduction, abundance, thereby affecting aboveground productivity. The scientific community has recently emphasized the contribution of earthworms to heavy metal accumulation, microplastic degradation, and the decomposition of organic matter in the soil, which helps maintain the soil structure. This review paper aimed to compile scientific facts on how earthworms cope with the effect of HMs, microplastics, and plant polyphenols so that vermiremediation could be widely applied for well-being of the soil ecosystem by environmentalists. Earthworms have special surface-active metabolites in their guts called drilodefensins that help them defend themselves against the oxidative action of plant polyphenols. They also combat the effects of toxic microplastics, and other oxidative compounds by elevating the antioxidant activities of their enzymes and converting them into harmless compounds or useful nutrients. Moreover, earthworms also act as biofilters, bioindicators, bioaccumulators, and transformers of oxidative polyphenols, microplastics, toxic HMs, and other pollutant hydrocarbons. Microorganisms (fungi and bacteria) in earthworms' gut of also assist in the fixation, accumulation, and transformation of these toxicants to prevent their effects. As a potential organism for application in ecotoxicology, it is recommended to propagate earthworms in agricultural fields; isolate, and culture enormously in industry, and inoculate earthworms in the polluted soil, thereby abate toxicity and minimizing the health effect caused by these pollutants as well enhance the productivity of crops."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"art. no e14572 (1-13)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676e4787fdbe8322e23b848b","676e4787fdbe8322e23b848c","676e4787fdbe8322e23b848d","676e4787fdbe8322e23b848e","676e4787fdbe8322e23b848f","676e4787fdbe8322e23b8490","676e4787fdbe8322e23b8491","676e4787fdbe8322e23b8492","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c2a4","mniswId":"7504","title":"Heliyon","issn":"2405-8440","eissn":"2405-8440","documentHash":"05fb320b-04d9-493e-b63d-0bccbe96db8d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Antioxidants","Drilodefensin","Earthworms","Gut microbes","Metallothioneins","Pollutants"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060410383"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70945e878c28a0473bb8b8","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Mostek-Majewska","uuid":"C045439502DC72C42C5CE54A3DFC35E19B53E70D6AEAE34FD25EF617016ABE7A3FEA2AF861B3D0BF2CA76488DADB955A18BFE2286D4B88FA09654CBD04D51FB3","documentHash":"f48cb97d-282d-4f2d-be59-7c974a888f9e"},{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b9457","name":"Anna","lastName":"Majewska","uuid":"5E5542061219242AC69D0292D4AB33EBD6C7C91ECD3AAE39934D161E67CBD4D94F333A7B57163376796806F387A09D8E9F79DDBDBD3E65A868CAEBD36CAF3624","documentHash":"a375766b-96a5-45e4-adfc-56ac5cedd696"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Ciereszko","uuid":"8DDAA077AF44261DCF0520E5A544DC624790613E97D31A6E69866CA47B0BE48CA68261CB972862072612A15E8601DFB12A75BC79EB268AE20BF6FDE46BBDCFD3","documentHash":"4ffd62ff-6e05-41ff-9258-58db72ae7b17"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fc41","name":"Anna","lastName":"Janta","uuid":"C0C0E1601BDA01F32C2828C1CFA5B02B3831980372D1699A13862C00AF4B0597363299ADFFC97897AAE62ED678B75D02CBFE4AD69569B55D0DDA38CA34E40EED","documentHash":"b1879658-c651-4a7f-a0a2-f87b4a145ab4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e693afdbe8322e23bd0ba","doi":"10.1186/s12964-023-01080-w","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85152352131&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"New insights into posttranslational modifications of proteins during bull sperm capacitation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BACKGROUND: Due to the unique nature of spermatozoa, which are transcriptionally and translationally silent, the regulation of capacitation is based on the formation of posttranslational modifications of proteins (PTMs). However, the interactions between different types of PTMs during the capacitation remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to unravel the PTM-based regulation of sperm capacitation by considering the relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation and reversible oxidative PTMs (oxPTMs), i.e., S-nitrosylation and S-glutathionylation. Since reversible oxPTMs may be closely related to peroxyredoxin (PRDX) activity, the second aim was to verify the role of PRDXs in the PTM-based regulation of capacitation. METHODS: Cryopreserved bull sperm were capacitated in vitro with or without PRDX inhibitor. Qualitative parameters of sperm and symptoms characteristic of capacitation were analyzed. Posttranslational protein modifications (S-nitrosylation, S-glutathionylation, tyrosine phosphorylation) were investigated at the cellular level (flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy) and at the proteomic level (fluorescent gel-based proteomic approach). RESULTS: Zona-pellucida binding proteins (ACRBP, SPAM1, ZAN, ZPBP1 and IZUMO4) were particularly rich in reversible oxPTMs. Moreover, numerous flagellar proteins were associated with all analyzed types of PTMs, which indicates that the direction of posttranslational modifications was integrated. Inhibition of PRDX activity during capacitation caused an increase in S-nitrosylation and S-glutathionylation and a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation. Inhibition of PRDXs caused GAPDHS to undergo S-glutathionylation and the GSTO2 and SOD2 enzymes to undergo denitrosylation. Moreover, PRDX inhibition caused the AKAP proteins to be dephosphorylated. CONCLUSIONS: Our research provides evidence that crosstalk occurs between tyrosine phosphorylation and reversible oxPTMs during bull sperm capacitation. This study demonstrates that capacitation triggers S-nitrosylation and S-glutathionylation (and reverse reactions) of zona-pellucida binding proteins, which may be a new important mechanism that determines the interaction between sperms and oocytes. Moreover, TCA-related and flagellar proteins, which are particularly rich in PTMs, may play a key role in sperm capacitation. We propose that the deglutathionylation of ODFs and IZUMO4 proteins is a new hallmark of bull sperm capacitation. The obtained results indicate a relationship between PRDX activity and protein phosphorylation, S-glutathionylation and S-nitrosylation. The activity of PRDXs may be crucial for maintaining redox balance and for providing proper PKA-mediated protein phosphorylation during capacitation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70945e878c28a0473bb8b8","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","5e709217878c28a04738fc41","5e709444878c28a0473b9457"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"21","pagesFromTo":"art. no 72 (1-23)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70945e878c28a0473bb8b8","5e709444878c28a0473b9457","5e709217878c28a04738fc41","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547757b","mniswId":"3366","title":"Cell Communication and Signaling","issn":"1478-811X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"092e5a0c-d6cd-4f2e-ba41-1b640e01eb6a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sperm","Capacitation","Bull","S-nitrosylation","S-glutathionylation","Tyrosine phosphorylation","Peroxyredoxin"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060410396"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e8155fdbe8322e23c40bc","name":"Nunzio","lastName":"D'Anna","documentHash":"81200ce3-a810-410a-ab7f-727c97fee08e"},{"objectId":"676e8155fdbe8322e23c40bb","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Zinno","documentHash":"52f3a23f-91ee-4568-8ed8-c7a5da563e7e"},{"objectId":"676e8155fdbe8322e23c40ba","name":"Chiara","lastName":"Giudice","documentHash":"bd03658e-9a76-43e7-80a9-b2d730252eb2"},{"objectId":"676e8155fdbe8322e23c40b9","name":"Pasqual","lastName":"Silvestre","documentHash":"49384ee0-830d-434d-a5e7-75bb1ba2e5b8"},{"objectId":"676e8155fdbe8322e23c40b8","name":"Michele","lastName":"Capasso","documentHash":"c699d432-1b17-4d40-b70a-8c2520356c44"},{"objectId":"676e8155fdbe8322e23c40b7","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Rawicka","documentHash":"09d466ac-2dc9-4575-b984-69fd68e452df"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59eb","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Juśkiewicz","uuid":"1644050D67ACD80B8BC27ADF8B38AD7DEAFE9E8BEFA53E0A8AF6EFE84AA8E8DEB184121515D6283EE52388411624DBC5FA5D10A17FD77F08CC13332E6FE84C49","documentHash":"8b9659f7-943c-408b-b92c-d518b23bb150"}],"objectId":"676e8155fdbe8322e23c40b6","doi":"10.1053/j.jepm.2022.10.002","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85141752000&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Ophthalmic examination findings in captive ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta, Linnaeus 1758)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to document normal ophthalmic findings and ocular anomalies in captive ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) and to establish reference intervals for the Schirmer tear test-1 (STT) and intraocular pressure (IOP).

One of the biologically active nutritional compounds is vitamin D3, which activates via its metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) the nuclear receptor VDR (vitamin D receptor). Vitamin D3 can be synthesized endogenously in our skin, but since we spend long times indoors and often live at higher latitudes where for many winter months UV-B radiation is too low, it became a true vitamin. The ligand-inducible transcription factor VDR is expressed in the majority of human tissues and cell types, where it modulates the epigenome at thousands of genomic sites. In a tissue-specific fashion this results in the up- and downregulation of primary vitamin D target genes, some of which are involved in attenuating oxidative stress. Vitamin D affects a wide range of physiological functions including the control of metabolism, bone formation and immunity. In this review, we will discuss how the epigenome- and transcriptome-wide effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its receptor VDR serve as a master example in nutrigenomics.

However, how the SCMC controls the DNA methylation required to regulate imprinting remains poorly defined. We generated a mouse line carrying a Padi6 missense variant that was identified in a family with Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome and MLID. If homozygous in female mice, this variant resulted in interruption of embryo development at the two-cell stage. Single-cell multiomic analyses demonstrated defective maturation of Padi6 mutant oocytes and incomplete DNA demethylation, down-regulation of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) genes, up-regulation of maternal decay genes, and developmental delay in two-cell embryos developing from Padi6 mutant oocytes but little effect on genomic imprinting. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses showed reduced levels of UHRF1 in oocytes and abnormal localization of DNMT1 and UHRF1 in both oocytes and zygotes. Treatment with 5-azacytidine reverted DNA hypermethylation but did not rescue the developmental arrest of mutant embryos.

Our previous research indicated that one of the problems with CASA analysis is that sperm adheres to glass slides, which was noted in common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Supplementing activation solutions (AS) with proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) or casein eliminates this problem and improves sperm motility. However, there is a lack of information regarding the minimal effective concentration of these proteins for ide (Leuciscus idus) sperm motility measurements. The present study is the first to compare four AS-Woynarovich, Lahnsteiner, Kucharczyk, and Perchec–for ide sperm motility activation. Woynarovich and Perchec solutions were selected and supplemented with different concentrations of BSA (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0%) and casein (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0%) for further motility measurements. Compared to pure Woynarovich and Perchec solutions (without proteins), the addition of the minimum concentration of BSA and casein (i.e., 0.25%) significantly improved CASA parameters of ide sperm. This dose was also sufficient for preventing sperm from adhering to glass slides. The different BSA (0.5–1.0%) and casein (1.0–2.0%) concentrations in Woynarovich and Perchec solutions affected CASA parameters differently. ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to compare four activation solutions (AS)—Woynarovich, Lahnsteiner, Kucharczyk, and Perchec—with the addition of 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for ide (Leuciscus idus) sperm activation and analysis with a CASA system. It was found that ide sperm can be activated using each AS within a pH range of 7.4–9.0 and an osmolality range of 160–200 mOsm kg−1. The effect of Woynarovich and Perchec solutions supplemented with BSA and casein at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0% were also analyzed during the experiment. These two AS without protein supplementation (pure solutions) were the controls. Woynarovich and Perchec solutions supplemented with the minimum BSA concentration (i.e., 0.25%) significantly improved sperm motility (89.05% and 86.63%, respectively) compared to the controls (20.39 and 28.48%, respectively). Similar increases were also noted in progressively motile sperm (PRG, %), the curvilinear velocity of sperm (VCL, µm s−1), and the amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH, µm). A similar trend in CASA parameters was also noted when casein was added to Woynarovich and Perchec solutions at a concentration of 0.25%. We concluded that 0.25% doses of each of the proteins were sufficient to prevent sperm adhesion to glass slides, and they can be used in research on ide sperm motility measurements."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c11d8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art. no 572 (1-14)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67695cc8fdbe8317b9a21244","67695cc8fdbe8317b9a21245","67695cc8fdbe8317b9a21246","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11d8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sperm adhesion","albumin","CASA","casein","sperm motility"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060410553"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"651e1fa940e3ff22d3487bf4","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kuliga","uuid":"7F6B0E7BEB2FBE9BADB35E989A60475C0741C0BBBB9482082FE9427C2E90E7877DA19A852754D0F956DAB24A9E5E5528C4ACB2146BEE77D83B345F22D1613557","documentHash":"7180ba27-e1a8-476d-a169-4ac221edb00a"},{"objectId":"6350b2a9752340623bbeb2da","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Wnorowska","uuid":"2EE42CD914990213235A5FF0E8A18D454138C2A040C67A58629B0F7340C7630D008CB5CCD9C59FBF568D0F141314C1230212F935F14FED392C18096CAEBEFB00","documentHash":"4ee163b8-4bb4-41a6-ad41-d0bb16587dab"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5aef","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Wróblewska","uuid":"5DB03D00276FB168A632F58946904D68371579A788199D21A9EF92ED0D66A6CE10D4942D9186141FE9863E443F60CBF7B7368A38845839154002943427732A15","documentHash":"56465ee4-d650-4e09-bfd2-a0d6e9de84a5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e9d9cfdbe8322e23d4230","doi":"10.3390/molecules28248081","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85180662541&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Bioactive Dairy-Fermented Products and Phenolic Compounds: Together or Apart","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fermented dairy products (e.g., yogurt, kefir, and buttermilk) are significant in the dairy industry. They are less immunoreactive than the raw materials from which they are derived. The attractiveness of these products is based on their bioactivity and properties that induce immune or anti-inflammatory processes. In the search for new solutions, plant raw materials with beneficial effects have been combined to multiply their effects or obtain new properties. Polyphenols (e.g., flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans, and stilbenes) are present in fruit and vegetables, but also in coffee, tea, or wine. They reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, or inflammation. Hence, it is becoming valuable to combine dairy proteins with polyphenols, of which epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and chlorogenic acid (CGA) show a particular predisposition to bind to milk proteins (e.g., α-lactalbumin β-lactoglobulin, αs1-casein, and κ-casein). Reducing the allergenicity of milk proteins by combining them with polyphenols is an essential issue. As potential ‘metabolic prebiotics’, they also contribute to stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria and inhibiting pathogenic bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract. In silico methods, mainly docking, assess the new structures of conjugates and the consequences of the interactions that are formed between proteins and polyphenols, as well as to predict their action in the body. © 2023 by the authors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6350b2a9752340623bbeb2da","651e1fa940e3ff22d3487bf4","5e709411878c28a0473b5aef"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"art. no 8081 (1-35)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709411878c28a0473b5aef","651e1fa940e3ff22d3487bf4","6350b2a9752340623bbeb2da"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","documentHash":"8615ffac-9999-41cd-9658-bd5ed633cde5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["combined products","docking","gastrointestinal tract","interactions","milk and its fermented products","phenolic compounds"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060410571"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e5396fdbe8322e23b99de","name":"Susanne E.","lastName":"Ulbrich","documentHash":"482de897-92a4-4864-85ea-763c6944a757"},{"objectId":"676e5396fdbe8322e23b99dd","name":"Vera","lastName":"Weijden","documentHash":"ac000897-33d0-421d-a9e8-6b431df6a4b9"},{"objectId":"65c44ab840e3ff0466a35393","name":"Monika","lastName":"Baryła","uuid":"63B6547CBE67E18469EDDAA97FBAB9059F8B110E110805D82BD5B464C833BF6C79026A73186528EDA7DB3EE2FA030F6C51FA42D6304DBFE2822D811CA0F1B178","documentHash":"230321c2-8ff8-4d7f-9608-1b6196bcc795"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be650","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kaczyński","uuid":"0A248467284F8A32D78DE151E17F76F0B0D7F74D1E175467F2CFB7F0174D38CD71A8F47946EC47A65BE157A9BEAC0B2ACC105D5244909387BF8E42FE948E4108","documentHash":"f06520d0-e419-4804-9355-1d1d6b57d2bd"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wacławik","uuid":"496211A3CA3E0C3000CB143360153CD2CA4C25C7D09E2739E6BD0345DE2114A610646BDA50E47E9AA0E9AA85632166E305A88A19640EA381329730E01677EFB9","documentHash":"d73d3626-ce91-497a-a404-0135b4a504fb"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbc4","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Goryszewska-Szczurek","uuid":"E19F6082DD63B33D67D087E59A20C172513C7A8F936333BB013DF9767F61516A013FCFD83ABAE98DCD230661B5C6AEEA154689E34E6D8A740D96DF0FCED49A7B","documentHash":"b044b623-3289-4475-89a0-3229ef49ea17"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e5396fdbe8322e23b99dc","doi":"10.1093/biolre/ioac193","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Novel role for conceptus signals in mRNA expression regulation by DNA methylation in porcine endometrium during early pregnancy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"During early pregnancy, porcine conceptuses (the embryos with associated membranes) secrete estradiol-17β (E2)—their major signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy—and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Both hormones induce prominent changes of the endometrial transcriptome in vivo. Studies on endometrial pathologies have shown that E2 affects gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms related to DNA methylation. Herein, we determined the effects of E2 and PGE2 alone, and a combined E2 + PGE2 treatment administered into the uterine lumen in vivo on the expression and activity of DNA-methyltransferases (DNMT) and on CpG methylation patterns of selected genes in porcine endometrium. To compare the effect of treatment with the physiological effect of pregnancy, endometria from day 12 pregnant/cyclic gilts were included. Both E2 and PGE2 significantly reduced the expression of DNMTs. Likewise, the expressions of DNMT1 and DNMT3A were decreased on day 12 of pregnancy compared to the estrous cycle. DNMT activity increased in endometrial samples following E2 treatment and in gilts on day 12 of pregnancy. Treatment with E2 alone and/or simultaneously with PGE2 altered endometrial DNA methylation of CpG sites of ADAMTS20, ADH1C, BGN, PSAT1 and WNT5A. Different CpG methylation patterns of ADAMTS20, BGN, DMBT1, RASSF1 and WNT5A were found in the endometrium on day 12 of pregnancy compared to day 12 of the estrous cycle. Significant correlations were detected between CpG methylation and gene expression for ADAMTS20, ADH1C, BGN, DMBT1, PSAT1 and WNT5A.

A study has revealed that spermatozoa alters the gene expression in bovine oviductal epithelial cells (BOECs) remotely via bio-active particles, thus acting as a cue to the oviduct prior to their arrival. However, very little attention has been paid to the question of whether spermatozoa could alter the cargo of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from BOECs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the alterations in small non-coding RNAs in EVs cargo derived from BOECs when incubated with spermatozoa in contact and non-contact co-culture models. After 4 h of incubation the EVs were isolated from the conditioned media, followed by small non-coding sequencing of the BOEC derived EVs. Our results revealed that EVs from both co-culture models contained distinct cargo in form of miRNA, fragmented mRNA versus control. The pathway enrichment analysis revealed that EV miRNA from direct co-culture were involved in the biological processes associated with phagocytosis, macroautophagy, placenta development, cellular responses to TNF and FGF. The mRNA fragments also varied within the different groups and mapped to the exonic regions of the transcriptome providing vital insights regarding the changes in cellular transcriptome on the arrival of spermatozoa. The findings of this study suggest that spermatozoa, in contact as well as remotely, alter the EV cargo of female reproductive tract epithelial cells which might be playing an essential role in pre and post-fertilization events."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5af0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"737-755","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676912dbfdbe834b51564efd","676912dbfdbe834b51564efe","676912dbfdbe834b51564eff","676912dbfdbe834b51564f00","676912dbfdbe834b51564f01","5e709411878c28a0473b5af0","676912dbfdbe834b51564f03","676912dbfdbe834b51564f04"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478531","mniswId":"10416","title":"Journal of Cell Communication and Signaling","issn":"1873-9601","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"57c6bcdf-9d8f-4bcb-a406-2a2e2854edb8"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Extracellular vesicles","RNA","Preconception","Oviduct","Spermatozoa"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060410637"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c120d","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Topolska","uuid":"ED6AEEFCDF3A4A51A3789757280F1B4D91423E0BA13FF3748DC4FBDE22EAABE1C03CEAD624CB15F181F2B1E8B29F7D411DFEC79E86C3E5B3A88E64B48FCE620C","documentHash":"3526422f-ff33-422e-8e18-07c5f27a6cc0"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be65c","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wronkowska","uuid":"7AD9D7133FEED3901C208150BF6A4BEC80D1D5476AC1D8C3F2A1D6CC435EA47BBDE118C6497839B2A1CE9986E04B5B72B7E49A7CBCB10520840247E859D56212","documentHash":"cac22030-ab3d-4958-9588-afa00449da3c"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Wiczkowski","uuid":"A445B60E2C80F5319C08EF716E136CD876DC26A2A64B90215992326CEC3E88C747A494DD05BCE2A7CEB5F7E02C4FB6FA78E34EA5D616429F09576334B9B3ED03","documentHash":"5674033e-a108-4b65-93d8-84a69c4a35e7"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c25","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Szawara-Nowak","uuid":"B0BD2E293A5F29396A1B3C26F7CF06A1AF7F116A444CB00806BCC84D03C9337F9C81DF1004642415E197D4EEE378DC5D7D366F60A88301E6B0C2BBC16D3348F4","documentHash":"ea32c4ef-c83e-4530-be19-08fd152a473f"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588a","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":"ACDF393EDD5617E052F030A01229E8428BB6016E08FDEE5C1E197E7D62E799573B6A7AEB725233560EB0788143DDD3D158DAC6D9162C1007A8B980A24A12C7D1","documentHash":"3517728d-3d41-4845-b4aa-3df0dd950582"},{"objectId":"5e7093f7878c28a0473b41a3","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Piskuła","uuid":"4582BC226B489857AE957B3334CAEA991424FCCC587D91BFE93A97599A84F93E970C039AED805D1D20D9EF9FC624D24792101AC245E0D73F853CDB647157DCA1","documentHash":"bc4fa630-f9bf-4ed6-a0cb-2a1afff52c1d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e9cb3fdbe8322e23d3da8","doi":"10.3390/molecules28062746","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85152070016&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Identification and bioaccessibility of Maillard reaction products and phenolic compounds in buckwheat biscuits formulated from flour fermented by Rhizopus oligosporus 2710","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The identification and potential bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds using the highly sensitive micro-HPLC-QTRAP/MS/MS technique and Maillard reaction products (MRPs) in buckwheat biscuits formulated from flours, raw and roasted, fermented by Rhizopus oligosporus 2710 was addressed in this study after in vitro digestion.

The fermented buckwheat flours used for baking affected the nutritional value of biscuits in comparison to the control biscuits in the context of the twice-increased FAST index. More than three times higher value of the browning index was noted in control and tested biscuits after digestion in vitro indicating the high bioaccessibility of melanoidins. Our results showed the presence of ten phenolic acids and eight flavonoids in the investigated biscuits. Among phenolic acids, vanillic, syringic, and protocatechuic were predominant while in the group of flavonoids, rutin, epicatechin, and vitexin were the main compounds in analyzed biscuits. Generally, the lower potential bioaccessibility of phenolic acids and higher potential bioaccessibility of flavonoids was found for biscuits obtained from buckwheat flours fermented by fungi compared to control biscuits obtained from non-fermented flours.

The by-products from the vegetable industry can provide an added source of fibre, essential oils, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and bioactive compounds, such as phenolics. Many of these compounds have bioactive properties, such as antioxidative, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activity, which could be used, especially in the prevention or treatment of lifestyle diseases connected with the intestinal milieu, including dysbiosis and immune-mediated diseases resulting in inflammation.

Impairment in this response may closely associate with obesity, and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) family genes may be involved in the process. However, human data linking NFAT and AT remains elusive. The aim of this study was to assess the expression of NFAT family genes and markers of adipogenesis in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) among normal-weight and overweight/obese individuals before and after weight loss, in relation to insulin sensitivity. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 45 participants, 15 normal-weight (control group) and 30 overweight or obese, who underwent a 12-week dietary intervention (DI) program. Before and after the program hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and SAT biopsy were conducted. Before DI, a positive correlations was observed in the expression of NFATc1, NFATc4, and NFAT5 with insulin sensitivity. The expression of NFAT family genes and markers of adipogenesis in SAT was lower in individuals with overweight or obesity compared to normal-weight. Additionally, a positive correlation was noted between NFAT family genes and adipogenesis markers both before and after weight loss. Following the DI program, there was an increase in the expression of NFATc3, NFATc4, and NFAT5 in SAT. CONCLUSION: Decreased SAT expression of NFAT genes in obesity is partly reversed in response to weight loss. NFAT genes in SAT are associated with insulin sensitivity and adipogenesis.

Major contaminants include pesticide residues, mycotoxins, and heavy metals. The most significant global challenge is their prompt detection in fruits and vegetables (conventionally grown/organic produce). Foodborne outbreaks are detrimental to the economy and public health both nationally and on a global scale. The scope of the study is to analyze and summarize advanced techniques like immunoassay and advances in biosensors for the detection of food contaminants so that the impact of the latter can be minimized. The preferable techniques for pesticide residues, mycotoxins, and heavy metals detections are outlined, along with their merits, demerits, and future recommendations to ensure adequate quality control measures. The Ag and Au-based biosensors and quantum-dot-based biosensors, especially lateral flow immunoassay, have shown fast and on-spot detection of pesticides and mycotoxins, respectively. Whereas, for heavy metals, electrochemical biosensors are recommended. Biosensors are found highly sensitive, specific, simple, and user-friendly. The higher cost of advanced biosensors, single-time use, and specificity to few contaminants limit their use. Nanotechnology interventions can increase biosensor performance, leading to more economical and productive detection of food contaminants. A comprehensive and efficient approach that can quickly identify multiple food contaminants while being cost-effective and user-friendly is the need of the hour."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"205","pagesFromTo":"art. no 111292","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676ea82cfdbe8322e23da96c","676ea82cfdbe8322e23da96d","676ea82cfdbe8322e23da96e","676ea82cfdbe8322e23da96f","676ea82cfdbe8322e23da970","676ea82cfdbe8322e23da971","676ea82cfdbe8322e23da972","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","676ea82cfdbe8322e23da973","676ea82cfdbe8322e23da974"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e72","mniswId":"14340","title":"MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL","issn":"0026-265X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"974e1996-f199-4202-989b-a99250503b3b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060410723"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e45b0fdbe8322e23b82f1","name":"Pier G.","lastName":"Peiretti","documentHash":"728de4a0-d7e5-453c-86d4-2f8794ac402f"},{"objectId":"676e45b0fdbe8322e23b82f0","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Gai","documentHash":"6442db49-4f47-4421-ac62-952a3264d606"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c1204","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Sulewska","uuid":"05EB949174E6B29574DD48DAEAAAB5139F44212AE29E99A70883B7472E33B3462D2799BF4A6282DDEE3018002AF9DBA41AD9B97B7B8ABE09DEE5EA9ECB6FBDC4","documentHash":"c0c8648d-8fee-4894-bb71-f39a2dd6ed56"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b910b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Janiak","uuid":"ED89E67B99A387674B4297A18C3C3CD8AA8413DFBA0D90FADF253FA46010EC54CE3537CDB7CD5E3A22D8F73EACE2151361A73BC32B454350089D09ED3167E4D5","documentHash":"21519e0f-0512-44de-95f6-c1ff5f5d7037"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59e7","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Karamać","uuid":"EA8089F94A8D72605CF49B5A6CE075DB78DBC5FEEB3347DA87E1C34DFF188480B746E4D91ED4BCEA493D67CB34229C7B3C4423C7019602EAF7F0FCC10A661CB9","documentHash":"1f0b8053-1703-4d7c-94cc-8213a343b75a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e45b0fdbe8322e23b82ef","doi":"10.3390/molecules28041807","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85149053399&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Phenolic compound profile and antioxidant capacity of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) harvested at different growth stages","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The profile of phenolic compounds changes during the growth of a plant and this change affects its antioxidant potential. The aim of this research has been to find the growth stage of flax with the highest antioxidant capacity, and to determine the phenolic compounds responsible for such a capacity. Flax was harvested in six growth stages: from stem extension to mature seeds. The phenolic compounds were identified using LC–TOF–MS and quantified in an extract and in the fresh matter (FM) of each growth stage. The radical scavenging activity against ABTS•+ and DPPH•, the ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and the antioxidant activity in the β-carotene-linoleic acid emulsion system were determined. Mono- and di-C-glycosyl flavones were found to be the most abundant phenolics of the aerial parts of flax, which also showed the highest content of isoorientin (210–538 µg/g FM). Coniferin, its derivative, and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives were also detected. The plant was richer in flavone C-glycosides from stem extension to seed ripening (1105–1413 µg/g FM) than at the mature seed stage (557 µg/g FM). Most of the individual flavone C-glycoside contents in the extracts decreased when increasingly older plants were considered; however, the isoorientin content did not change significantly from the steam extension to the seed ripening stages. The antiradical activity against ABTS•+ and FRAP was higher for the aerial parts of the flax harvested at the flowering, brown capsule, and seed ripening stages, mainly due to the presence of flavone C-glycosides. The oxidation of β-carotene-linoleic acid emulsion was instead inhibited more effectively by the extracts from plants at the brown capsule and mature seed stages. Coniferin and its derivative were significantly involved in this activity. The extracts from the aerial parts of the flax harvested from flowering to seed ripening could be a valuable source of flavone C-glycosides for use as nutraceuticals and components of functional foods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b59e7","5e709442878c28a0473b910b","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1204"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"art. no 1807 (1-15)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676e45b0fdbe8322e23b82f0","5e709442878c28a0473b910b","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1204","676e45b0fdbe8322e23b82f1","5e709410878c28a0473b59e7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","documentHash":"8615ffac-9999-41cd-9658-bd5ed633cde5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["linseed","flavonoids","C-glycosides","morphological stages","aerial parts of the plant","radical scavenging activity","emulsion system oxidation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060410727"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67696048fdbe8317b9a29628","name":"Geert","lastName":"Opsomer","documentHash":"bd6cd82c-e873-4563-847d-efd8fdb5f686"},{"objectId":"67696048fdbe8317b9a29627","name":"Mieke","lastName":"Van Eetvelde","documentHash":"1a097722-483b-425c-acc9-97130e152c50"},{"objectId":"67696048fdbe8317b9a29626","name":"Manon","lastName":"Dewulf","documentHash":"985fc736-86ba-49b1-9945-3263e092ea01"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Wiczkowski","uuid":"A445B60E2C80F5319C08EF716E136CD876DC26A2A64B90215992326CEC3E88C747A494DD05BCE2A7CEB5F7E02C4FB6FA78E34EA5D616429F09576334B9B3ED03","documentHash":"5674033e-a108-4b65-93d8-84a69c4a35e7"}],"objectId":"67696048fdbe8317b9a29625","doi":"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2023.02.007","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85148705868&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Dairy calves are exposed to isoflavones during the developmentally most sensitive period of their life","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Isoflavones represent a class of phytoestrogens present in plants. In dairy cows, dietary isoflavones have been shown to negatively affect reproductive performance. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have yet been conducted to determine if calves are pre- or neonatally confronted with isoflavones and their metabolites. In the present study, we hypothesize that isoflavones are passed on from the dam to the offspring in utero. Twenty-three pregnant Holstein Friesian dams and their calves, originating from three commercial dairy farms in Belgium, were included. Heparin blood samples were collected during the first, second, and third trimester of gestation from all pregnant dams. Heparin blood and hair samples were obtained from the offspring within 24 h after parturition. Colostrum samples were collected from a subset of eight dams to determine the concentration of isoflavones and their metabolites. During the first and second trimester of gestation, the dams were fed either a youngstock (nulliparous dams) or a lactation (multiparous dams) diet. During the third trimester, both groups received a similar dry cow diet. Genistein and daidzein levels were unaffected by diet type, while their metabolite [equol, dihydrodaidzein (DHD), and o-desmethylangolensin (ODMA)] concentrations were significantly higher in the lactation group. Furthermore, metabolite concentrations decreased significantly during gestation. Isoflavones and their metabolites were detected in all colostrum samples. No correlation could be found between levels in colostrum and blood of pregnant dams or calves. Peripheral levels of isoflavones and their metabolites were significantly lower in newborn calves in comparison to their dams. Genistein and daidzein concentrations were found to be significantly higher in the calves' hair versus blood samples, suggesting prenatal exposure to isoflavones for an extended period of time. In contrast, no isoflavone metabolites were detected in the calves’ hair samples. This is the first study to demonstrate that dairy calves are exposed to isoflavones during the developmentally most sensitive period of their lives.

Porcine conceptuses signalize their presence by secreting multiple factors, of which estradiol-17β (E2) is considered the major embryonic signal initiating the maternal recognition of pregnancy. During this time, a limited supply of prostaglandin (PGF2α) to the corpora lutea and an increased secretion of luteoprotective factors (e.g., E2 and prostaglandin E2 [PGE2]) lead to the corpus luteum's maintained function of secreting progesterone, which in turn primes the uterus for implantation. Further, embryo implantation is related to establishing an appropriate proinflammatory environment coordinated by the secretion of proinflammatory mediators including cytokines, growth factors, and lipid mediators of both endometrial and conceptus origin. The novel, dual role of PGF2α has been underlined. Recent studies involving high-throughput technologies and sophisticated experimental models identified a number of novel factors and revealed complex relationships between these factors and those already established. Hence, it seems that early pregnancy should be regarded as a sequence of processes orchestrated by pleiotropic factors that are involved in redundancy and compensatory mechanisms that preserve the essential functions critical for implantation and placenta formation. Therefore, establishing the hierarchy between all molecules present at the embryo–maternal interface is now even more challenging"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d6878c28a04739dbc4","5e70940d878c28a0473b588e","5e70947f878c28a0473be650","65c44ab840e3ff0466a35393"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"90","pagesFromTo":"658-672","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947f878c28a0473be650","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbc4","65c44ab840e3ff0466a35393","5e70940d878c28a0473b588e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f0b","mniswId":"14577","title":"MOLECULAR REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT","issn":"1040-452X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"8c45eb76-57e7-4b31-a83f-0fee4d8c88e9"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["early pregnancy","endometrium","estradiol","implantation","prostaglandins"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060410778"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67694e09fdbe8317b9a17b03","name":"Gianfranco","lastName":"Balboni","documentHash":"759f6408-dfd3-436f-8b86-48a474985991"},{"objectId":"65c44ab840e3ff0466a35393","name":"Monika","lastName":"Baryła","uuid":"63B6547CBE67E18469EDDAA97FBAB9059F8B110E110805D82BD5B464C833BF6C79026A73186528EDA7DB3EE2FA030F6C51FA42D6304DBFE2822D811CA0F1B178","documentHash":"230321c2-8ff8-4d7f-9608-1b6196bcc795"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be650","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kaczyński","uuid":"0A248467284F8A32D78DE151E17F76F0B0D7F74D1E175467F2CFB7F0174D38CD71A8F47946EC47A65BE157A9BEAC0B2ACC105D5244909387BF8E42FE948E4108","documentHash":"f06520d0-e419-4804-9355-1d1d6b57d2bd"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wacławik","uuid":"496211A3CA3E0C3000CB143360153CD2CA4C25C7D09E2739E6BD0345DE2114A610646BDA50E47E9AA0E9AA85632166E305A88A19640EA381329730E01677EFB9","documentHash":"d73d3626-ce91-497a-a404-0135b4a504fb"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbc4","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Goryszewska-Szczurek","uuid":"E19F6082DD63B33D67D087E59A20C172513C7A8F936333BB013DF9767F61516A013FCFD83ABAE98DCD230661B5C6AEEA154689E34E6D8A740D96DF0FCED49A7B","documentHash":"b044b623-3289-4475-89a0-3229ef49ea17"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67694e09fdbe8317b9a17b02","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-32132-3","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85151223916&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Prokineticin 1 is a novel factor regulating porcine corpus luteum function","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Prokineticin 1 (PROK1) is a pleiotropic factor secreted by endocrine glands; however, its role has not been studied in the corpus luteum (CL) during pregnancy in any species.

PROK1, acting via PROKR1, stimulated the expression of genes involved in progesterone synthesis, as well as progesterone secretion by luteal tissue. PROK1–PROKR1 signaling reduced apoptosis and increased the viability of luteal cells. PROK1 acting through PROKR1 stimulated angiogenesis by increasing capillary-like structure formation by luteal endothelial cells and elevating angiogenin gene expression and VEGFA secretion by luteal tissue.

Intake of a small quantity of the right kind of tannins may in fact be beneficial to human health. This chapter reports on the chemical structure of condensed tannins, their content in plants and food of plant origin, how they are extracted, and methods for their determination. A description of the effects of processing on condensed tannins is discussed and includes soaking, dehulling, thermal processing (i.e., cooking, boiling, autoclaving, extrusion), and germination. The astringency of condensed tannins is described in relation to their interactions with proteins. Finally, details about the biological properties of condensed tannins, including their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-diabetic, and anti-obesity activities, are reviewed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"110","pagesFromTo":"327-398","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","676ea61efdbe8322e23da4bb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff758ad49b31ccec4d055","title":"Advances in Food and Nutrition Research","issn":"1043-4526","documentHash":"ac6b5b1e-6c58-4afc-95ae-cc0e3dcf6e90"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060410839"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5891","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Blitek","uuid":"4263ED68AEBDFB512F30858455187BB115ADECCF4A1CC327E3D1CFDFA12A86C092D7999418469C4C1449C975B17696E1C34600F2CB46B681901338A10D56E140","documentHash":"ee8181af-e24a-458d-863a-637f020ef098"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db92","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":"B098C0A528257742FE7260630F778D12964C7B5C6227723C0B82DB42874A1368CF6017A4E9CA6B7F39C9E84245C06E67EF1E4D8E3489D40F22A3D57CCE9F1BE1","documentHash":"71a82dd5-3af9-42bb-bfe3-be6e20ae2dfa"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"677269a2fdbe831015c5da4a","doi":"10.3390/ijms252011102","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Expression profiles of fatty acid transporters and the role of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the porcine endometrium","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fatty acids (FAs) are important for cell membrane composition, eicosanoid synthesis, and metabolic processes. Membrane proteins that facilitate FA transport into cells include FA translocase (also known as CD36) and FA transporter proteins (encoded by SLC27A genes). The present study aimed to examine expression profiles of FA transporters in the endometrium of cyclic and early pregnant gilts on days 3 to 20 after estrus and the possible regulation by conceptus signals and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs). The effect of PUFAs on prostaglandin (PG) synthesis and transcript abundance of genes related to FA action and metabolism, angiogenesis, and immune response was also determined. Day after estrus and reproductive status of animals affected FA transporter expression, with greater levels of CD36, SLC27A1, and SLC27A4 observed in pregnant than in cyclic gilts. Conceptus-conditioned medium and/or estradiol-17β stimulated SLC27A1 and CD36 expression. Among PUFAs, linoleic acid decreased SLC27A1 and SLC27A6 mRNA expression, while arachidonic, docosahexaenoic, and eicosapentaenoic acids increased SLC27A4 transcript abundance. Moreover, arachidonic acid stimulated ACOX1, CPT1A, and IL1B expression and increased PGE2 and PGI2 secretion. In turn, α-linolenic acid up-regulated VEGFA, FGF2, FABP4, and PPARG mRNA expression.

Equine endometrosis causes histological changes and alterations in the secretory function of endometrial cells. These alterations lead to changes in the endometrium and early pregnancy dysfunction. Thus, this condition is one of the main causes of subfertility in mares, resulting in enormous economic losses to the horse-breeding industry. In general, fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. It destroys normal tissue architecture and compromises tissue function. The cellular and molecular events associated with the development of tissue fibrosis are complex and poorly understood. In recent years, research has been carried out on the involvement of immune cells and their products in the pathogenesis of endometrosis in mares. These studies focused mainly on the role of cytokines, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, interleukin (IL) 6, IL-1β, prostaglandin (PG), and components of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET), such as myeloperoxidase, cathepsin G, and elastase, in the most important processes associated with the development of endometrosis. The results showed that TGF-β1, IL-1β, IL-6, and PGs act on myofibroblast differentiation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of ECM protein, and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and their inhibitors. It suggests their involvement in processes associated with pathological endometrial remodeling. Moreover, the response of endometrial tissue to selected factors changes according to the stage of endometrosis. The action of inflammatory mediators on processes related to the development of fibrosis shows a connection between inflammation and endometrosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c33bff9543c723365441d3","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","5e70945e878c28a0473bb8c4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"79","pagesFromTo":"11-16","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf","60c33bff9543c723365441d3","5e70945e878c28a0473bb8c4","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec008dfad49b31ccedc1275","title":"Medycyna Weterynaryjna-Veterinary Medicine-Science and Practice","doi":"10.21521/mw","issn":"0025-8628","websiteLink":"http://medycynawet.edu.pl/index.php/home","documentHash":"fcf5587a-dffc-4119-905e-b665140f98a4"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["endometrosis","mare","inflammatory mediators","fibrosis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060410944"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e8b81fdbe8322e23c9239","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Sznajder-Katarzyńska","documentHash":"52da9a34-be8c-43fc-a16a-6b5856cee7cb"},{"objectId":"676e8b81fdbe8322e23c9238","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Surma","documentHash":"ad3f0f50-05e3-4d02-935e-ec4e072b9896"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Wiczkowski","uuid":"A445B60E2C80F5319C08EF716E136CD876DC26A2A64B90215992326CEC3E88C747A494DD05BCE2A7CEB5F7E02C4FB6FA78E34EA5D616429F09576334B9B3ED03","documentHash":"5674033e-a108-4b65-93d8-84a69c4a35e7"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588a","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":"ACDF393EDD5617E052F030A01229E8428BB6016E08FDEE5C1E197E7D62E799573B6A7AEB725233560EB0788143DDD3D158DAC6D9162C1007A8B980A24A12C7D1","documentHash":"3517728d-3d41-4845-b4aa-3df0dd950582"},{"objectId":"5e7093f7878c28a0473b41a3","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Piskuła","uuid":"4582BC226B489857AE957B3334CAEA991424FCCC587D91BFE93A97599A84F93E970C039AED805D1D20D9EF9FC624D24792101AC245E0D73F853CDB647157DCA1","documentHash":"bc4fa630-f9bf-4ed6-a0cb-2a1afff52c1d"}],"objectId":"676e8b81fdbe8322e23c9237","doi":"10.1002/etc.5743","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85173555547&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Detection of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in High-Protein Food Products","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) belong to the emerging class of persistent organohalogenated contaminants in the environment.

Knockout of ZP3 in a ZP3-expressing lung adenocarcinoma cell line, significantly decreased cell viability, proliferation, and migration rates in vitro. Zona pellucida 3 knock out (ZP3-KO) cell tumors inoculated in vivo in immunodeficient non-obese diabetic, severe combined immunodeficient mice showed significant inhibition of tumor growth and mitigation of the malignant phenotype. RNA sequencing revealed the deregulation of cell migration/adhesion signaling pathways in ZP3-KO cells. This novel functional relevance of ZP3 in lung cancer emphasized the suitability of ZP3 as a target in cancer immunotherapy and as a potential cancer biomarker."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"155","pagesFromTo":"1846-1857","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67739e31fdbe833e3d1678fd","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f7","67739e31fdbe833e3d1678fe","67739e31fdbe833e3d1678ff","67739e31fdbe833e3d167900","67739e31fdbe833e3d167901","67739e31fdbe833e3d167902","67739e31fdbe833e3d167903","67739e31fdbe833e3d167904","67739e31fdbe833e3d167905","67739e31fdbe833e3d167906","67739e31fdbe833e3d167907","67739e31fdbe833e3d167908","67739e31fdbe833e3d167909","67739e31fdbe833e3d16790a","67739e31fdbe833e3d16790b","67739e31fdbe833e3d16790c","67739e31fdbe833e3d16790d","67739e31fdbe833e3d16790e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478190","mniswId":"8689","title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER","doi":"10.1002/(issn)1097-0215","issn":"0020-7136","eissn":"1097-0215","documentHash":"00442832-0a89-4559-8894-33a5bc011126"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cancer growth","lung cancer","zona pellucida 3"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060411026"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","name":"Carsten","lastName":"Carlberg","uuid":"7A3E0E7963E1192270F3903EEFFAA1A086E27754D1B393FD104F68B8A691171F30A075FDFF073A66B06C35CCE685244FF4287E47226B5FB73CCE42A85608CA83","documentHash":"50649f30-9531-42e7-8c6c-543c2bbfecb8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676954e1fdbe8317b9a1b05e","doi":"10.1016/j.steroids.2023.109271","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85164381139&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Genomic signaling of vitamin D","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"It took several hundred million years of evolution, in order to develop the endocrine vitamin D signaling system, which is formed by a nuclear receptor, the transcription factor VDR (vitamin D receptor), its ligand, the vitamin D3 metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) and several metabolizing enzymes and transport proteins. Even within the nuclear receptor superfamily the affinity of VDR for 1,25(OH)2D3 is outstandingly high (KD = 0.1 nM). The activation of VDR by 1,25(OH)2D3 is the core mechanism of genomic signaling of vitamin D3, which results in the modulation of the epigenome at thousands of promoter and enhancer regions as well as finally in the activation or repression of hundreds of target gene transcription. In addition, rapid non-genomic actions of vitamin D are described, which are mechanistically far less understood. The main function of vitamin D is to keep the human body in homeostasis. This implies the control of calcium levels, which is essential for bone mineralization, as well as for pushing of innate immunity to react sufficiently strong to microbe infection and preventing overreactions of adaptive immunity, i.e., not to cause autoimmune diseases. This review will discuss whether genomic signaling is sufficient for explaining all physiological functions of vitamin D3. © 2023 The

It is a natural consequence of occurrence of biochemical pathways in cells, promoting oxidation processes, an increase in the amount of free oxygen radicals that damage DNA, disorders in calcium ion homeostasis, interactions between lipids of cell membranes, formation of neurofibrillary tangles and deposition of toxic protein deposits. Diet modifications can delay neurometabolism disorders that occur as a result of aging, as well as limit the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study on rats was to verify the hypothesis regarding the effect of dietary addition of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs; instead of standard CuCO3) in combination with various dietary fibers on changes in hippocampus and jejunum biochemical parameters related to metabolic disorders appearing with neurological ageing in rats. Male rats were fed a control diet with containing fiber α-cellulose and a standard or enhanced content of Cu provided as CuCO3 (6.5 or 13 mg/kg diet). The diets of other groups were deprived of CuCO3 and the animals were fed diets supplemented with two CuNPs aforementioned doses, and additionally combined with four different types of dietary fiber: α-cellulose (control fiber), pectin, inulin or psyllium (Plantago psyllium). The addition of dietary CuNPs increased the level of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and decreased the levels of Tau protein, glycosylated AChE (GAChE) and Ca/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II alpha (CAMK2α) in the examined organs. To sum up, both applied doses of CuNPs, 6.5 mg and 13 mg per kg of a diet, can beneficially modulate some important parameters describing metabolic and neurodevelopmental status in the hippocampal and small intestinal tissue of rats. With regard to the fiber type added to rats’ diet, the Plantago psyllium fiber strengthened the mentioned effects of copper nanoparticles. The observed effects should be confirmed in a model study of neurodegeneration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b59eb","5e7092d6878c28a04739db85"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6772948afdbe831015c9ea61","5e709410878c28a0473b59eb","5e7092d6878c28a04739db85","6772948afdbe831015c9ea62","6772948afdbe831015c9ea63"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec003dead49b31cced788d6","title":"Annals of Animal Science","issn":"2300-8733","eissn":"2300-8733","documentHash":"9f0b0c28-a3b3-40fe-bf64-01767c1ffd8d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["copper carbonate","copper nanoparticles","dietary fiber","hippocampus","jejunum","metabolic and neurodevelopmental status"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060430259"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67739d8bfdbe833e3d16752a","name":"Graca","lastName":"Ferreira-Dias","documentHash":"35f84231-3faa-488c-8794-69779ad9e5e2"},{"objectId":"67739d8bfdbe833e3d167529","name":"Terttu","lastName":"Katila","documentHash":"e55cf839-97b8-4791-a8dc-dc65dcc3d704"},{"objectId":"67739d8bfdbe833e3d167528","name":"Takuo","lastName":"Hojo","documentHash":"badb7d4e-bbd3-412b-b1cc-c31fa0b935d1"},{"objectId":"617a0b297523400564d4b4f6","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Żebrowska","uuid":"CF73B45CD046F3AA7490F19E518EE3D8F72B45884022703B6DFD88B1E868363E9C390B72178DC59BE94119F0542B39D1C0D58706D3E8AB12B8A8A0A20A60DC15","documentHash":"75a736ee-b2b6-49cd-97e8-02a3e2e44fb2"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Skarżyński","uuid":"893E2C4B87695FF9AC23B84616C654F5B1E6FC9D903BB90BDCE1C38DABAFE563D8799DF0E9B5E427AD9DE60E48421A2744D5C1C29108A61057E0DC537A800774","orcidId":"0000-0001-9537-3560","documentHash":"f2e476d8-aceb-487d-b95e-e46c79fa4e0b"},{"objectId":"5e709405878c28a0473b503d","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Piotrowska-Tomala","uuid":"08655195301AB16CFBBAF6836407CA5B5F96284617C027E3567B21749FC0C648F26E0DA496EAE968D693FEDE9EED13373A77BDF47C0B58A830AA64F15742ED21","documentHash":"d96955e8-dcad-453c-a597-7dc8f2095fed"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szóstek-Mioduchowska","uuid":"967AF197FAE274F7A3920BD12A655DA90CD1F8A691C090E35027D38FA489D9F3DD09D69E31DFB0A2C53148A67D83239257109137F7D6023AC24209FF207A256C","documentHash":"585d4348-5759-42bf-9e5e-134716588ad9"},{"objectId":"5e709381878c28a0473ab804","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jończyk","uuid":"DCA38AB3DEDD663AB53645D9AF18011DEEAE59327966396FDDD8C00480564B95D2361A359C31836F1D816D67A7418153CBD058FEF7DFAE69B6A7885D363D4E41","documentHash":"e4eee45c-93db-40b6-b6c2-fce4f190fb50"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67739d8bfdbe833e3d167527","doi":"10.1186/s12917-024-03889-0","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85184086298&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Intrauterine devices influence prostaglandin secretion by equine uterus: in vitro and in vivo studies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BACKGROUND: Intrauterine devices (IUD) are used in the veterinary practice as the non-pharmacological method of oestrus suppression in mares. When placed in the uterus, IUD create a physical contact with the endometrium that mimics the presence of an equine embryo. However, the mechanism of their action has not been fully elucidated. The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of mechanical stimulation of IUD on mare`s endometrium in both in vitro and in vivo study. For this purpose, we demonstrated the effect of IUD on prostaglandin (PG) F2α and PGE2 secretion, and mRNA transcription of genes involved in PG synthesis pathway in equine endometrial cells in vitro. In the in vivo study, we aimed to compare short-term effect of IUD inserted on day 0 (oestrus) with day 5–6 post-ovulation (the specific time when embryo reaches uterus after fertilization) on PG secretion from equine endometrium. To determine the long-term effect on PG synthase mRNA transcription, a single endometrial biopsy was taken only once within each group of mares at certain time points of the estrous cycle from mares placement with IUD on days 0 or 5–6 post-ovualtion. RESULTS: We showed for the first time that the incubation of the endometrial cells with the presence of IUD altered the pattern of PG synthase mRNA transcription in equine epithelial and stromal endometrial cells. In vivo, in mares placement with IUD on day 0, PGE2 concentrations in blood plasma were upregulated between 1 and 6, and at 10 h after the IUD insertion, compared with the control mares (P < 0.05). Moreover, the decrease of PTGFS mRNA transcription on day 16- 18, associated with an elevation in PTGES mRNA transcription on day 20 -21 of the estrous cycle in endometrial biopsies collected from mares placement with IUD on days 5–6 suggest an antiluteolytic action of IUD during the estrous cycle. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the application of IUD may mimic the equine conceptus presence through the physical contact with the endometrium altering PG synthase transcription, and act as a potent modulator of endometrial PG secretion both in vitro and in vivo."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["617a0b297523400564d4b4f6","67739d8bfdbe833e3d167528","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf","5e709381878c28a0473ab804","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","5e709405878c28a0473b503d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"art. no 46 (1-15)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709405878c28a0473b503d","5e709381878c28a0473ab804","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf","67739d8bfdbe833e3d167528","617a0b297523400564d4b4f6","67739d8bfdbe833e3d167529","67739d8bfdbe833e3d16752a","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773ef","mniswId":"2654","title":"BMC Veterinary Research","issn":"1746-6148","documentHash":"6e3ee891-ddbb-47d0-91fb-01fb02e28526"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Endometrial cells","Horse","Prostaglandin E2","Prostaglandin F2α","Prostaglandin synthases"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060430281"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61d510b87523401fc110f957","name":"Manohara","lastName":"Mahadeva","uuid":"B3FE2AE2E9E344E968F163C9DC365C7300486F95C9128B7B51B0B20749853FE2E01A04F86772CB9E4269F19C73DEA05E3BF3ECC6629C42B288DB288B35803F35","documentHash":"73fd790e-b549-4ecb-a0ef-932262f95918"},{"objectId":"5e7094b3878c28a0473c1df3","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kowacz","uuid":"E53E9875396BEEED9291BD0D53FE6CCBDF214374BF249850F3E9A84DD949BCFB057F6F5A63DE42450C1C4EE46B539508EED2C09E9BF12DA177FC62724D4684D5","documentHash":"03d56860-f8c0-4642-99f5-546a4de878e4"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db74","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Niestępski","uuid":"A548A904F1FFB01EE0FA581389ED399BD66C5A98E3AC0F3B89A62C29BC989F2D02FA02F779174C742A6C42E2F524E80A8B6DAAD06E0951D6C140F4F6A997473E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3524-821X","documentHash":"8e849844-8f0f-4dc9-b396-16b172cf0e19"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67765f41fdbe833e6950bd23","doi":"10.1016/j.ydbio.2024.11.002","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Modifying membrane potential synchronously controls the somite's formation periodicity and growth","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Coordination between periodicity of somite formation and somite growth is crucial for regular body pattern formation during somitogenesis. Yet, the specific mechanism that links the two processes remains unclear. Using chick embryos, we demonstrate that both temporal and spatial features can be simultaneously controlled by membrane potential (Vm) of somite-forming cells. Our findings show that somites hyperpolarize as they mature, displaying step-like changes in Vm observed between specific groups of somites, reflecting the reported onset of biochemical and structural changes within them. We modify Vm by changing chemical compositions of the microenvironment of the embryo. Alteration of Vm sets a new pace of somite formation (cell migration and self-assembly) and its concurrent growth (cell proliferation) without disturbing the somite's regular aspect ratio. Our results therefore suggest that Vm has the ability to orchestrate cell proliferation, migration and self-assembly - processes that are hallmarks of embryogenesis, tumorigenesis and tissue regeneration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b3878c28a0473c1df3","61d510b87523401fc110f957","5e7092d6878c28a04739db74"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"517","pagesFromTo":"317-326","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61d510b87523401fc110f957","5e7092d6878c28a04739db74","5e7094b3878c28a0473c1df3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547792e","mniswId":"4991","title":"Developmental Biology","doi":"","issn":"0012-1606","eissn":"1095-564X","websiteLink":"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/developmental-biology","documentHash":"1e7acdf2-ac59-46f4-b162-89d22de69b1d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Chick embryo","Membrane potentials","Periodicity of somite formation","Somite growth","Cell electrophysiology","Glass microelectrodes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060430287"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67765a75fdbe833e695086ef","name":"Maryna","lastName":"Petrushko","documentHash":"33302425-8bd1-4222-9e88-5419da0368b3"},{"objectId":"628ee628752340212ccc8096","name":"Taisiia","lastName":"Yurchuk","uuid":"592256FCADFD930F5303A5ED638B24A09E64493741C5EDA50A913E9A0C5042BB7BA42CD90691FB232A09E900CAD930B9628E4E6C15700F6C6A37F0DD1F9B6D35","documentHash":"31bf5294-1387-49ef-bd5c-f6e3bc45b147"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Skarżyński","uuid":"893E2C4B87695FF9AC23B84616C654F5B1E6FC9D903BB90BDCE1C38DABAFE563D8799DF0E9B5E427AD9DE60E48421A2744D5C1C29108A61057E0DC537A800774","orcidId":"0000-0001-9537-3560","documentHash":"f2e476d8-aceb-487d-b95e-e46c79fa4e0b"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db8c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Witek","uuid":"2C277E5FD80A3685542869ABB834EEFC96FCB19A85844FD840648650CB8E9DCB4B3E1E6E62EF230BE14075E4A0E8375D3ACCD85CC5AEC73B48C2CFBCCA52E255","documentHash":"e1a5256d-3292-4679-9304-2b6a5b39c8f0"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db8b","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Likszo","uuid":"D23AB31BA061288D57FDA0E11738F95FFDD769AEC9B56313F80906BE771DC2C67C7C886A68ECF580F14B0457364855DC558082C2EA392FC4A997F6714D8087B2","documentHash":"0a426175-e277-4168-a00e-64b21a14de52"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67765a75fdbe833e695086ee","doi":"10.3390/ijms25116074","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"New approach to the cryopreservation of GV oocytes and cumulus cells through the lens of preserving the intercellular gap junctions based on the bovine model","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Differences in structural and functional properties between oocytes and cumulus cells (CCs) may cause low vitrification efficiency for cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs).

This study aimed to determine the optimal method of cryopreservation of the suspension of CCs to mature GV oocytes in vitro and to determine the level of mRNA expression of the genes (GJA1, GJA4; BCL2, BAX) and gene-specific epigenetic marks (DNMT3A) after cryopreservation and in vitro maturation (IVM) in various culture systems. We have shown that the slow freezing of CCs in microstraws preserved the largest number of viable cells with intact DNA compared with the methods of vitrification and slow freezing in microdroplets. Cryopreservation caused the upregulation of the genes Cx37 and Cx43 in the oocytes to restore gap junctions between cells. In conclusion, the presence of CCs in the co-culture system during IVM of oocytes played an important role in the regulation of the expression of the intercellular proteins Cx37 and Cx43, apoptotic changes, and oocyte methylation.

One of its main causes is chronic low-grade inflammation, mediated by the proinflammatory pathways, such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway. Interleukin (IL)-38 (IL-38) is a newly discovered cytokine that belongs to the IL-1 family. There are three hypothetical pathways through which IL-38 may bind to the specific receptors and inhibit their proinflammatory activity. Those pathways are associated with IL-36 receptor (IL-36R), IL-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 (IL1RAPL1) and IL-1 receptor 1 (IL1R1). There are studies linking IL-38 to improve insulin sensitivity through the difference in serum IL-38 in patients with insulin resistance or the correlation of IL-38 concentrations with insulin resistance indexes. However, many questions still remain regarding the biological activity of IL-38 itself and its role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. The goal of this study is to showcase IL-38, its biological activity, hypothesized signaling pathways, connection with insulin resistance and future perspectives of research on IL-38. We present that IL-38 associated signaling can be a potential target for the treatment of insulin resistance and associated diseases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62a009a8752340212cd2f056","5e709377878c28a0473aa543"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"611-616","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62a009a8752340212cd2f056","5e709377878c28a0473aa543"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a9c","mniswId":"5655","title":"Endocrine, Metabolic and Immune Disorders - Drug Targets","issn":"1871-5303","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"af407c70-259e-4077-b536-36eb0831f91b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["glucose metabolism","IL-38","inflammation","insulin resistance","insulin sensitivity","proinflammatory pathways"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060430408"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1f8","name":"Elzbieta","lastName":"Janda","documentHash":"0ed2df8b-a4f1-4ec4-99ea-ac2c69bc443e"},{"objectId":"6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1f7","name":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Mollace","documentHash":"67b91197-5ff3-48a2-aa29-65d1dcaf42b9"},{"objectId":"6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1f4","name":"Concetta","lastName":"Riillo","documentHash":"ca0fffaa-d64e-4d59-afdb-7dc4325b90ff"},{"objectId":"6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1f3","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Crupi","documentHash":"698b1b39-e39d-4f72-9543-4b0b1b726200"},{"objectId":"6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1f2","name":"Antonella","lastName":"Lascala","documentHash":"d8125a77-07a4-441a-b775-22dfb2ff5191"},{"objectId":"6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1f1","name":"Daniele","lastName":"La Russa","documentHash":"139db022-afeb-483c-97e8-39cf936a6696"},{"objectId":"6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1ee","name":"Maddalena","lastName":"Parafati","documentHash":"2f2e7756-9c9e-4328-9d22-15d4e8005e2a"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db85","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Fotschki","uuid":"B32913EBC04EBC974415B9A4AF172468FCE1E3D1895EE4A186FD90232032DF91AD4687F4133C7608047DC44FF22E84E568A06C9F679D8F3F7728BF9D2BADAB44","documentHash":"107b89cc-ea69-43a4-afb0-f819d7b423f4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1e9","doi":"10.3390/antiox13070766","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85199643512&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Dramatic suppression of lipogenesis and no increase in beta-oxidation gene expression are among the key effects of bergamot flavonoids in fatty liver disease","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bergamot flavonoids have been shown to prevent metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and stimulate autophagy in animal models and patients. To investigate further the mechanism of polyphenol-dependent effects, we performed a RT2-PCR array analysis on 168 metabolism, transport and autophagy-related genes expressed in rat livers exposed for 14 weeks to different diets: standard, cafeteria (CAF) and CAF diet supplemented with 50 mg/kg of bergamot polyphenol fraction (BPF). CAF diet caused a strong upregulation of gluconeogenesis pathway (Gck, Pck2) and a moderate (>1.7 fold) induction of genes regulating lipogenesis (Srebf1, Pparg, Xbp1), lipid and cholesterol transport or lipolysis (Fabp3, Apoa1, Lpl) and inflammation (Il6, Il10, Tnf). However, only one β-oxidation gene (Cpt1a) and a few autophagy genes were differentially expressed in CAF rats compared to controls. While most of these transcripts were significantly modulated by BPF, we observed a particularly potent effect on lipogenesis genes, like Acly, Acaca and Fasn, which were suppressed far below the mRNA levels of control livers as confirmed by alternative primers-based RT2-PCR analysis and western blotting. These effects were accompanied by downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Il6, Tnfa, and Il10) and diabetes-related genes. Few autophagy (Map1Lc3a, Dapk) and no β-oxidation gene expression changes were observed compared to CAF group. In conclusion, chronic BPF supplementation efficiently prevents NAFLD by modulating hepatic energy metabolism and inflammation gene expression programs, with no effect on β-oxidation, but profound suppression of de novo lipogenesis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d6878c28a04739db85"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art. no 766 (1-19)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1ee","6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1f1","6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1f2","6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1f3","6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1f4","5e7092d6878c28a04739db85","6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1f7","6773936cfdbe833e3d15d1f8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b9c0","mniswId":"1366","title":"Antioxidants","eissn":"2076-3921","websiteLink":"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants/imprint","documentHash":"fdb7a50d-af58-46b4-a0ad-93cd7eaa2f9a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hepatic steatosis","lipogenesis","Citrus bergamia","gene profiling","flavonoids","flavanones","lipid synthesis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060430513"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677286b6fdbe831015c8b3b7","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Szczepkowski","documentHash":"3ecd767c-44ad-4c6b-a84e-b5f1ae39f96d"},{"objectId":"677286b6fdbe831015c8b3b6","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Szczepkowska","documentHash":"c057c4b2-857f-4077-9768-913802d31ba3"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Judycka","uuid":"1BC4BF9E119F09531BF37A15CAB0B8930B3CEAD1AF40343466114BF77590C3D83197AC72C68511FBF2141C1C8BA5A439D9C46314ACF0CF765BCFB4F5151DB784","documentHash":"4562af07-7167-4f8c-8263-56fca5431f8e"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c11d3","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Liszewska","uuid":"EA4E7765292441C81E97367404642B87A2B7A34DB91FB484883F4C35C50680C7D539563830B13E5035405CD1EB59F6838DB14F82273F2FF27E245CE59F1A94ED","documentHash":"f7b22cdc-906e-40eb-8244-e583bce50b81"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a40","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Dietrich","uuid":"343890A86A171B3CF4DCC212604012207FA15F466B2B3EEEBDAE98B7B968A0A8F2EEF12CAE341C02833944BA387F7935D3E116CFE3F911843DFADCD34BA15BD2","documentHash":"93973a70-2b79-47b1-bb44-2c0b853a7a56"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Ciereszko","uuid":"8DDAA077AF44261DCF0520E5A544DC624790613E97D31A6E69866CA47B0BE48CA68261CB972862072612A15E8601DFB12A75BC79EB268AE20BF6FDE46BBDCFD3","documentHash":"4ffd62ff-6e05-41ff-9258-58db72ae7b17"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"677286b6fdbe831015c8b3b5","doi":"10.1016/j.aqrep.2024.101995","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85185767240&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Evaluation of the effects of glucose concentration in extender and sperm concentration in straw for cryopreservation of Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus) semen","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus) faces unique conservation challenges due to its extended maturation period and irregular spawning patterns, which restrict its reproductive capacity. Therefore, in order to overcome these difficulties we have made a first attempt to develop effective cryopreservation procedure for Atlantic sturgeon through evaluation of the effects of the glucose concentration in extender and final sperm concentration in straw on sperm motility parameters. A remarkably high (81 ± 8%) postthaw sperm motility was obtained. The other sperm velocity and trajectory parameters were differentially affected both by concentrations of glucose or sperm and cryopreservation process. Our results undoubtedly show that the post-thaw sperm motility of Atlantic sturgeon is highly influenced by the final glucose and sperm concentration. The recommended cryopreservation procedure includes 0.05 M glucose and 7.5% methanol at 1.0×109 spermatozoa ml−1. We have confirmed that our elaborated protocol can be used for cryopreservation of Atlantic sturgeon semen which can be subsequently used for long-term conservation of this endangered species, offering a valuable tool in efforts to safeguard its genetic diversity and contribute to its survival."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a40","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11d3","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"art. no 101995 (1-7)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f2","5e709410878c28a0473b5a40","677286b6fdbe831015c8b3b6","677286b6fdbe831015c8b3b7","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11d3","5e70940d878c28a0473b588b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d7a6","mniswId":"20992","title":"Aquaculture Reports","issn":"2352-5134","eissn":"2352-5134","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"99140b83-1678-4900-8f41-d6ce7d6e3541"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cryopreservation","Sperm concentration","Sperm motility parameters","Sturgeon"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060430524"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67765980fdbe833e69507b12","name":"Nasya B.","lastName":"Tomlekova","documentHash":"64fd285f-a883-4935-9211-a31de2d0e2bd"},{"objectId":"67765980fdbe833e69507b11","name":"Milen I.","lastName":"Georgiev","documentHash":"0664ac58-9f0d-40b1-a640-d55b92c90671"},{"objectId":"67765980fdbe833e69507b10","name":"Dida","lastName":"Iserliyska","documentHash":"10711048-7b3c-4fc1-b350-a0b3d89b606b"},{"objectId":"67765980fdbe833e69507b0f","name":"Andrey S.","lastName":"Marchev","documentHash":"ddd91115-f435-4b89-977e-d030f090c659"},{"objectId":"67765980fdbe833e69507b0e","name":"Teodora G.","lastName":"Yaneva","documentHash":"edd38135-0258-454a-8dd5-45b57eae317c"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Wiczkowski","uuid":"A445B60E2C80F5319C08EF716E136CD876DC26A2A64B90215992326CEC3E88C747A494DD05BCE2A7CEB5F7E02C4FB6FA78E34EA5D616429F09576334B9B3ED03","documentHash":"5674033e-a108-4b65-93d8-84a69c4a35e7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67765980fdbe833e69507b0d","doi":"10.3390/ijms25115638","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Evaluation of polyphenols synthesized in mature seeds of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) advanced mutant lines","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed to investigate the availability of flavonoids, anthocyanins, and phenolic acids in mutant bean seeds, focusing on M7 mutant lines, and their corresponding initial and local cultivars. HPLC-DAD-MS/MS and HPLC-MS/MS were used to analyze twenty-eight genotypes of common bean. The obtained results suggest that the mutations resulted in four newly synthesized anthocyanins in the mutant bean seeds, namely, delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside, and petunidin 3-O-glucoside, in 20 accessions with colored seed shapes out of the total of 28. Importantly, the initial cultivar with white seeds, as well as the mutant white seeds, did not contain anthocyanins. The mutant lines were classified into groups based on their colors as novel qualitative characteristics. Five phenolic acids were further quantified: ferulic, p-coumaric, caffeic, sinapic, and traces of chlorogenic acids. Flavonoids were represented by epicatechin, quercetin, and luteolin, and their concentrations in the mutant genotypes were several-fold superior compared to those of the initial cultivar. All mutant lines exhibited higher concentrations of phenolic acids and flavonoids. These findings contribute to the understanding of the genetics and biochemistry of phenolic accumulation and anthocyanin production in common bean seeds, which is relevant to health benefits and might have implications for common bean breeding programs and food security efforts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7db9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"art. no 5638 (1-23)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67765980fdbe833e69507b0e","5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","67765980fdbe833e69507b0f","67765980fdbe833e69507b10","67765980fdbe833e69507b11","67765980fdbe833e69507b12"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff3a4ad49b31ccec0afc1","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1661-6596","documentHash":"b3f80bff-4f92-4717-ba64-03a3ee02790b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)","anthocyanins","seed color","HPLC-MS/MS","EMS-induced mutagenesis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060430621"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b910c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ogrodowczyk","uuid":"D07F9EC28955A5934880501322D4ED21F7DAE4AAABEBBB6BE0F0B2AFE83F269D32B39654C2AE55DD88563058C23F771C86299989B6D6A395E89B84F903066998","documentHash":"4a448f66-2073-4e5a-b80e-d7f42561eb9a"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5b31","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Wasilewska","uuid":"BA98D5318EFEEE51897739A2B326B823C86644EEC0818026715F8DDC62B889E3F1A996E9AFDA76BF64104CDF6AAE4F5B04380482BC3936E5B1BE707E7ECD39FD","documentHash":"22bff37a-a334-4bf9-a249-e4060408ea4c"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5aef","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Wróblewska","uuid":"5DB03D00276FB168A632F58946904D68371579A788199D21A9EF92ED0D66A6CE10D4942D9186141FE9863E443F60CBF7B7368A38845839154002943427732A15","documentHash":"56465ee4-d650-4e09-bfd2-a0d6e9de84a5"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b590b","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Złotkowska","uuid":"4138A22D7BADB2C0318799405FEF8BAA2149319C25E04CF3C4457BD583B6D8C7EF619812D7F263ECFEE28685239A5A1667A83D1176EA6B132DFC889A9D59A3B7","documentHash":"7faae3c3-4236-427a-9590-e9dfbe9482f5"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b590a","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Markiewicz","uuid":"641156117C342608C0069AAAE52B733C9E732955D45D3B45010F4D12B5BCA17C637322945602B0A4FDD0E8D4E51EFB478C0C576F00494D553A0E404C8CDB4B49","documentHash":"8600e5e2-5c89-4dfe-a49e-52b7787ee80f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67765b3dfdbe833e69509071","doi":"10.3390/nu16203430","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Enhanced effect of β-lactoglobulin immunization in mice with mild intestinal deterioration caused by low-dose dextran sulphate sodium: a new experimental approach to allergy studies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Cow’s milk allergy is one of the most common food allergies in children, and its pathomechanism is still under investigation. Recently, an increasing number of studies have linked food allergy to intestinal barrier dysfunction. The present study aimed to investigate changes in the intestinal microenvironment during the development of β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) allergy under conditions of early intestinal dysfunction. Methods: BALB/c mice received intraperitoneal β-lg with Freund’s adjuvant, followed by oral β-lg while receiving dextran sulphate sodium salt (DSS) in their drinking water (0.2% w/v). The immunized group without DSS and the groups receiving saline, oral β-lg, or DSS served as controls. Results: The study showed that the immunization effect was greater in mice with mild intestinal barrier dysfunction. Although DSS did not affect the mice’s humoral response to β-lg, in combination with β-lg, it significantly altered their cellular response, affecting the induction and distribution of T cells in the inductive and peripheral tissues and the activation of immune mediators. Administration of β-lg to sensitized mice receiving DSS increased disease activity index (DAI) scores and pro-inflammatory cytokine activity, altered the distribution of claudins and zonulin 1 (ZO-1) in the colonic tissue, and negatively affected the balance and activity of the gut microbiota. Conclusions: The research model used appears attractive for studying food allergen sensitization, particularly in relation to the initial events leading to mucosal inflammation and the development of food hypersensitivity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b590b","5e70940f878c28a0473b590a","5e709442878c28a0473b910c","5e709411878c28a0473b5b31","5e709411878c28a0473b5aef"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"art. no 3430 (1-21)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940f878c28a0473b590b","5e70940f878c28a0473b590a","5e709442878c28a0473b910c","5e709411878c28a0473b5aef","5e709411878c28a0473b5b31"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","issn":"2072-6643","documentHash":"c19e39d9-34f9-43a7-9c35-a6b3e3ec2726"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cow’s milk protein allergy (CMPA)","mouse model","DSS-induced early intestinal barrier dysfunction","humoral and cellular response","immune mediators","microbiota activity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060430683"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59e8","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":"FFF1C302A4ED581F77AA01D5950E55F14D23CDBCDAD59F843C36670289FB7C56D37700578F5282A4A9F572D9B626394E4F8E70F38AD1BE8043807EDC54FA76BB","documentHash":"e11b06a4-6f92-4cb7-b88c-c8e09d0b50ab"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5890","name":"Robert","lastName":"Rękawiecki","uuid":"628735F54B973B38689AFE229955AB0F8A033305183D099551DBE361D4E670C2FEA0B2B0BF144AEDB81E2F41180B9BA1D5C72D5A91760FC1147F2824FC2D01B7","documentHash":"89c90d91-e466-457a-9ea0-32b253ea76e3"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afaa5","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Młynarczuk","uuid":"4DA291311B702E990D8DB235AB419AFFAFBF983457AD19DCA4F7B2658DD515E8A776861CA6F3B879E9AD3255BECA587D87865812AF36FBFBEF368518A528182A","documentHash":"fbf2bcf2-336f-4cc7-a5ad-6caeb5860ef9"}],"objectId":"67765905fdbe833e695072b6","doi":"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2024.01.030","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85184584379&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Effects of commonly used carbamates (carbaryl and thiram) on the regulatory, secretory and motor functions of bovine cervixes in vitro","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Previously studied classes of pesticides, including organochlorines, organophosphates and pyrethroids disturb the mechanism that causes bovine myometrial contractions. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of carbaryl and thiram, which are representative carbamate pesticides commonly used in global agriculture, on the motor and secretory functions of bovine cervixes. Additionally, the impacts of these pesticides on intra- and intercellular signaling in vitro were estimated. In this study, cervical cells or strips were obtained from cows at days 18–20 of the estrous cycle and were treated with carbaryl or thiram. Neither carbamate (10 or 100 ng/ml) exerted cytotoxic effects. Carbaryl increased the level of mRNA (at a dose of 0.1 ng/ml) and protein (at both doses, 1 and 10 ng/ml) expression for the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), while thiram (at 0.1 and 10 ng/ml or 0.1–10 ng/ml, respectively) caused the opposite effects. Moreover, the level of the second messenger inositol-trisphosphate (IP3) was decreased by carbaryl (10 ng/ml) but increased by thiram (10 ng/ml). Only thiram decreased prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2; 0.1 ng/ml) and aldo-keto reductase family 1, member B1 (AKR1B1; 0.1 ng/ml), and prostaglandin E synthase 2 (PTGES2; 0.1–10 ng/ml) mRNA expression, while thiram (0.1–10 ng/ml) and carbaryl (0.1 and 10 ng/ml) both decreased the release of PGF2α. Carbaryl (10 ng/ml) and thiram (10 ng/ml) also decreased the level of a gap junction protein (GAP). Moreover, carbaryl (10 ng/ml) decreased the level of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). However, the strength of cervical contractions was increased by thiram (1 and 10 ng/ml) but decreased by carbaryl (1 and 10 ng/ml). Carbaryl increased the receptivity of cervical cells to oxytocin (OXT), but inhibited further transduction (IP3) of this signal. Hence, direct inhibition of cervical strip contraction may occur. In contrast, thiram mostly decreased the receptivity of cervical cells to OXT, while it stimulated the contraction of cervical strips. Moreover, compared to carbaryl, thiram more greatly affected the synthesis and release of prostaglandins. These results suggest that carbaryl and thiram disturb OXT signaling, PG secretion and cervical contraction in vitro."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b59e8","5e7093b7878c28a0473afaa5","5e70940d878c28a0473b5890"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"218","pagesFromTo":"183-192","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709410878c28a0473b59e8","5e7093b7878c28a0473afaa5","5e70940d878c28a0473b5890"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479934","mniswId":"19490","title":"Theriogenology","issn":"0093-691X","eissn":"1879-3231","documentHash":"5a895e76-bf91-415f-9ad3-e560a5ae5bdf"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Carbamates","Cervix","Contractions","Cow","Pesticides"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060430738"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67729a23fdbe831015caa2ab","name":"Wim","lastName":"Dehaen","documentHash":"af519575-e794-409a-954e-fa37702ca5ec"},{"objectId":"67729a23fdbe831015caa2aa","name":"Mathias","lastName":"Daniels","documentHash":"edfa7815-5fe3-476c-bd32-af6d062b14f4"},{"objectId":"67729a23fdbe831015caa2a9","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Malecka-Baturo","documentHash":"06710fe6-b8bc-4031-aaf0-8d2a26cf9ddd"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be65b","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Malecka","uuid":"2F8CC52544EFF43CF1E76953D0C0586B2F6299566EAC63AF1564AECAE491CF49887F906BAE50EE4F0C2287067E86FA16A6F9909C6E782805D75E460FED4E7992","documentHash":"9ca0a361-4d78-44f4-a37a-05c162963f20"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be657","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Grabowska","uuid":"99E4EDA26D1AB0BBB99E0D5DBB59BA9C1CF38DA4C10C1EF6457AE972D5D0A5AF3B311AC06E20A64BD2505FEB1D770EB0E6F8F76F5A3AFA91BB9291924A395746","documentHash":"2b049818-67a3-4659-8d7c-ee0ddbffe8ef"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a99","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Radecka","uuid":"1E6638619DC22217061DFEF984278A4E8E30F289D1380FFD9D79722A5EFD1F1E3D0ECCA886FA20DD135C4C066225B089EE39FDCA83D332A3E75406966CFF15C3","documentHash":"17fcdc83-1cf7-4146-8a34-0e10ebd32a14"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5889","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Radecki","uuid":"66647A07B44175F0AC48FD9BCA8E6F0108235806C14446C458A9DCDE81419461786917797171239FBA4E930A7764D4F9FA79AB86014193B4E477089011784343","documentHash":"cf58e0dd-1d45-4fb3-8f09-0c2f380fcbc4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67729a23fdbe831015caa2a8","doi":"10.3390/molecules29092102","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Voltammetric sensing of chloride based on a redox-active complex: a terpyridine-Co(II)-dipyrromethene functionalized anion receptor deposited on a gold electrode","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A redox-active complex containing Co(II) connected to a terpyridine (TPY) and dipyrromethene functionalized anion receptor (DPM-AR) was created on a gold electrode surface. This host-guest supramolecular system based on a redox-active layer was used for voltammetric detection of chloride anions in aqueous solutions. The sensing mechanism was based on the changes in the redox activity of the complex observed upon binding of the anion to the receptor. The electron transfer coefficient (α) and electron transfer rate constant (k0) for the modified gold electrodes were calculated based on Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) experiments results. On the other hand, the sensing abilities were examined using Square Wave Voltammetry (SWV). More importantly, the anion receptor was selective to chloride, resulting in the highest change in Co(II) current intensity and allowing to distinguish chloride, sulfate and bromide. The proposed system displayed the highest sensitivity to Cl− with a limit of detection of 0.50 fM. The order of selectivity was: Cl− > SO42− > Br−, which was confirmed by the binding constants (K) and reaction coupling efficiencies (RCE)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940d878c28a0473b5889","5e70947f878c28a0473be657","5e70947f878c28a0473be65b","5e709410878c28a0473b5a99"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"art. no 2102 (1-12)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67729a23fdbe831015caa2a9","5e70947f878c28a0473be65b","67729a23fdbe831015caa2aa","67729a23fdbe831015caa2ab","5e709410878c28a0473b5a99","5e70940d878c28a0473b5889","5e70947f878c28a0473be657"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","documentHash":"8615ffac-9999-41cd-9658-bd5ed633cde5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["voltammetric sensor","anion recognition","host-guest interaction","terpyridine-Co(II)-dipyrromethene complex","chloride sensing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060430800"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67729c2cfdbe831015cab723","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jackowska","documentHash":"1ca1e67c-e1bb-43e7-b5ec-db07337d740a"},{"objectId":"67729c2cfdbe831015cab722","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Żółtowska","documentHash":"63cb8bfd-6683-4698-8633-f3eed4c807cf"},{"objectId":"67729c2cfdbe831015cab721","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Malecka-Baturo","documentHash":"a35240d8-d34c-4ddf-a433-f49da2123812"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be65b","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Malecka","uuid":"2F8CC52544EFF43CF1E76953D0C0586B2F6299566EAC63AF1564AECAE491CF49887F906BAE50EE4F0C2287067E86FA16A6F9909C6E782805D75E460FED4E7992","documentHash":"9ca0a361-4d78-44f4-a37a-05c162963f20"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be658","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kurzątkowska-Adaszyńska","uuid":"D1FFFD09C055DF4E1CABE6A5A0732B9C8948B66EC350DD4C68E49D1FE636059DE326B3F74CDB3AA362F4F85EB846C040C99905E2E8BD7F631FD32EFF5293EEF1","documentHash":"218a43f8-0d8d-49bd-83f2-7b4e1f4f335c"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be657","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Grabowska","uuid":"99E4EDA26D1AB0BBB99E0D5DBB59BA9C1CF38DA4C10C1EF6457AE972D5D0A5AF3B311AC06E20A64BD2505FEB1D770EB0E6F8F76F5A3AFA91BB9291924A395746","documentHash":"2b049818-67a3-4659-8d7c-ee0ddbffe8ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67729c2cfdbe831015cab720","doi":"10.3390/bios14020101","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85185856593&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Electrochemical Aptasensing Platform for the Detection of Retinol Binding Protein-4","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Here, we present the results of our the electrochemical aptasensing strategy for retinol binding protein-4 (RBP-4) detection based on a thiolated aptamer against RBP-4 and 6-mercaptohexanol (MCH) directly immobilized on a gold electrode surface. The most important parameters affecting the magnitude of the analytical signal generated were optimized: (i) the presence of magnesium ions in the immobilization and measurement buffer, (ii) the concentration of aptamer in the immobilization solution and (iii) its folding procedure. In this work, a systematic assessment of the electrochemical parameters related to the optimization of the sensing layer of the aptasensor was carried out (electron transfer coefficients (α), electron transfer rate constants (k0) and surface coverage of the thiolated aptamer probe (ΓApt)). Then, under the optimized conditions, the analytical response towards RBP-4 protein, in the presence of an Fe(CN)63−/4− redox couple in the supporting solution was assessed. The proposed electrochemical strategy allowed for RBP-4 detection in the concentration range between 100 and 1000 ng/mL with a limit of detection equal to 44 ng/mL based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The specificity studies against other diabetes biomarkers, including vaspin and adiponectin, proved the selectivity of the proposed platform. These preliminary results will be used in the next step to miniaturize and test the sensor in real samples."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej

Despite the rapid increase of research papers, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of the health benefits and risks of FF. The COST Action CA20128 “Promoting innovation of fermented foods” (PIMENTO) aims to provide a comprehensive assessment on the available evidence by compiling a set of 16 reviews. Seven reviews will cover clinical and biological endpoints associated with major health indicators across several organ systems, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, immune, and skeletal systems. Nine reviews will address broader biological questions associated with FF including bioactive compounds and vitamin production, nutrient bioavailability and bioaccessibility, the role of FF in healthy diets and personalized nutrition, food safety, regulatory practices, and finally, the health properties of novel and ethnic FF. For each outcome assessed in the reviews, an innovative approach will be adopted based on EFSA’s published guidance for health claim submissions. In particular, each review will be composed of three parts: (1) a systematic review of available human studies; (2) a non-systematic review of the mechanism of action related to the clinical endpoints measured by the human studies identified in part 1; and (3) a non-systematic review of the characterization of the FF investigated in the human studies identified in part 1. The evidence and research gaps derived from the reviews will be summarized and published in the form of a strategic road map that will pave the way for future research on FF."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709442878c28a0473b9106"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"art. no 1458536 (1-14)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67764f74fdbe833e694fdf55","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf56","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf57","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf58","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf59","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf5a","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf5b","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf5c","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf5d","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf5e","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf5f","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf60","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf61","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf62","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf63","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf64","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf65","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf66","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf67","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf68","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf69","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf6a","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf6b","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf6c","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf6d","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf6e","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf6f","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf70","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf71","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf72","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf73","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf74","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf75","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf76","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf77","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf78","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf79","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf7a","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf7b","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf7c","5e709442878c28a0473b9106","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf7d","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf7e","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf7f","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf80","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf81","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf82","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf83","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf84","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf85","67764f74fdbe833e694fdf86"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e72a052467f01e930e540e","title":"Frontiers in Nutrition","eissn":"2296-861x","websiteLink":"http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/nutrition","documentHash":"edb1dd78-fbdf-488b-9d2b-4e833c51f9ae"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fermented foods","food characterization","food safety","functional claims","health benefits","health claims","mechanism of action","systematic review"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060430835"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67739c5afdbe833e3d1673ec","name":"Alireza","lastName":"Fazeli","documentHash":"55d8f595-e6a4-4b2a-9d5d-025fda3ce5d3"},{"objectId":"67739c5afdbe833e3d1673eb","name":"Suranga","lastName":"Kodithuwakku","documentHash":"886d42d6-e575-4471-ae02-05ad3b29e2f1"},{"objectId":"67739c5afdbe833e3d1673ea","name":"Claudia","lastName":"Klein","documentHash":"08376a72-4c4b-49a8-a564-b430b3334015"},{"objectId":"67739c5afdbe833e3d1673e9","name":"Ants","lastName":"Kavak","documentHash":"351ff745-167e-47ed-bd2c-0070dde90157"},{"objectId":"67739c5afdbe833e3d1673e8","name":"Madhusha","lastName":"Prasadani","documentHash":"2a5623d3-90f6-4863-a5b2-8f820c3fe525"},{"objectId":"67739c5afdbe833e3d1673e7","name":"Andres","lastName":"Waldmann","documentHash":"6a62008a-e994-4407-8296-3bf6a5b35d3c"},{"objectId":"67739c5afdbe833e3d1673e6","name":"Johanna","lastName":"Piibor","documentHash":"156b0227-86f9-4a2d-a8ba-a096881ec612"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5af0","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Andronowska","uuid":"FED2FCAE6B5DD0135A4EFBF728ABE3CD84F3632BC016B99F64D43ACE18BE814653A6357A19ED098836C69D0922559315762EE4FC0E18D9A07A5470B86F46C8AA","documentHash":"3f8bf776-486a-4bde-953d-9dc774171f3e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67739c5afdbe833e3d1673e5","doi":"10.3390/biom14060626","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Investigation of uterine fluid extracellular vesicles’ proteomic profiles provides novel diagnostic biomarkers of bovine endometritis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cow uterine infections pose a challenge in dairy farming, resulting in reproductive disorders. Uterine fluid extracellular vesicles (UF-EVs) play a key role in cell-to-cell communication in the uterus, potentially holding the signs of aetiology for endometritis. We used mass spectrometry-based quantitative shotgun proteomics to compare UF-EV proteomic profiles in healthy cows (H), cows with subclinical (SE) or clinical endometritis (CLE) sampled at 28–35 days postpartum. Functional analysis was performed on embryo cultures with the exposure to different EV types. A total of 248 UF-EV proteins exhibited differential enrichment between the groups. Interestingly, in SE, EV protein signature suggests a slight suppression of inflammatory response compared to CLE-UF-EVs, clustering closer with healthy cows’ profile. Furthermore, CLE-UF-EVs proteomic profile highlighted pathways associated with cell apoptosis and active inflammation aimed at pathogen elimination. In SE-UF-EVs, the regulation of normal physiological status was aberrant, showing cell damage and endometrial repair at the same time. Serine peptidase HtrA1 (HTRA1) emerged as a potential biomarker for SE. Supplementation of CLE- and SE-derived UF-EVs reduced the embryo developmental rates and quality. Therefore, further research is warranted to elucidate the precise aetiology of SE in cattle, and HTRA1 should be further explored as a potential diagnostic biomarker."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5af0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"art. no 626 (1-18)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67739c5afdbe833e3d1673e6","67739c5afdbe833e3d1673e7","67739c5afdbe833e3d1673e8","67739c5afdbe833e3d1673e9","5e709411878c28a0473b5af0","67739c5afdbe833e3d1673ea","67739c5afdbe833e3d1673eb","67739c5afdbe833e3d1673ec"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bb75","mniswId":"2511","title":"BIOMOLECULES","issn":"2218-273X","eissn":"2218-273X","documentHash":"082af85b-4e0b-4366-8d22-3e6d94f1ecbe"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["endometritis","bovine uterine fluid","extracellular vesicles","proteomic changes","inflammation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060430893"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c120d","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Topolska","uuid":"ED6AEEFCDF3A4A51A3789757280F1B4D91423E0BA13FF3748DC4FBDE22EAABE1C03CEAD624CB15F181F2B1E8B29F7D411DFEC79E86C3E5B3A88E64B48FCE620C","documentHash":"3526422f-ff33-422e-8e18-07c5f27a6cc0"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c120c","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Bączek","uuid":"637E16C1658EDFF062FD7C045372ED2816EBDD7665FA8106FA0D3290461451C92D6BF340D799162F07D2D9C19F7C79E2F27CD587C62DA06813892B0301C39A2D","documentHash":"aa402877-5138-43d9-970c-b4d98ce24fe0"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c1209","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Honke","uuid":"609000AAB0B198C0630514E0655A55510D0C8F57030826C0DCEECD8B62655212B611E3260F1A6CE7E17C7D6AB695B3E697224039CFEEBCCB8C72E2B1354DDCF0","documentHash":"116cd03e-1a7c-4279-8fc5-89c40f1acd4a"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be65c","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wronkowska","uuid":"7AD9D7133FEED3901C208150BF6A4BEC80D1D5476AC1D8C3F2A1D6CC435EA47BBDE118C6497839B2A1CE9986E04B5B72B7E49A7CBCB10520840247E859D56212","documentHash":"cac22030-ab3d-4958-9588-afa00449da3c"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588a","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":"ACDF393EDD5617E052F030A01229E8428BB6016E08FDEE5C1E197E7D62E799573B6A7AEB725233560EB0788143DDD3D158DAC6D9162C1007A8B980A24A12C7D1","documentHash":"3517728d-3d41-4845-b4aa-3df0dd950582"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2024-07-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67765878fdbe833e69506e4d","doi":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2024.140645","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85199950518&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Retention of bioactive compounds during technological steps of the production of bread enriched with roasted buckwheat hulls","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The retention of bioactive compounds in the blend of wheat and rye flours and 4% roasted buckwheat hulls, dough before and after fermentation, and obtained bread were determined.

Fermented cabbage exhibited higher ability against AGEs, i.e., 17% in the bovine serum albumin–methylglyoxal (BSA-MGO) model and 25% in the BSA–glucose model, while beetroot exhibited 23% and 18%, respectively. The major compounds of cabbage products were cyanidin 3-(sinapoyl)(sinapoyl)-diglucoside-5-glucoside, sinapic acid, and epicatechin. Syringic acid and epicatechin were predominantly present in fermented beetroot. 2,17-bidecarboxy- and 2,15,17-tridecarboxy-betanin were the major betalains. Fermented vegetables can be effective inhibitors of the AGE formation/accumulation and could be recommended in the prevention of diet-related diseases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","5faa9659085dcb5a2b98d905","5e7094a8878c28a0473c120c","5e709442878c28a0473b9106","6776481efdbe833e694f9605","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c25"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art. no 1791 (1-16)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709442878c28a0473b9106","5faa9659085dcb5a2b98d905","5e7094a8878c28a0473c120c","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c25","6776481efdbe833e694f9605","5e709430878c28a0473b7db9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"FOODS","issn":"2304-8158","websiteLink":"https://doi.org/10.3390/foods8100467","documentHash":"ef1a9e8c-2661-4476-b116-692933ac116b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["AGEs","red beetroot","red cabbage","glycation inhibitors","phytochemicals","technological processes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060430940"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ad5dc640970728ba31dbbd","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Antushevich","documentHash":"1c5007cd-d671-4404-8ca3-5a17231171e0"},{"objectId":"5e709486878c28a0473bef9d","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Bochenek","uuid":"0BE42062CBCB51B1E4A080A14ABD871F4DA16E739F85FDDB8C4ED4AF74AD346E7365B863E227F5C20864C8B776F578F7DC8B3E4BD72E10B7CBA979AB2D705598","orcidId":"0000-0002-0821-0059","documentHash":"3492c917-1e55-482b-81ce-7c581e89bdec"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7efb","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Szczepkowska","uuid":"591ADFA5337A5D2ACB452BAF1F5E958C136F5891B620057082EB0FFAFB8EBA6C21161FDCA733616AB62C4569074CDE182E2A19B9143181AFD8351CAEDFC91B6E","documentHash":"cf9d1f3d-0fcc-4382-afe0-598aac577690"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb5f","name":"Janina","lastName":"Skipor-Lahuta","uuid":"AA724EDE17E2E4B56910873DA2FED96847785EEF58C0F7E631335884DBE0EB37D073948D9E329ECB1EFB0252CBB9819324163E001895A800F18B77DAB0791A7E","documentHash":"b6141cd1-075b-45e4-abfd-efa6896b8d6b"},{"objectId":"5e709390878c28a0473ace50","name":"Monika","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":"1962FE31D0697C083D320B9BA36D9288F909270EDF08C908C244A29B1EDD9A4F3C3F301C4A7D4CE48ADC7AE75837049D1A05B617878D80A417DDC86F9E6D83EB","orcidId":"0000-0002-6260-4024","documentHash":"ecf86fd0-0d38-40d8-91e3-37a3ee2944ed"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abf8e","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"7C7DB56EACC64BEF071F72F75FC121BB060E92A2669A250254946C2F598E519987FD8299725104764005738CEBF6737603A8AB6BD25A27F21581657A8550FA4D","orcidId":"0000-0001-8928-2662","documentHash":"2f6d9339-a840-49b1-9cc5-d55804b5719c"},{"objectId":"5e709289878c28a047397821","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Herman","uuid":"2C04C90987C1859F4CE998E9F5CA5263B8A789EB3DDA160E9F34F380B5A46D31971D3F09F4836BE01777E5C5EF56F1A5DA8AA30BD891BE9FF699377B7E4A0864","orcidId":"0000-0003-4116-6309","documentHash":"b6d159e6-7697-4dc6-9655-827513ff2c0f"},{"objectId":"5e709289878c28a047397809","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Tomaszewska-Zaremba","uuid":"6A65D55A58102588A2A002803A8A1A0FC57059E27A7263D4E84EB8C693F509CB5139C65233DF0D6C6730ED72B5AED229DBCABDB017E5B092936C9A25CF715D5C","orcidId":"0000-0002-2619-4638","documentHash":"2a0f9396-1960-45b8-a9b7-a127e45a1ad3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-12-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ad5dc640970728ba31dbb9","doi":"10.22358/jafs/156762/2022","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Effect of caffeine on adenosine and ryanodine receptor gene expression in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and choroid plexus in ewes under basal and LPS challenge conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Caffeine is a plant alkaloid that stimulates the central nervous system. It easily crosses the blood-brain barrier located in the endothelial cells of brain microvessels and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier located in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus (ChP). Caffeine exerts most of its biological effects by antagonising adenosine receptors (ADORs), but is also an agonist of ryanodine receptors (RYRs). A recent study in a sheep model has suggested that the effect of caffeine on the expression of many genes may depend on the animal’s immune status. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the effect of caffeine administration (iv, 30 mg/kg) in ewes, under basal and acute inflammatory conditions induced by lipopolysaccharide injection (iv, 400 ng/kg), on the expression of ADOR and RYR genes in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), anterior pituitary (AP), and ChP. Our study showed that among caffeineinteracting receptors, ADORA1 was the most highly expressed in the AP and ChP, while ADORA3 in the MBH. Caffeine reduced (P < 0.05) the inhibitory effect of inflammation on ADORA1, but only in the MBH, and decreased (P < 0.05) the stimulatory effect of endotoxin treatment on ADORA2B in the MBH and ChP. In contrast to ADORs, the expression of RYRs was less sensitive to the effects of inflammation and caffeine. We showed that caffeine influenced the expression of its receptor genes in the brain, but this effect seemed to be tissuedependent and could be affected by the immune status of the animals. However, the physiological implications of these results require further detailed studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709431878c28a0473b7efb","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb5f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea4","uid":"bdue8IYFHJjfPMqPlXSYxbA","uuid":"30312732-6777-4ca9-84e6-ad3f07bc18c2","name":"Instytut Fizjologii i Żywienia Zwierząt im.

natural light conditions, were investigated. The presence of fifteen derivatives of cyanidin, petunidin, and delphinidin was found. Changes in the content of each anthocyanin in the leaves before and after exposure to light on the abaxial (naturally upper) and adaxial (naturally lower) sides of the leaves were compared. When the adaxial side was exposed to light, the anthocyanin contents of the leaves did not change. In contrast, when the abaxial side of detached leaves was exposed to light, there was enhanced accumulation of delphinidin-rhamnoside-glucoside, cyanidin-rhamnoside-glucoside, cyanidin-glucoside-glucoside, and two unknown derivatives of petunidin and delphinidin. Application of methyl jasmonate (JA-Me) on the abaxial side exposed to light inhibited the accumulation of these anthocyanins. This effect could probably be due to the presence of these anthocyanins in the epidermal cells of K. blossfeldiana leaves and was visible in the microscopic view of its cross-section. These anthocyanins were directly exposed to JA-Me, leading to inhibition of their formation and/or accumulation. The lack of significant effects of JA-Me on anthocyanin mono- and tri-glycosides may indicate that they are mainly present in the mesophyll tissue of the leaf."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

This study tested the hypothesis that neurosteroids can affect PRL secretion in sheep under basal, stressful and advanced pregnancy conditions. In Experiment 1, luteal-phase sheep were subjected to a three-day series of intracerebroventricular (icv.) control (n = 12) or allopregnanolone (AL, 4 × 15 μg/60 μL/30 min at 30-min intervals, n = 12) infusions. Acute stressful stimuli, isolation and partial movement restriction were applied on the third day of infusion to half of the animals in each group. In Experiment 2, pregnant sheep were subjected to a three-day series of icv. control (n = 6) or finasteride (4 × 25 μg/60 μL/30 min at 30-min intervals, n = 6) infusions during the 16th week of pregnancy. As a result, the relative abundance of PRL transcript increased in the AP of luteal-phase sheep treated with stress, AL and AL in combination with stress (P < 0.05 - P < 0.01) compared to controls. The level of PRL mRNA in stressed-AL-treated sheep was higher (P < 0.01) than in sheep only subjected to stress. The PRL protein content in the AP decreased in stressed-only sheep compared to controls (P < 0.05) and increased in stressed-AL-treated sheep compared to controls and other groups (P < 0.05 - P < 0.01). Plasma PRL concentration increased (P < 0.05 - P < 0.01) in stressed-only sheep compared to controls; AL infusion counteracted the stress-induced increase in PRL levels (P < 0.05 - P < 0.01) and had no effect in non-stressed animals. Inhibition of neurosteroid synthesis in the brain of pregnant sheep by finasteride caused transient increases (P < 0.05 - P < 0.001) in plasma PRL concentration compared to controls. In conclusion, the presented results indicate a bimodal effect of AL on PRL secretion in sheep: first at the molecular level – stimulation of PRL mRNA expression; second – inhibition of hormone release from pituitary lactotrophs.

On d\r\n21 (Experiment 1) and d 56 (Experiment 2), 8 birds\r\nfrom each subgroup were killed, and the ileal and cecal\r\ndigesta were sampled to analyze the activity of bacterial\r\nenzymes and the concentrations of short-chain fatty\r\nacids (SCFA).

The continuous adminis-\r\ntration of monensin throughout the rearing period\r\nresulted in a weaker gastrointestinal response in older\r\nbirds, compared with the other 2 antibiotics adminis-\r\ntered for the first 5 d of life.

in plants by inhibiting the conversion of phytoene to phytofluene. Fluridone also indirectly inhibits the biosynthesis of abscisic acid and strigolactones, and therefore, our study indirectly addresses the effect of reduced ABA on the roots and leaf buds development in stem cuttings of Salix babylonica L. ‘Tortuosa’. The stem cuttings were kept in distilled water (control) or in a solution of fluridone (10 mg/L) in natural greenhouse light and temperature conditions. During the experiments, morphological observations were carried out on developing roots and leaf buds, as well as their appearance and growth. After three weeks of continuous treatments, adventitious roots and leaf buds were collected and analysed. Identification and analysis of anthocyanins were carried out using micro-HPLC-MS/MS-TOF, while HPLC-MS/MS was used to analyse phenolic acids, flavonoids and salicinoids. The fluridone applied significantly inhibited root growth, but the number or density of roots was higher compared to the control. Contents of salicortin and salicin were several dozen times higher in leaf buds than in roots of willow. Fluridone increased the content of salicortin in roots and leaf buds and declined the level of salicin in buds. Fluridone also declined the content of most anthocyanins in roots but enhanced their content in buds, especially cyanidin glucoside, cyanidin galactoside and cyanidin rutinoside. Besides, fluridone markedly decreased the level of chlorophylls and carotenoids in the leaf buds. The results indicate that applied fluridone solution reduced root growth, caused bleaching of leaf buds, and markedly affected the content of secondary metabolites in the adventitious roots and leaf buds of S. babylonica stem cuttings. The paper presents and discusses in detail the significance of fluridone’s effects on physiological processes and secondary metabolism."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a047398513"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709224878c28a047390822"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","60c33d8b9543c7233654421a","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c25"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

NPA substantially induced stem swelling at and above the application site and sti-mulated vascular cambium activity around the area of its application. The cambial zone in the swelling part of the stem was twice as wide as that treated with lanolin only (control). The proliferation of cambial cells increased xylem production and, consequently, vascular bundle thickness. A significant enlargement of parenchymatous pith cells and an increased diameter of the pith were also observed. Comprehensive phytohormone analyses revealed that NPA increased the content of indole-3-propionic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, and indole-3-acetyl-aspartic acid in the swelling part of the stem, as well as trans-zeatin riboside. These results suggest that NPA-induced stem swelling depends on the dynamics of changes in aux-in and cytokinin metabolites. Furthermore, the contents of monosaccharides (glucose, fructose and galactose) as well as malic, succinic, fumaric acids, cyclitols and quinic acid derivatives increased markedly in the swelling stem. This may indicate that the site of NPA-induced stem swel-ling is a physiological sink for polar metabolites needed for the growth of this tissue. Thus, it seems that auxins, in interaction with cytokinins, regulate the strength of the sink, controlling the transport of polar metabolites into the swelling part of S. canadensis

in sperm metabolome during carp sperm short-term storage in different media: In search of sperm quality and storage capability markers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Although short-term hypothermic storage of sperm is already widely used in artificial fish reproduction and is considered very useful for resolving multiple problems related to logistics and broodstock maintenance, this approach continues to be explored and developed. In the present study, targeted and global metabolome LC/MS analyses of common carp sperm during refrigerated storage in undiluted and diluted (in a buffer: NaCl 55 mmol/L, KCl 40 mmol/L, CaCl2 1 mmol/L, MgSO4 0.5 mmol/L, sucrose 87.5 mmol/L, Tris 10 mmol/L, pH 8, with or without 5% methanol) conditions were used to find potential metabolic markers of fish sperm quality and storage capability evaluated by sperm motility parameters. Sperm motility percentage started to decline from the 6th day of the storage, followed by a significant drop in ATP content in all studied groups, ADP content in undiluted sperm, and creatine phosphate content in sperm diluted by the methanol-containing buffer. Correlation analysis of whole metabolome and sperm motility data allowed us to suggest several potential markers belonging to different chemical classes (mainly nucleotides and their components). Considering motility preservation and changes in the content of proposed markers of sperm quality/storage ability, sperm storage in the methanol-containing buffer is more promising for further application. At the same time, further searches for reliable markers and their validation remain necessary."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a3e","60bedaea9543c7233654326a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"581","pagesFromTo":"art. no 740381 (1-10)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677276a2fdbe831015c7282e","677276a2fdbe831015c7282f","677276a2fdbe831015c72830","677276a2fdbe831015c72831","677276a2fdbe831015c72832","5e709410878c28a0473b5a3e","60bedaea9543c7233654326a","677276a2fdbe831015c72833"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547715a","mniswId":"1539","title":"Aquaculture","issn":"0044-8486","eissn":"1873-5622","documentHash":"aaff1260-3172-4786-b919-d851b47a7a44"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Common carp","Semen metabolome","Short-term storage","Sperm motility","Sperm quality markers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060773773"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67727a12fdbe831015c77295","name":"Monika","lastName":"Bugno-Poniewierska","documentHash":"f2d0879f-d307-4531-8efc-a090af974ce5"},{"objectId":"67727a12fdbe831015c77294","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kochan","documentHash":"9427f034-5a04-420a-83d3-198fd9fe65df"},{"objectId":"67727a12fdbe831015c77293","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Wojciechowska-Puchałka","documentHash":"d6340e58-b269-4b19-b304-5ae6734070b2"},{"objectId":"67727a12fdbe831015c77292","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Kucharski","documentHash":"a8e8578c-e068-4746-9f52-e68299572e46"},{"objectId":"67727a12fdbe831015c77290","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Kij-Mitka","documentHash":"5a060f40-df3c-405a-8bf6-cb82920077db"},{"objectId":"67727a12fdbe831015c7728f","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szmatoła","documentHash":"968403d3-4af8-4baf-93db-c15dea889552"},{"objectId":"67727a12fdbe831015c7728e","name":"Artur","lastName":"Gurgul","documentHash":"a4754a99-77ed-4532-841e-e1e67811e8da"},{"objectId":"67727a12fdbe831015c7728d","name":"Julia","lastName":"Gabryś","documentHash":"3ccba366-d572-4f0e-89be-34b4b907a86d"},{"objectId":"5e70944e878c28a0473ba134","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Karnas","uuid":"33243DC243475EFAC478EBD29601D0DFCA92A26E03EAF419A20A96737BBA7C2D4CD024DF8659FC36EF93DC578F09783E3428C8659A51FA1572EBCE1246B80422","documentHash":"193f3f36-cc7c-42a1-b81f-bd3775873ee2"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5af0","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Andronowska","uuid":"FED2FCAE6B5DD0135A4EFBF728ABE3CD84F3632BC016B99F64D43ACE18BE814653A6357A19ED098836C69D0922559315762EE4FC0E18D9A07A5470B86F46C8AA","documentHash":"3f8bf776-486a-4bde-953d-9dc774171f3e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67727a12fdbe831015c7728c","doi":"10.3390/ijms25063262","publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/handle/item/331860","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Follicular fluid-derived extracellular vesicles influence on in vitro maturation of equine oocyte : impact on cumulus cell viability, expansion and transcriptome","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cumulus cell (CC) expansion is pivotal for oocyte maturation, during which CCs release factors that initiate paracrine signaling within the follicular fluid (FF). The FF is abundant in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that facilitate intercellular communication. Although bovine and murine EVs can control cumulus expansion, these effects have not been observed in equines. This study aimed to assess the impact of FF-derived EVs (ffEVs) on equine CC expansion, viability, and transcriptome. Cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs) that underwent in vitro maturation (IVM) in the presence (200 µg protein/mL) or absence (control) of ffEVs were assessed for cumulus expansion and viability. CCs were isolated after 12 h of IVM, followed by RNA extraction, cDNA library generation, and subsequent transcriptome analysis using next-generation sequencing. Confocal microscopy images illustrated the internalization of labeled ffEVs by CCs. Supplementation with ffEVs significantly enhanced cumulus expansion in both compacted (Cp, p < 0.0001) and expanded (Ex, p < 0.05) COCs, while viability increased in Cp groups (p < 0.01), but decreased in Ex groups (p < 0.05), compared to the controls. Although transcriptome analysis revealed a subtle effect on CC RNA profiles, differentially expressed genes encompassed processes (e.g., MAPK and Wnt signaling) potentially crucial for cumulus properties and, consequently, oocyte maturation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet

of anthocyanins in detached leaves and in excised stems of Kalanchoë blossfeldiana kept under natural light conditions in the presence or absence of methyl jasmonate (JA-Me) was investigated. When the abaxial surface of detached leaves was held lower than the adaxial surface (the normal or natural position) under natural light conditions, anthocyanins were not accumulated on the abaxial side of the leaves. In contrast, when the adaxial surface of detached leaves was held lower than the abaxial surface (inverted position), anthocyanins were highly accumulated on the abaxial side of the leaves. These phenomena were independent of the growth stage of K. blossfeldiana as well as photoperiod. Application of JA-Me in lanolin paste significantly inhibited anthocyanin accumulation induced on the abaxial side of detached leaves held in an inverted position in a dose-dependent manner. Anthocyanin accumulation in the excised stem in response to natural light was also significantly inhibited by JA-Me in lanolin paste. Possible mechanisms of anthocyanin accumulation on the abaxial side of detached K. blossfeldiana leaves held in an inverted position under natural light conditions and the inhibitory effect of JA-Me on this process are described. The accompanying changes in the content of primary metabolites and histological analyses were also described."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w

the impact of extracellular vesicle addition during IVM on the fertilization rate of equine oocytes following ICSI","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The efficacy of in vitro embryo production (IVEP) in equines is relatively limited compared to other species due to the lack of a reliable superovulation technique, limited availability of cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs), low in vitro oocyte maturation (IVM) and fertilization rates. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are nanoparticles involved in intercellular signaling in the ovarian environment, have shown potential as supplements to improve oocyte development during IVM. This study tested the hypothesis that EVs from small (< 20 mm) ovarian follicles could enhance fertilization rates in mares. Follicular fluid was collected postmortem, and EVs were isolated and characterized. The IVM process was conducted with or without EVs (200 µg EV protein/ml). EV internalization during IVM was examined using fluorescent labeling and confocal microscopy. Following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), presumptive zygotes were cultured in a time-lapse system. Confocal microscopy confirmed EV internalization by COCs. Nanoparticle tracking analysis showed that obtained EVs were submicron-sized, and flow cytometry identified surface markers CD81 and CD63 on a subpopulation of EVs. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the characteristic disk shape of EV isolates. After culture, 196 oocytes (36.84 %) exhibited a first polar body and were subjected to ICSI. The EV-treated group showed a significantly higher fertilization rate (34.7 % vs. 20.2 %; P < 0.05), reduced degeneration, and increased cleavage efficiency (P < 0.1). Despite early embryonic arrest in both groups, these results suggest that follicular fluid-derived EVs could play a supportive role in equine IVF procedures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5af0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944e878c28a0473ba134"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"4","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67727cc4fdbe831015c78f0e","67727cc4fdbe831015c78f0f","67727cc4fdbe831015c78f10","5e709411878c28a0473b5af0","67727cc4fdbe831015c78f12","67727cc4fdbe831015c78f13","67727cc4fdbe831015c78f14","5e70944e878c28a0473ba134"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479508","mniswId":"17197","title":"Reproductive Biology","issn":"1642-431X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"fc62aa62-e33b-4e1f-846b-c39a12bf1c46"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cumulus-oocyte complex","ICSI","extracellular vesicles","mare","follicular fluid"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060839712"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67feb108fdbe837d214c7acf","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Zielinska","documentHash":"0a223973-6f32-4337-a794-2323297cbadc"},{"objectId":"67feb108fdbe837d214c7ace","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Lustofin","documentHash":"419b3ea4-f41a-4683-85b5-ff9655c0da97"},{"objectId":"67feb108fdbe837d214c7acd","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kotula-Balak","documentHash":"2f7952d0-b5e5-4491-be8c-3b8ee7bc0086"},{"objectId":"67feb108fdbe837d214c7acc","name":"Anna J.","lastName":"Korzekwa","documentHash":"64a9c614-9345-45b4-b75d-33de5880134d"},{"objectId":"665463e84097070e71c73984","name":"Malgorzata","lastName":"Kotula-Balak","documentHash":"2b9d39b2-2ddc-4e64-a3ea-7d47affb2bd0"},{"objectId":"665463e84097070e71c73983","name":"Beata","lastName":"Kusnierz-Cabala","documentHash":"1e654a94-459f-4ecf-8d82-627e30f85d60"},{"objectId":"665463e84097070e71c73981","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Krakowska","documentHash":"3c5b4015-74c4-40cb-b171-eeb333780a14"},{"objectId":"665463e84097070e71c7397f","name":"Bartosz J.","lastName":"Płachno","documentHash":"25d2dd66-ccdb-4dcc-9931-46ba9ada422e"},{"objectId":"665463e84097070e71c7397d","name":"Jan K.","lastName":"Wolski","documentHash":"38bf4707-22a2-49a5-a532-66bb9bae8a9e"},{"objectId":"5e70942b878c28a0473b77e3","name":"Marta","lastName":"Zarzycka","uuid":"56D6A55B3242610B93F5ABE534CCE24C4F8385AA5E0BE679776339555350AE57A3D9E61C3F4D460B907B1F688215AB9698AEA015701BD7BB543E75151519D166","documentHash":"06f42b40-1737-4f0f-83c7-958f27049480"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af611","name":"Anna","lastName":"Korzekwa","uuid":"6CCA76174E9BF1DF35E4C1E90E2B3B9D78AF9BDADC1E212FB54879C770E920DAC45DD70A8F63FE965B8949684CD8F8490ACB631BBDD818E2C1FDBAC1061F4362","documentHash":"f996b0b0-de34-42e8-8338-b6cd4d848669"},{"objectId":"5e709322878c28a0473a36a2","name":"Beata","lastName":"Kuśnierz-Cabala","uuid":"B00BC7DB8E7DB7A71BE65F65310DCF4C29010709D411676D86BEDA11DBF505E51B26C3EFD9F04ECBF4E3EF7DAE715DDA7FE8553F7B743C8DD05DB622001F21E9","documentHash":"bb5bd897-203c-488f-bc4e-f2d93341638a"},{"objectId":"5e709316878c28a0473a2b9a","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Płachno","uuid":"CCFB3DE43F04E18BCC5FC2CACA53B095974FCC24E64AEF176EB1D85629CA83E9FF973F25189822EB6C8C02B209D99CEA82E9652D30EFAEF2C1625E684FBDD7E8","orcidId":"0000-0001-5579-5101","documentHash":"f0a11b6d-bd5d-4106-a28e-1d774e48d83d"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1ea4","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Zielińska","uuid":"109427FABE6620D0B329A02366186D80AD45DC69523C7A7224480CEA50739128FAE89164915F9717B92E01F330718BCF71A44522FE14792097FF7387BAB23FB8","orcidId":"0000-0003-0090-5486","documentHash":"8a4a61e8-6de0-46e3-83d4-87089b575c96"}],"objectId":"665463e84097070e71c7397c","doi":"10.1016/j.repbio.2024.100890","publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/handle/item/339799","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Human benign Leydig cell tumor -

season","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mature males of a wild boar-pig crossbreed, during the long and short day season, were used\nfor the study which demonstrates that the chemical light carrier CO regulates the expression\nof biological clock genes in the hypothalamus via humoral pathways. Autologous blood with\nexperimentally elevated concentrations of endogenous CO (using lamps with white light-emitting\ndiodes) was infused into the ophthalmic venous sinus via the right dorsal nasal vein. Molecular\nbiology methods: qPCR and Western Blot were used to determine the expression of genes and\nbiological clock proteins. The results showed that elevated endogenous CO levels, through blood\nirradiation, induces changes in genes expression involved in the functioning of the main biological clock located in suprachiasmatic nuclei. Changes in the expression of the transcription factors\nBmal1, Clock and Npas2 have a similar pattern in both structures, where a very large decrease\nin gene expression was shown after exposure to elevated endogenous CO levels. The changes in\nthe gene expression of PER 1-2, CRY 1-2, and REV-ERB α-β and ROR β are not the same for both\nPOA and DH hypothalamic structures, indicating that both structures respond differently to the\nhumoral signal received.\nThe results indicate that CO is a chemical light molecule whose production in an organism\ndepends on the amount of light. An adequate amount of light is an essential factor for the proper\nfunctioning of the main biological clock."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709229878c28a047390dca","5e709216878c28a04738fbb0","5e709217878c28a04738fbde","5e709214878c28a04738fa40"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb73","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c5d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"65-82","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c5d","644a806040970752da5a9693","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb73","5e709217878c28a04738fbde","5e709216878c28a04738fbb0","5e709229878c28a047390dca","5e709214878c28a04738fa40"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479304","mniswId":"16307","title":"Polish Journal of Veterinary Sciences","issn":"1505-1773","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"6493c656-34eb-493d-bb3a-a6bc8a87a32a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"642bd0284097077d1441e9fe","year":"2023","volume":"26","number":"1","documentHash":"f084b00f-bcbc-42b9-b1cc-eaa796afbe02"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["carbon monoxide","humoral pathway","light","master biological clock","seasonal"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060959546"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66056263409707626337f641","name":"Teresa ","lastName":"Kamińska-Gibas","documentHash":"e73cd57c-93d6-4729-8d5f-111a8cdc45b9"},{"objectId":"66056263409707626337f640","name":"Krzysztof ","lastName":"Urbański","documentHash":"14a7a1ca-a150-4eff-86bb-f2f5e74c878f"},{"objectId":"66056263409707626337f63f","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Hofman","documentHash":"7044866e-dc7f-4e86-9131-a423bd0bb161"},{"objectId":"66056263409707626337f63d","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Szała","documentHash":"6c9e1513-be9a-420f-9c5d-895516b05de1"},{"objectId":"5e709316878c28a0473a2a0d","name":"Artur","lastName":"Osikowski","uuid":"7244D092DF8E17DF71E6E95AC6E16B57B89138EA20B4BD4CCAD2C4CBC5DA1104DB9356711F509B6A9F67BE22EFF4DC5B8EFDF615F769AA0835924D96BDCD3501","orcidId":"0000-0001-6646-2687","documentHash":"07c38672-0bb9-4b09-9f8a-0d35440dc68e"},{"objectId":"5e7092cb878c28a04739cbc0","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Bojarski","uuid":"68458F2D3E47656D64ABC7507323AF414003C37064BC2AA264E4E90FA6F0558EC9F88A43BBD101BE54380385405ED1E4E401F4C19A4BCE7804558DDE85B9D1D8","documentHash":"dae06fcd-c0a6-4f25-8eff-b5e304ac0110"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a047397583","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Rombel-Bryzek","uuid":"C231CEEFCDD4C9AF9ACE273D2B021CDFD3F6F5A17B977DB349A9DD5832DE521A7F714F4EE16420E8DD991CA0E96A952D39CE8C230E5A30B3B81CDAB4BBFE61FB","orcidId":"0000-0001-8790-3541","documentHash":"f2255ded-e70f-46d1-a420-ffda859aefb7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6553195a40970749a8e6ebfc","doi":"10.3409/fb_71-3.15","publicUri":"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/isez/fb/2023/00000071/00000003/art00004;jsessionid=a7paifk23so90.x-ic-live-03","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Effects of an MCPA-based herbicide formulation on the common carp Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758 – haematological, biochemical and histological evaluation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Herbicides (weed control agents) are used in crops on a massive scale. MCPA (2-methyl-4-chlorophen-oxyacetic acid) is a herbicide used to control weeds in cereals and other crops. The aim of this study was to investigate the toxic effects of an MCPA-based herbicide formulation (Chwastox Extra ® 300 SL) in the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). The fish were exposed for 10 days, to a concentration which corresponded to 1 mg/l or 5 mg/l of MCPA. Our analysis showed fluctuations of the haematological parameters during the treatment. Plasma biochemical changes that were statistically significant, i.e. a decrease of the total protein concentration and alanine aminotransferase activity, were observed after 1 day of exposure. No histopathological lesions in the gills, trunk kidney and liver were identified. The results of the present study indicate that Chwastox Extra ® 300 SL has a relatively low toxicity for the common carp. It was also observed that the blood indices were more sensitive to the tested herbicide formulation than the microstructure of the selected organs. Further research aimed at studying the effects of Chwastox on water invertebrates and fish of other taxa is recommended"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności

profiling of mare endometrium at different stages of endometrosis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the current study, transcriptome profiles of mare endometrium, classified into categories I, IIA, and IIB according to Kenney and Doig, were compared using RNA sequencing, analyzed, and functionally annotated using in silico analysis. In the mild stage (IIA) of endometrosis compared to category I endometrium, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were annotated to inflammation, abnormal metabolism, wound healing, and quantity of connective tissue. In the moderate stage (IIB) of endometrosis compared to category I endometrium, DEGs were annotated to inflammation, fibrosis, cellular homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and pregnancy disorders. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) identified cytokines such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and IL-17 as upstream regulators of DEGs associated with cellular homeostasis, metabolism, and fibrosis signaling pathways. In vitro studies showed the effect of these cytokines on DEGs such as ADAMTS1, -4, -5, -9, and HK2 in endometrial fibroblasts at different stages of endometrosis. The effect of cytokines on ADAMTS members’ gene transcription in fibroblasts differs according to the severity of endometrosis. The identified transcriptomic changes associated with endometrosis suggest that inflammation and metabolic changes are features of mild and moderate stages of endometrosis. The changes of ADAMTS-1, -4, -5, -9, in fibrotic endometrium as well as in endometrial fibroblast in response to TGF-β1, IL-4, IL-13, and IL-17 suggest the important role of these factors in the development of endometrosis. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c33bff9543c723365441d3","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11bf","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892","5e70945e878c28a0473bb8c4","5e70940d878c28a0473b5894","617a0b297523400564d4b4ac"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"66d90292ece3980cc87bb775","uid":"bs2oBBXSJ_LqYZZ63Yv7J7A","uuid":"7847e09c-18f2-47c0-aa78-7389c9de127a","name":"Wydział Medycyny Weterynaryjnej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739adb8","5e709439878c28a0473b872c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e089","uid":"bxHCtILZYY8pW7S8fOkWkJQ","uuid":"7752bc98-48af-470c-82a0-9804ab0fbe41","name":"Wydział Hodowli i Biologii Zwierząt","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739adb8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art. no 16263 (1-16)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f4878c28a0473b3eaf","60c33bff9543c723365441d3","5e70945e878c28a0473bb8c4","5e70940d878c28a0473b5894","617a0b297523400564d4b4ac","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11bf","5e709439878c28a0473b872c","5e7092b1878c28a04739adb8","5e709229878c28a047390eab","676e8cfbfdbe8322e23ca0db","5e70940d878c28a0473b5892"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e72c172467f01e931097bc","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"1053-8100","documentHash":"46b51ef7-40cf-4a0a-bec7-7c4781b52d4e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747433578409"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ad9ebe4097070d11c127b7","name":"Abdel H.","lastName":"Harrath","documentHash":"8324fb1b-b82e-4794-ba70-b54c18f40f70"},{"objectId":"63ad9ebe4097070d11c127b6","name":"Saleh","lastName":"Alwasel","documentHash":"be16690b-b5a5-4624-a390-62dc232e9e28"},{"objectId":"63ad9ebe4097070d11c127b5","name":"Miloš","lastName":"Mlynček","documentHash":"2dc59339-86b5-41af-97c8-da03f3170a72"},{"objectId":"63ad9ebe4097070d11c127b4","name":"Zuzana","lastName":"Fabova","documentHash":"1b69d8fb-1f05-4aa7-bb87-80f2e9f5e3df"},{"objectId":"63ad9ebe4097070d11c127b3","name":"Adam","lastName":"Tarko","documentHash":"8aa6051b-eda0-4ba8-8aab-6511a7cb1261"},{"objectId":"63ad9ebe4097070d11c127b2","name":"Alexander V.","lastName":"Sirotkin","documentHash":"095cce1c-f7d6-49ed-aad0-f21662930c99"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c28","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kotwica","uuid":"385A852C4444CB9E0834360EA9CB5447DAA8769BC4824DF6157291803425A6E6379F07FED1C99EFB7D5F465E5A6BE9848257FE25794C37B2D7DB4C3937D900CE","documentHash":"3d7a4dfa-c22d-4959-9a2f-2a1c9f18e44c"}],"objectId":"63ad9ebe4097070d11c127b1","doi":"10.1071/rd22154","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85142401725&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Direct action of leptin, obestatin and ginkgo on hormone release by luteinised human ovarian granulosa cells [Erratum: Reproduction, Fertility and Development 2022, 34(18): 1128-1146, doi: 10.1071/RD22154_CO]","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"CONTEXT: The role of metabolic hormones, medicinal plants and their interrelationships in the control of human reproductive processes are poorly understood. AIMS: To examine how leptin, obestatin and ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) affect human ovarian hormone release. \nMETHODS: We analysed the influence of leptin and obestatin alone and in combination with ginkgo extract on cultured human ovarian granulosa cells. The release of progesterone (P), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), oxytocin (OT) and prostaglandin F (PGF) were analysed by enzyme immunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. \nKEY RESULTS: Leptin addition promoted the release of all the measured hormones. Obestatin stimulated the release of P, IGF-I and OT and inhibited PGF output. Ginkgo suppressed P, IGF-I and OT and promoted PGF release. Furthermore, ginkgo changed the stimulatory action of leptin on PGF to an inhibitory one. \nCONCLUSIONS: Leptin and obestatin are involved in the control of human ovarian hormone release and ginkgo influences their function. \nIMPLICATIONS: Leptin and obestatin could be useful as stimulators of human ovarian cell functions. The suppressive influence of ginkgo on ovarian function should lead to the development of ginkgo-containing drugs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"34","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"1128-1134","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ad9ebe4097070d11c127b2","63ad9ebe4097070d11c127b3","63ad9ebe4097070d11c127b4","63ad9ebe4097070d11c127b5","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c28","63ad9ebe4097070d11c127b6","63ad9ebe4097070d11c127b7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479506","mniswId":"17195","title":"Reproduction Fertility and Development","issn":"1031-3613","documentHash":"25d8a2fc-79e0-4405-8bc4-70c609b5fe80"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654733976"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59e8","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":"FFF1C302A4ED581F77AA01D5950E55F14D23CDBCDAD59F843C36670289FB7C56D37700578F5282A4A9F572D9B626394E4F8E70F38AD1BE8043807EDC54FA76BB","documentHash":"e11b06a4-6f92-4cb7-b88c-c8e09d0b50ab"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b588f","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kowalik","uuid":"7A7C3A9F21F6AB89CF7A93BE9AFD84358C361AF1ED8C2FD983B77498398EB447F35B9C99B1AA1CBA0B31DD725219020B8BC567823865E988B3DAE715A8E589D5","orcidId":"0000-0001-7637-0911","documentHash":"bc59a033-f672-4d53-adfe-4d685d38e0cd"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afaa5","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Młynarczuk","uuid":"4DA291311B702E990D8DB235AB419AFFAFBF983457AD19DCA4F7B2658DD515E8A776861CA6F3B879E9AD3255BECA587D87865812AF36FBFBEF368518A528182A","documentHash":"fbf2bcf2-336f-4cc7-a5ad-6caeb5860ef9"}],"objectId":"63ad87274097070d11bf8bff","doi":"10.1530/joe-21-0336","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85129999169&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Do cypermethrin and fenvalerate disturb the function of the bovine cervix in vitro?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed to investigate the effect of pyrethroid insecticides on the regulation of bovine cervical function. Cervical cells or strips obtained from cows during the periovulation period were treated with cypermethrin and fenvalerate (0.1-10 ng/ml). None of the pyrethroids exerted a cytotoxic effect, whereas only fenvalerate increased the cervical contraction force and mRNA expression of receptor of oxytocin (ROT) and prostaglandin (PG) synthases. Both pyrethroids inhibited PG secretion and decreased the amount of diacylglycerol (DAG), which is the second messenger involved in oxytocin signal transmission, and fenvalerate decreased the myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) level. These finding indicate that fenvalerate induces greater disruption of cervical function than

and oxidative stress, develops an efficient but not fully recognized system of repair and antioxidant protection. Here, using mass spectrometry analysis (LC–MS/MS), followed by in vitro and in vivo experiments, we provided evidence that Foxn1 in keratinocytes regulates elements of the electron transport chain and participates in the thioredoxin system (Txn2, Txnrd3, and Srxn1) induction, particularly in a hypoxic environment. We first showed that Foxn1 in keratinocytes upregulates glutathione thioredoxin reductase 3 (Txnrd3) protein expression, and high levels of Txnrd3 mRNA were detected in injured skin of Foxn1+/+ mice. We also showed that Foxn1 strongly downregulated the Ccn2 protein expression, participating in epidermal reconstruction after injury. An in vitro assay revealed that Foxn1 controls keratinocyte migration, stimulating it under normoxia and suppressing it under hypoxia. Keratinocytes overexpressing Foxn1 and exposed to hypoxia displayed a reduced ability to promote angiogenesis by downregulating Vegfa expression. In conclusion, this study showed a new mechanism in which Foxn1, along with hypoxia, participates in the activation of antioxidant defense and controls the functional properties of keratinocytes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c1218","5e70938d878c28a0473aca68","5e7093e1878c28a0473b27f7","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb02","5e709419878c28a0473b63ac","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"36","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"art. no e22436 (1-25)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093e1878c28a0473b27f7","5e70938d878c28a0473aca68","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1218","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11f8","63adbe094097070d11c31c6d","63adbe094097070d11c31c6e","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb02","5e709419878c28a0473b63ac"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ca5","mniswId":"6522","title":"FASEB JOURNAL","issn":"0892-6638","documentHash":"b96c9084-4e4b-457a-a6be-a9808bd7ffd2"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654768232"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ad91aa4097070d11c06a5e","name":"Yael","lastName":"Heifetz","documentHash":"00081783-8c12-44b8-aca6-2a3fd7d354fe"},{"objectId":"63ad91aa4097070d11c06a5d","name":"Zaneta P.","lastName":"Reliszko","documentHash":"f30d3654-afba-4cdc-b5b7-89b536422a1e"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":"4C887615D8CF2C7AED96BBBF9BA5C5F08ED58C03893B40229F8B7BC60591947D230EB5884E4543FA7A07891B19A3B7714641EF4DB0922B7E97E35D4B3AAB996B","documentHash":"b2431fda-02ea-4ffb-9f2a-57ed6c3ab5d1"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbbb","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szuszkiewicz","uuid":"B3C96698E29462BF1C5A76532D81BE3E9DC8036C9E04D0956E04E82B221A1A26F6B1C1F1C4D3A3E47C0920C520572C363D5BCBB48E555EBF9346B7C2CB768FEC","documentHash":"06dee320-66e2-49d6-b2fb-510e5e733749"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db9c","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Myszczyński","uuid":"880A7CE391BA7DF745800FB9596A2C112A2B128DE9399F4969165F4F51A342D98754FD80BEBA5C5FAADF1ADB8931FB55C6656B5025D06201AD30A5CDC9A16F71","orcidId":"0000-0002-3118-0900","documentHash":"935ccb74-19cd-46ea-8bd7-c8b1e73a2e49"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-07-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ad91aa4097070d11c06a5c","doi":"10.1096/fj.202200677r","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85134720501&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Early steps of embryo implantation are regulated by exchange of extracellular vesicles between the embryo and the endometrium","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In early pregnancy, as the embryo arrives in the uterus, intensive communication between the embryo and uterus begins. Hundreds of molecules are known to be involved, but despite numerous findings, full understanding of the complexity of the embryo–maternal dialog remains elusive. Recently, extracellular vesicles, nanoparticles able to transfer functionally active cargo between cells, have emerged as important players in cell–cell communication, and as such, they have gained great attention over the past decade also in reproductive biology. Here, we use a domestic animal model (Sus scrofa) with an epitheliochorial, superficial type of placentation because of its advantage in studding uterine luminal fluid extracellular vesicles. We show that during early pregnancy, the uterine lumen is abundant with extracellular vesicles that carry a plethora of miRNAs able to target genes involved in embryonic and organismal development. These extracellular vesicles, upon the delivery to primary trophoblast cells, affect genes governing development as well as cell-to-cell signaling and interactions, consequently having an impact on trophoblast cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. We conclude that the exchange of a unique population of extracellular vesicles and their molecular cargo at the maternal–embryo interface is the key to the success of embryo implantation and pregnancy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej

performance in pigs. Unfortunately, the mechanism of lutein cysts formation remains unknown. Here, we compared the endocrine and molecular milieus of intact, healthy preovulatory follicles (PF), gonadotropin (eCG/hCG)-induced healthy and atretic-like PF, as well as gonadotropin-provoked and spontaneous ovarian cysts in gilts. Several endocrine and molecular indicators and microRNA were compared in walls of PF and cysts. Intact and healthy PF, showed high estradiol/androstendione and low progesterone levels associated with CYP17A1, HSD17B1, and CYP19A1 elevation and reduced StAR/HSD3B1 protein expression. In contrast, low estradiol/androstendione and high progesterone concentrations, accompanied by decreased CYP17A1, HSD17B1, CYP19A1 and increased HSD3B1 protein abundance, appeared in atretic-like PF, gonadotropin-induced and spontaneous cysts. High progesterone receptor (PGR) protein abundance was maintained in intact and healthy PF, while it dropped in atretic-like PF, gonadotropins-induced and spontaneous cysts. The atretic PF showed high level of TNFα compared to healthy PF. In conclusion, follicular lutein cysts could be recruited from atretic-like PF with lost estrogenic milieu and inability to ovulate. Ovulatory cascade was presumably disrupted by a low PGR and high TNFα levels associated with earlier luteinization of follicular walls. These results suggest a novel mechanism of lutein ovarian cysts development in pigs and, perhaps, other species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a8878c28a0473c11ad","5e709410878c28a0473b59ed","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11aa","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89","5e7092d6878c28a04739db8b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-14","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709410878c28a0473b59ed","5e7092d6878c28a04739db8b","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11aa","5e7094a8878c28a0473c11ad","65b00efa4097071977894a71","65b00efa4097071977894a72","5e70923a878c28a04739211f","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"2045-2322","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654868547"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a2878c28a0473c0bf4","name":"Michał","lastName":"Rawski","uuid":"4BB7622CCED7AF5BF3F7EE728A276DAE1FA284B403059A02BD61760A45FB5F7184DCC1B78E6DED206DD6E3C209988CFEC87161F628FF26BD208DE5EE3D4B4180","documentHash":"63ade938-63a3-4b5f-b08e-a40c46f904b9"},{"objectId":"5e70944e878c28a0473ba134","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Karnas","uuid":"33243DC243475EFAC478EBD29601D0DFCA92A26E03EAF419A20A96737BBA7C2D4CD024DF8659FC36EF93DC578F09783E3428C8659A51FA1572EBCE1246B80422","documentHash":"193f3f36-cc7c-42a1-b81f-bd3775873ee2"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d89","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":"4C887615D8CF2C7AED96BBBF9BA5C5F08ED58C03893B40229F8B7BC60591947D230EB5884E4543FA7A07891B19A3B7714641EF4DB0922B7E97E35D4B3AAB996B","documentHash":"b2431fda-02ea-4ffb-9f2a-57ed6c3ab5d1"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a82d7","name":"Maria","lastName":"Guzewska","uuid":"0331AD1CF20FB8E16484AD4B8BB8990157C27ADE20D3C2FF54E14B0009ADCFC57AC311BA0F88A6863C3DA0EE012A2B6C858346F4B207B759016275B2164115F4","documentHash":"5b96efe6-ccd8-4a86-adfa-27faa0a4385c"},{"objectId":"5e709316878c28a0473a2a9c","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Zuba-Surma","uuid":"9D5F5385AF573647088633A7D541E4FD9DFDDE0C73789A59F34E88541592DE0D4CCF0020E4CEBDE692E88B9C6CB9EB1EEB6627A2ADF11EDDDC75589A4E4D4D87","documentHash":"f9c6b678-aad5-4ecb-a215-7a8e9dfd8fc8"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739db8c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Witek","uuid":"2C277E5FD80A3685542869ABB834EEFC96FCB19A85844FD840648650CB8E9DCB4B3E1E6E62EF230BE14075E4A0E8375D3ACCD85CC5AEC73B48C2CFBCCA52E255","documentHash":"e1a5256d-3292-4679-9304-2b6a5b39c8f0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-09-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"6515ea364097070ba4d5a1fc","doi":"10.1096/fj.202300710r","publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/319164","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"miR-125b-5p impacts extracellular vesicle biogenesis, trafficking, and EV subpopulation release in the porcine trophoblast by regulating ESCRT-dependent pathway","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Abstract Intercellular communication is a critical process that ensures cooperation between distinct cell types at the embryo–maternal interface. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are considered to be potent mediators of this communication by transferring biological information in their cargo (e.g., miRNAs) to the recipient cells. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that affect the function and fate of neighboring and distant cells by regulating gene expression. Focusing on the maternal side of the dialog, we recently revealed the impact of embryonic signals, including miRNAs, on EV-mediated cell-to-cell communication. In this study, we show the regulatory mechanism of the miR-125b-5p ESCRT-mediated EV biogenesis pathway and the further secretion of EVs by trophoblasts at the time when the crucial steps of implantation are taking place. To test the ability of miR-125b-5p to influence the expression of genes involved in the generation and release of EV subpopulations in porcine conceptuses, we used an ex vivo approach. Next, in silico and in vitro analyses were performed to confirm miRNA–mRNA interactions. Finally, EV trafficking and release were assessed using several imaging and particle analysis tools. Our results indicated that conceptus development and implantation are accompanied by changes in the abundance of EV biogenesis and trafficking machinery. ESCRT-dependent EV biogenesis and the further secretion of EVs were modulated by miR-125b-5p, specifically impacting the ESCRT-II complex (via VPS36) and EV trafficking in primary porcine trophoblast cells. The identified miRNA–ESCRT interplay led to the generation and secretion of specific subpopulations of EVs. miRNA present at the embryo–maternal interface governs EV-mediated communication between the mother and the developing conceptus, leading to the generation, trafficking, and release of characteristic subpopulations of EVs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w

extensively studied, the data related to gender differences in aspects of skin scarring are limited. The present study performed on abdominal human intact and scar skin focused on determining gender differences in extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT) accumulation, and Foxn1 expression as a part of the skin response to injury. Scar skin of men showed highly increased levels of COLLAGEN 1A1, COLLAGEN 6A3, and ELASTIN mRNA expression, the accumulation of thick collagen I-positive fibers, and the accumulation of $\\alpha$-SMA-positive cells in comparison to the scar skin of women. However, post-injured skin of women displayed an increase (in comparison to post-injured men’s skin) in collagen III accumulation in the scar area. On the contrary, women’s skin samples showed a tendency towards higher levels of adipogenic-related genes ($PPAR\\gamma$, FABP4, LEPTIN) than men, regardless of intact or scar skin. Intact skin of women showed six times higher levels of LEPTIN mRNA expression in comparison to men intact (p < 0.05), men post-injured (p < 0.05), or women post-injured scar (p < 0.05) skin. Higher levels of FOXN1 mRNA and protein were also detected in women than in men’s skin. In conclusion, the present data confirm and extend (dWAT layer) the data related to the presence of differences between men and women in the skin, particularly in scar tissues, which may contribute to the more effective and gender-tailored improvement of skin care interventions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w

involvement","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The phenomenon of remaining paramesonephric ducts (uterus masculinus) in males of some animal species concerning its role is still an unresolved issue. Now it is well-recognized that sex hormonal regulation of reproductive physiology involves also fast nongenomic control of cellular processes through noncanonical signaling. Herein, in the uterus masculinus of Eurasian beaver membrane androgen receptor (metal ion transporter Zrt- and Irt-like protein 9; ZIP9) and membrane estrogen receptor (G protein-coupled estrogen receptor; GPER) were studied. Scanning electron microscopy together with anatomical analysis revealed that Eurasian male beavers possess one double uterus (uterus duplex). Two odd parts open into the vagina but do not form a common lumen. The length of the horns is the most differential feature of this organ in studied animals. Uterus masculinus is not a tightly closed tubular structure. Histological analysis showed an analogy to the female uterus structure however no glands but gland-like structures were observed. The presence and abundant localization of ZIP9 and GPER proteins in cells of uterus masculinus was confirmed by immunohistochemistry while their expression was measured by western blotting. GPER expression in remnants was lower (P < 0.001) than those in the female uterus. Parallelly, the concentration of progesterone and estradiol but not testosterone was lower (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) in comparison to the female uterus. Our study, for the first time, reports the involvement of fast hormonal regulation in the uterus masculinus of Eurasian beavers reflecting the participation of this organ in the creation local hormonal environment. Moreover, the uterus masculinus seems to be a useful research model for understanding and resolving urgent biological problems such as gender identities and having children by women with a lack of uterus or anatomical barriers on this level."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709316878c28a0473a2b9a","5e709319878c28a0473a2c58","5e70942b878c28a0473b77e3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["615fad2875234017e0505d84","5e7094f6878c28a0473c8084","5e7093b2878c28a0473af611"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"66d90292ece3980cc87bb775","uid":"bs2oBBXSJ_LqYZZ63Yv7J7A","uuid":"7847e09c-18f2-47c0-aa78-7389c9de127a","name":"Wydział Medycyny Weterynaryjnej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709316878c28a0473a2a78","5e709224878c28a04739095e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"345","pagesFromTo":"1-8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709316878c28a0473a2a78","65e5c6884097076263d12763","5e70942b878c28a0473b77e3","5e7094f6878c28a0473c8084","5e709319878c28a0473a2c58","5e709316878c28a0473a2b9a","5e7093b2878c28a0473af611","615fad2875234017e0505d84","5e709224878c28a04739095e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477dbf","mniswId":"7008","title":"General and Comparative Endocrinology","issn":"0016-6480","eissn":"1095-6840","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"a3fa1bba-883f-476a-8fdb-c71ac8df288e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sex hormones","beaver","uterus masculinus","membrane androgen receptor","membrane estrogen receptor"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654948025"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677390fdfdbe833e3d15a83c","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Mekhemar","documentHash":"4c76106f-9e73-4d1f-85a0-231952502e50"},{"objectId":"677390fdfdbe833e3d15a83b","name":"Muthamilselvan","lastName":"Muthukumar","documentHash":"deb83442-4e1e-40a7-9943-4f87a5aa2b14"},{"objectId":"677390fdfdbe833e3d15a83a","name":"Sureshkumar","lastName":"Rajalingam","documentHash":"723470ea-8a5f-4ba4-ad05-a303f64f82f0"},{"objectId":"677390fdfdbe833e3d15a839","name":"Marisennayya","lastName":"Senapathy","documentHash":"313318ad-65fc-4496-8b7a-62b454ea9e0f"},{"objectId":"677390fdfdbe833e3d15a838","name":"Surinder","lastName":"Singh","documentHash":"fbf669de-f966-413d-a7e5-861bcbd7bc73"},{"objectId":"677390fdfdbe833e3d15a837","name":"Sangram","lastName":"Dhumal","documentHash":"62549e65-476b-42c5-9e24-666880e4bb99"},{"objectId":"677390fdfdbe833e3d15a836","name":"Deepak","lastName":"Chandran","documentHash":"364713f9-b264-4b75-8776-8a586c12ec7d"},{"objectId":"677390fdfdbe833e3d15a835","name":"-","lastName":"Radha","documentHash":"790b7577-382a-4166-a315-cc3acb0b952e"},{"objectId":"677390fdfdbe833e3d15a834","name":"Sunil","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"de832dbc-db99-49d4-9fb3-189105feb471"},{"objectId":"677390fdfdbe833e3d15a833","name":"Manoj","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"224fa787-1e65-40cd-b3c9-d132a2bb28bf"},{"objectId":"677390fdfdbe833e3d15a832","name":"Jairam","lastName":"Choudhary","documentHash":"cf43e251-0479-44bd-a7f5-e8c794fdb583"},{"objectId":"677390fdfdbe833e3d15a831","name":"Ekta","lastName":"Narwal","documentHash":"d5c1ef10-2d8f-484f-a828-c07a98047df7"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Amarowicz","uuid":"E3F82F180420E17408387DA8278E31BA063B63E23FA3A3D12CDACF7782601F29880AD18F5F8B5700F19ABBF4D3A953AACDADA4C15E9856957368FBF0052CD31D","documentHash":"1a88be2c-950c-42bd-998e-3d57cbcaf519"}],"objectId":"677390fdfdbe833e3d15a830","doi":"10.1080/1040841x.2024.2321489","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Botanicals as promising antimicrobial agents for enhancing oral health: a comprehensive review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The mouth houses the second largest diversity of microorganisms in the body, harboring more than 700 bacterial species colonizing the soft mucosa and hard tooth surfaces. Microbes are the cause of several health-related problems, such as dental carries, gingivitis, periodontitis, etc., in the mouth across different age groups and socioeconomic/demographic groups. Oral infections are major health problems that affect the standard of living. Compromised oral health is related to chronic conditions and systemic disorders. Microbes responsible for dental caries are acid-producing and aciduric Gram-positive bacteria (Streptococci, Lactobacilli). Gram-negative bacteria (Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Actinobacillus, and Fusobacterium) capable of growing in anaerobic environments are responsible for periodontal diseases. Due to the high prevalence of oral diseases, negative effects associated with the use of antimicrobial agents and increased antibiotic resistance in oral pathogens, suitable alternative methods (effective, economical and safe) to suppress microbes disturbing oral health need to be adopted. Side effects associated with the chemical antimicrobial agents are vomiting, diarrhea and tooth staining. Several researchers have studied the antimicrobial properties of plant extracts and phytochemicals and have used them as indigenous practices to control several infections. Therefore, phytochemicals extracted from plants can be suitable alternatives. This review focuses on the various phytochemical/plant extracts suppressing the growth of oral pathogens either by preventing their attachment to the surfaces or by preventing biofilm formation or other mechanisms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677390fdfdbe833e3d15a831","677390fdfdbe833e3d15a832","677390fdfdbe833e3d15a833","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c27","677390fdfdbe833e3d15a834","677390fdfdbe833e3d15a835","677390fdfdbe833e3d15a836","677390fdfdbe833e3d15a837","677390fdfdbe833e3d15a838","677390fdfdbe833e3d15a839","677390fdfdbe833e3d15a83a","677390fdfdbe833e3d15a83b","677390fdfdbe833e3d15a83c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477830","mniswId":"4521","title":"Critical Reviews in Microbiology","issn":"1040-841X","eissn":"1549-7828","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"1b7b292f-f943-4910-990c-b8ce06b65d8f"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Oral healthoral","pathogens","phytochemicals","plant extract","biofilm formation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654948091"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be657","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Grabowska","uuid":"99E4EDA26D1AB0BBB99E0D5DBB59BA9C1CF38DA4C10C1EF6457AE972D5D0A5AF3B311AC06E20A64BD2505FEB1D770EB0E6F8F76F5A3AFA91BB9291924A395746","documentHash":"2b049818-67a3-4659-8d7c-ee0ddbffe8ef"},{"objectId":"5e709315878c28a0473a296a","name":"Szczepan","lastName":"Zapotoczny","uuid":"FAA907EF84923EBBE80821F472354787C26931ECA2616488CD2E93C3DCE5038444C65947B342DF77306EC707ADE675CE58FEAE2901D513A9EA0DA04935A9E84E","orcidId":"0000-0001-6662-7621","documentHash":"1dbf3050-aa83-4748-adfd-f282a13ca42e"},{"objectId":"5e709315878c28a0473a2804","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Chłopicki","uuid":"3C12E3D253F13F425259119E7F225A5B5EA354D4F96D199A8AA759E9D08F1BBDE57E99DC64D966042BCBF69F217CF306597660B49A740A69DC5F1D6C61315303","documentHash":"0943fa5a-b55d-46e2-9101-c722c3bdd45c"}],"objectId":"65e5caba4097076263d1a137","doi":"10.1016/j.trac.2023.117372","publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/323800","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Multiplex electrochemical aptasensors for detection of endothelial dysfunction : ready for prime time?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709315878c28a0473a2804","5e709315878c28a0473a296a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947f878c28a0473be657"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"169","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709315878c28a0473a296a","5e709315878c28a0473a2804","5e70947f878c28a0473be657"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547997a","mniswId":"19624","title":"TrAC -

RECENT FINDINGS: Chromatin is the physical expression of the epigenome and has a memory function on the level of DNA methylation, histone modification and 3-dimensional (3D) organization. This epigenetic memory does not only affect transient gene expression but also represents long-lasting decisions on cellular fate. The memory is based on an epigenetic programming process, which is directed by extracellular and intracellular signals that are sensed by transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. Many dietary molecules and their intermediary metabolites serve as such signals, that is they contribute to epigenetic programming and memory. In this context, we will discuss about molecules of intermediary energy metabolism affecting chromatin modifier actions, nutrition-triggered epigenetic memory in pre- and postnatal phases of life; and epigenetic programming of immune cells by vitamin D. These mechanisms explain some of the susceptibility for complex diseases, such as the metabolic syndrome, cancer and immune disorders. SUMMARY: The observation that nutritional molecules are able to modulate the epigenome initiated the new nutrigenomic subdiscipline nutritional epigenetics. The concept that epigenetic memory and programming is directed by our diet has numerous implications for the interpretation of disease risk including their prevention."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"259-265","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6226cdb87523402df08ea9c8","67695bb6fdbe8317b9a1f093"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477895","mniswId":"4743","title":"CURRENT OPINION IN CLINICAL NUTRITION AND METABOLIC CARE","issn":"1363-1950","eissn":"1473-6519","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"049be772-11de-40f5-9ea7-8bde4a83cd76"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["chromatin","epigenetic programming","intermediary metabolism","nutrition","vitamin D"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655035583"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62a009a8752340212cd2f060","name":"Róża","lastName":"Aleksandrowicz","uuid":"E36F2E7E6CA0A42FAA88D2EF9D471FC7BA67C2DD83D7445A15B6C96FDD0D30EDBB25FFD95A0AC8B95BF44EB1F5ABDE2699F1B841C9A25B6BC413F08D0CCB4DD5","documentHash":"07fd1b54-482b-4c63-888e-b16d411f5a61"},{"objectId":"5e709377878c28a0473aa543","name":"Marek","lastName":"Strączkowski","uuid":"4C90BD5CD933657E8C2E13468D0F43F9A1D03D3C42022BE096D7702400C2E683808300DF5F10899E73239C8A7EDE44524339338D4753052D40652B8E115B9111","documentHash":"1bcfdfb0-ae43-4864-a1d9-9c4626cfc48d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2023-03-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6769451dfdbe8317b9a15145","doi":"10.1530/ec-23-0023","publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85159026629&partnerID=MN8TOARS","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Link between insulin resistance and skeletal muscle extracellular matrix remodeling","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Skeletal muscle is the main metabolic tissue responsible for glucose homeostasis in the body. It is surrounded by the extracellular matrix (ECM) consisting of three layers: epimysium, perimysium, and endomysium. ECM plays an important role in the muscle, as it provides integrity and scaffolding cells. The observed disturbances in this structure are related to the abnormal remodeling of the ECM (through an increase in the concentration of its components). ECM rearrangement may impair insulin action by increasing the physical barrier to insulin transport and reducing insulin transport into muscle cells as well as by directly inhibiting insulin action through integrin signaling. Thus, improper ECM remodeling may contribute to the development of insulin resistance (IR) and related comorbidities. In turn, insulin resistance-associated conditions may further aggravate disturbances of ECM in skeletal muscle. This review describes the major components of the ECM that are necessary for it is proper function. Particular attention was also paid to receptors (integrins) involved in the signaling of metabolic pathways. Finally, changes in ECM components in the context of clinical and animal studies are discussed. This article will help the reader to systematize knowledge related to the ECM and to better understand the relationship between ECM remodeling and IR, and its role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. The information in this article presents the concept of the role of ECM and its remodeling in the pathogenesis of IR, which may contribute to developing new therapeutic solution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62a009a8752340212cd2f060","5e709377878c28a0473aa543"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art. no e230023 (1-12)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62a009a8752340212cd2f060","5e709377878c28a0473aa543"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c011","mniswId":"5653","title":"Endocrine Connections","issn":"2049-3614","documentHash":"079f1778-24f3-4e2a-a668-ae44856ef5bf"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["skeletal muscle","ECM remodeling","insulin resistance","metabolic diseases"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655035587"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67691686fdbe834b5156690c","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Stefanowicz","documentHash":"febdeb02-5fc4-4139-83cf-3eef1da64acd"},{"objectId":"62a009a8752340212cd2f060","name":"Róża","lastName":"Aleksandrowicz","uuid":"E36F2E7E6CA0A42FAA88D2EF9D471FC7BA67C2DD83D7445A15B6C96FDD0D30EDBB25FFD95A0AC8B95BF44EB1F5ABDE2699F1B841C9A25B6BC413F08D0CCB4DD5","documentHash":"07fd1b54-482b-4c63-888e-b16d411f5a61"},{"objectId":"5e709377878c28a0473aa543","name":"Marek","lastName":"Strączkowski","uuid":"4C90BD5CD933657E8C2E13468D0F43F9A1D03D3C42022BE096D7702400C2E683808300DF5F10899E73239C8A7EDE44524339338D4753052D40652B8E115B9111","documentHash":"1bcfdfb0-ae43-4864-a1d9-9c4626cfc48d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67691686fdbe834b5156690a","doi":"10.1507/endocrj.ej23-0151","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Skeletal muscle integrin expression in non-obese men with varying degrees of insulin sensitivity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The remodeling of skeletal muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) components is related to the degree of insulin resistance (IR). Membrane receptors such as integrins provide two-way signaling (\"inside-out\" and \"outside-in\" signaling) between ECM components of skeletal muscle (e.g., collagen, laminin, fibronectin) and intracellular signaling pathways. The aim of the study was to analyze the relationship between the expression of integrins in skeletal muscle and insulin sensitivity (IS) in young, healthy, non-obese volunteers. We studied 36 healthy non-obese male participants. Subjects were divided into three subgroups on the basis of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp: upper IS tertile, medium IS tertile, and lower IS tertile. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were performed before each clamp. Next, analysis of integrin mRNA expression was performed. Waist circumference, percent body fat, fasting serum insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol were higher in the lower IS tertile subgroup compared to the other two subgroups (p < 0.05). The lower IS tertile showed increased expression of ITGA5, ITGA6, ITGA7, SPARC (p < 0.05) in comparison with the upper IS tertile and ITGA6 (p < 0.05) compared to the medium IS tertile. ITGA2, ITGA3, ITGA5, ITGA6, ITGA7, SPARC correlated inversely with IS (p < 0.05). Skeletal muscle integrin are associated with low IS in healthy nonobese men.

However, recognition of molecular factors regulating dWAT development, homeostasis, and bioactivity is limited. Using Foxn1−/− and Foxn1+/+ mice, we demonstrated that epidermally expressed Foxn1 regulates dWAT development and defines the adipogenic capacity of dermal fibroblasts. In intact and post-wounded skin, Foxn1 contributes to the initial stimulation of dWAT adipogenesis and participates in the modulation of lipid metabolism processes. Furthermore, Foxn1 activity strengthens adipogenic processes through Bmp2 and Igf2 signaling and regulates lipid metabolism in differentiated dermal fibroblasts. The results reveal the contribution of Foxn1 to dWAT metabolism, thus identifying possible targets for modulation and regulation of dWAT in physiological and pathological processes in the skin. © 2023 The Authors.

This study tested the hypothesis that a period of captivity during the juvenile period and human-controlled reproduction may potentially be involved in the disruption of the development of incestuous mating avoidance behavior in sanctuary-reintroduced male Konik polski horses. Between 1986 and 2000, cases of incestuous behavior in harem stallions born and reared until weaning in the sanctuary were studied. Eight males lived in the sanctuary's feral herd for the rest of their lives (the non-captive group; nC). They gained their own harem of mares without human intervention (no human-controlled reproductive activity, nHC). Another five stallions were removed as weanlings, reared in captivity and then reintroduced as adults (captive, C). Three of these C stallions were used as in-hand breeding stallions, one as a “teaser” (human-controlled reproductive activity, HC) and one was not used for reproduction in captivity (nHC). Reproductive records for 46 mares, daughters of all 13 harem stallions, were scrutinized and cases of incestuous breeding were recorded by interrogation of foal parentage records. C stallions failed to expel more daughters than nC stallions (33% vs. 18%, P = 0.045), and mated with significantly more of them (28% vs. 11%, P = 0.025). Interestingly, HC stallions expelled fewer (60%) and successfully mated with more (33%) daughters that nHC stallions (84% expelled, P = 0.013, and 10% successful mating with daughters, P = 0.010). All HC stallions bred incestuously at least once.\n\nWe propose that human intervention during a critical period of development of social and reproductive behavior in young stallions, by enforced separation from their natal herd and in-hand breeding, may contribute to their later aberrant behavior and disruption of inbreeding avoidance mechanisms in these stallions. The previous occurrence of human-controlled breeding may be one of the factors promoting incestuous behavior of stallions in natural conditions. The uninterrupted presence of stallions in their harems and herd member recognition may also play important roles in inbreeding avoidance in horses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a047399792"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fc6c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b3878c28a0473af64a","5e7093b2878c28a0473af55c","5e70945e878c28a0473bb92a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"180","pagesFromTo":"82-86","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a1878c28a047399792","5e70945e878c28a0473bb92a","5e7093b3878c28a0473af64a","5e709217878c28a04738fc6c","61d2d3752467f0718b04ad7d","5e7093b2878c28a0473af55c","61d2d3752467f0718b04ad7f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479934","mniswId":"19490","title":"Theriogenology","issn":"0093-691X","eissn":"1879-3231","documentHash":"5a895e76-bf91-415f-9ad3-e560a5ae5bdf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d2d3752467f0718b04ad81","year":"2022","volume":"180","documentHash":"890d3d2c-5445-44f9-9947-975a828b9e64"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Feral horse","Incest","Reproductive behavior","Inbreeding avoidance","Koniks"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747779468019"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c5d","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Gilun","uuid":"EBB0736F40C74D6B2D695ABC3356820E26879E44731C1E6BE134E2AA01BE660165DB5E4115FDAC2A7BB0C3F286A199DEA9AAEB3518EC79FB7F55AEC054F9C603","documentHash":"3de72312-e938-4c4f-90f1-cec3b43ae150"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb73","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Wąsowska","uuid":"AECE7258B2E1135409B11F4421C3D70F2F5E76461FB39DC54E62A25B4B20EA5D4376A6ABAB91AEBA675B85425AA99C49AD16D5A19AB717122735CFFE83ADF50F","documentHash":"d58264bb-1003-48b1-a92b-a1f68342c0c6"},{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae1c7","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"536B95C997D55FA0B27CED25AD553FA816883FAC007675CF3782B90AD158CC0C34389D8A45A03C83FA96BEBEDDFE67A2F49FE408422B0AE03C0990F78B615AEE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7065-4451","documentHash":"893f2af3-089c-4665-9bfc-acb9ef4a72dc"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390dca","name":"Maria","lastName":"Romerowicz-Misielak","uuid":"58C136FDC9975CA04CB1B24AEB8FF08544B37ED4F619AA1C41BF45CFEC2F0C835A62EB5529C39A8E1BC990DA9C9B10952299C9E256A4783D3970A1114000848A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2101-7365","documentHash":"0a45e6d6-0f17-4d3b-93f3-97f58a129757"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fc85","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Koziorowska-Gilun","uuid":"6290A31B91DD99487ABF789B00AAF3769208556499025BF8E70863E44CC1E0F577B79DFEB7F1FBC4EE6D7BA51105846B95E1FCD9B52E9D990D518C35CEC7A764","orcidId":"0000-0002-4484-6601","documentHash":"4d8ed8c6-e907-403d-b16f-31e45dffa014"},{"objectId":"5e709216878c28a04738fbb0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kozioł","uuid":"559A1DA683D9DAF682590D575B285E4CBD820A3A12610BF0F279694C9B53470656DBF6460FAF3E5F2AA6DE7C5BD7BA08DACF1831707F9C193786B3FFFE95EF94","orcidId":"0000-0002-2212-5176","documentHash":"28511bca-7799-4e86-89bc-07d718845a3a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"621f858d2467f07479836c98","doi":"10.3390/biomedicines10020358","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/2/358/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Carbon Monoxide (CO) as a Retinal Regulator of Heme Oxygenases -1, and -2 (HO’s) Expression","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Carbon monoxide (CO) has been proposed as a chemical light signal and neural system modulator via heme oxygenases -1 and -2 (HO-1 and HO-2).

In this in vivo experiment, we used three groups of pigs: control—housed in natural conditions without any procedures; without CO—adapted and kept in constant darkness, infused with blank plasma; and with CO—adapted and kept in constant darkness infused with CO-enriched plasma. After the experiments, each animal was slaughtered and its eyes were collected for further analysis. Quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to show statistical differences in the expressions between the experimental groups. Our data revealed that exogenous CO is regulator of mRNA transcription for HO-1 and HO-2 and PCNA. Moreover, the mRNA abundance of analyzed factors in the experimental group after CO elevation revealed a restored gene-expression level similar to the control group, which we had observed in the group’s restored protein level after CO elevation. In conclusion, exogenous CO regulates HO’s and PCNA gene expression on transcriptional and translational levels in a similar way as a light cue."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709229878c28a047390dca","5e7093a1878c28a0473ae1c7","5e709216878c28a04738fbb0"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb73","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c5d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fc85"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"art. no 358 (1-9)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a1878c28a0473ae1c7","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c5d","5e709216878c28a04738fbb0","5e709229878c28a047390dca","5e709217878c28a04738fc85","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb73"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bb72","mniswId":"2502","title":"Biomedicines","eissn":"2227-9059","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b86ceed5-32c5-4530-92e6-238d8005ccbe"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"621f858d2467f07479836ca1","year":"2022","volume":"10","number":"2","documentHash":"01d3546c-b819-49cf-a045-8c708a4af855"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["heme oxygenase -1 and -2","carbon monoxide","retina","light signal"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747952391251"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709425878c28a0473b721f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Mańkowska","uuid":"EB7016A15D1E61F9D6CBD5605826D0876A457235F29BB62ECAF5D0D6CB2ED993A69B5FBEB0EF4ADC31E92F3A901290336EFA9BB8F91E2EBAE19433F313478EC9","orcidId":"0000-0001-8351-6499","documentHash":"bbb03d04-edd4-48dc-9c43-5233321381c9"},{"objectId":"5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c5d","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Gilun","uuid":"EBB0736F40C74D6B2D695ABC3356820E26879E44731C1E6BE134E2AA01BE660165DB5E4115FDAC2A7BB0C3F286A199DEA9AAEB3518EC79FB7F55AEC054F9C603","documentHash":"3de72312-e938-4c4f-90f1-cec3b43ae150"},{"objectId":"5e70937d878c28a0473aadf2","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Zasiadczyk","uuid":"63E1FA1FBE81762187ECE724FFEB838FB189A18DEBC6E38C317AD7096D5508854F23CA461B8BB233F57A6FE9F3D75AD8C67D78BB1ABCEA45B732C66B6BBD5067","orcidId":"0000-0001-7871-3981","documentHash":"97660cf2-5fd8-415d-82bb-73364d59377f"},{"objectId":"5e70921b878c28a04738ff7d","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Sobiech","uuid":"31109F9E5EB7AB886521D7A9227DE6F92ED779F662C7EB0558438A831201812ADAAADBA5A895704F2009B412BE9DF55816EC0820D200EA4DC94D9D0222EA76C1","orcidId":"0000-0001-9595-5907","documentHash":"dd37eb98-ddbe-49c3-9687-66160b656b56"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fc91","name":"Leyland","lastName":"Fraser","uuid":"956DC2794FEFAE32D819526CDFA7397711A6CDEFF03B50E14F5580CED9A103B527E0F7BB5034007DF1DDCE0A0143A98B9F1C4AEA71EA770B3030856CCABA10F4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2997-9991","documentHash":"d7c9a5dd-97f0-4809-bbc6-c917e6fbe605"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63088e5c409707498f0b0108","doi":"10.3390/ijms23169320","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/16/9320/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Expression of TXNRD1, HSPA4L and ATP1B1 Genes Associated with the Freezability of Boar Sperm","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cryopreservation is associated with increased oxidative stress, which is responsible for sperm damage. We analyzed the effect of cryopreservation on mRNA and protein expression of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), heat shock protein family A (HSP 70) member 4 like (HSPA4L) and sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1 (ATP1B1) genes in boar sperm with different freezability. Boars were classified as having good and poor semen freezability (GSF and PSF, respectively), according to the assessment of post-thaw sperm motility. Total RNA was isolated from fresh pre-freeze (PF) and frozen-thawed (FT) sperm from five boars of the GSF and PSF groups, respectively. Quantification of TXNRD1, HSPA4L and ATP1B1 gene expression was performed by RT-qPCR analysis. Proteins extracted from sperm were subjected to Western blotting and SDS-PAGE analyses. Poor freezability ejaculates were characterized by significantly higher relative mRNA expression levels of TXNRD1 and HSPA4L in FT sperm compared with the fresh PF sperm. Furthermore, the relative mRNA expression level of ATP1B1 was significantly higher in the fresh PF sperm of the GSF group. Western blotting analysis revealed significantly higher relative expression of TXNRD1 protein in the fresh PF sperm of the GSF group, while HSPA4L protein expression was markedly increased in FT sperm of the PSF group. Electrophoretic and densitometric analyses revealed a higher number of proteins in the fresh PF and FT sperm of the PSF and GSF groups, respectively. The results of this study indicate that ATP1B1 mRNA expression in the fresh PF sperm is a promising cryotolerance marker, while the variations of TXNRD1 and HSPA4L protein expression in the fresh PF or FT sperm provide useful information that may help to elucidate their biological significance in cryo-damage."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w

proteins with affinity to zinc ions. The aim of the study was to isolate and characterise zinc-binding proteins (ZnBPs) from stallion SP using proteomic tools. Zinc-binding proteins were isolated from the SP of eight stallions by zinc-affinity chromatography. They were analysed in the SDS-PAGE system, and peptide extracts were prepared. Samples of ZnBPs isolated from stallion SP were injected onto the nLC-1000 nanoflow HPLC system coupled via a nano-electrospray ion source to the Orbitrap Elite FTMS mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Raw MS data were analysed using MaxQuant software with label-free quantification (LFQ). Protein sequences were obtained from the UniProt database. Forty-seven proteins in ZnBPs were annotated in a gene ontology (GO) analysis. The LFQ intensity analysis of individual proteins revealed that ZnBPs comprised mainly clusterin (CLU, 27%), serin protease inhibitor F1 (SERPINF1, 13%), actin, cytoplasmic 1 (ACTB, 9%), nucleobindin 2 (NUCB2, 8%) and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR, 6%). This is the first proteomic study to analyse ZnBPs in stallion SP. The present findings show that ZnBPs in stallion SP could play an important role in the regulation of sperm function."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fc72","5e709217878c28a04738fc91","5e70921b878c28a04738ffc1","5e70921c878c28a047390153","5e709217878c28a04738fc53","602e39f89543c7410626eef2"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb02"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"961-976","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709217878c28a04738fc72","62834b8440970702b8806b94","5e709217878c28a04738fc91","602e39f89543c7410626eef2","5e70921b878c28a04738ffc1","5e70921c878c28a047390153","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb02","5e709217878c28a04738fc53"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547705d","mniswId":"1208","title":"Annals of Animal Science","issn":"1642-3402","eissn":"2300-8733","documentHash":"a7f4dbed-1a4a-48bf-84d5-8a4f7cdb5baa"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748039396375"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aec186409707743b300b62","name":"Angelika M.","lastName":"Kotlarczyk","documentHash":"e1388847-929b-4dfc-80d7-6d205262fb82"},{"objectId":"602e515a9543c7410626f0c6","name":"Nicoletta","lastName":"Neuman","uuid":"5F8025E6A1F1469F49BFFF3586BA399D8A8A9E0B1ED66E41E23033C2F678AA0F87C7F57AF5A1A9D2A31F70A562D67128E9E1ADE3CB450B6D2212D6A862A6FFD9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1932-0245","documentHash":"31da825d-c3d1-4219-8f99-6a9d851ff7c5"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af611","name":"Anna","lastName":"Korzekwa","uuid":"6CCA76174E9BF1DF35E4C1E90E2B3B9D78AF9BDADC1E212FB54879C770E920DAC45DD70A8F63FE965B8949684CD8F8490ACB631BBDD818E2C1FDBAC1061F4362","documentHash":"f996b0b0-de34-42e8-8338-b6cd4d848669"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fc85","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Koziorowska-Gilun","uuid":"6290A31B91DD99487ABF789B00AAF3769208556499025BF8E70863E44CC1E0F577B79DFEB7F1FBC4EE6D7BA51105846B95E1FCD9B52E9D990D518C35CEC7A764","orcidId":"0000-0002-4484-6601","documentHash":"4d8ed8c6-e907-403d-b16f-31e45dffa014"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fc7c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Dziekońska","uuid":"3B75EA7D82E0E9814FA47EFA5D7FE8CDD05CB974C421DC80C55062056B88CD45447F1B4EF5734D09715CB48FA31FD3049D56EAE3943BC508FAD9B3DDD5F73E72","orcidId":"0000-0002-3902-1875","documentHash":"68997e1f-dada-4ba1-8a8c-095b445bb200"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fc53","name":"Władysław","lastName":"Kordan","uuid":"092D2920AB53019AD930C691AECFA7D40F373B7F2148169275901B5C4F932413DBEEA0112A852AAFB53B84D1ED6FC2D5D48333A1D49FFAE8D40B8C153359DEE6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6842-932X","documentHash":"187e8ade-0a12-45c7-9767-d8db551170b3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aec186409707743b300b5d","doi":"10.3390/ijms232314591","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/23/14591","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The quality and fertilizing potential of red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) epididymal spermatozoa stored in a liquid state","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study was to assess the quality and fertilizing potential of red deer epididymal spermatozoa stored in a liquid state for up to 11 days (D11).

An analysis of sperm quality on D5 of storage revealed a decrease (p < 0.05) in motility and morphology, and a higher proportion of apoptotic spermatozoa. On D1, D7 and D10, the total motility of sperm for IVF and AI was determined to be 82.6%, 71.0% and 64.8%, respectively. The results of IVF and AI demonstrated that the fertilizing potential of spermatozoa differs between days of storage. The percentage of blastocysts was higher when oocytes were fertilized on D1 (17.4 %) compared to D7 (8.5%) and D10 sperm (10.5%). Differences were noted in the pregnancy rates of inseminated hinds. The insemination with D1, D7 and D10 sperm led to live births (33% from D7 and D10). The results indicate that the quality of red deer epididymal spermatozoa remains satisfactory during ten days of storage in a liquid state, and that these spermatozoa maintain their fertility
